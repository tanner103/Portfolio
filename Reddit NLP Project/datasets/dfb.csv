"'Stones into schools ' is more or less like a report on a humanitarian project carried out by an entire team of people,  with the guidance of George.  He acknowledges them in the book.  Including 'Khaled Hosseini '(The kite Runner,  A thousand Splendid Suns).  Hosseini wrote the foreword for the book.  
George is so passionate about providing young girls and boys with education in Afghanistan and Pakistan especially in the aftermath of 9/11. He built 131 schools in Afghanistan.  
  The book itself was a slow read for me but an inspiring one.

"I've read a lot of books in my life, and I've recently been lacking in challenge. Short of Umberto Eco, nothing really challenges me anymore.  H. P. Lovecraft, Neil Stevenson, Neil Gaiman, Terry Pratchett, Douglas Adams, they're all amazing - the last two are my favorite - but they aren't challenging anymore. I want a challenge.",books,330
"There is a moral to this story, which I will get to. Since I was about 10 years old, I have had a strong desire to read. I didn't always have this desire. I grew up in a lower-middle-class Christian conservative family in which the highest level of education of my parents was high school. My family believed in higher education, but only as a means to ""get that piece of paper"" (university diploma) in order to thrive in America's capitalist society. Reading outside of school for pleasure or self-education was not encouraged. As ""Christians,"" not even reading the Bible outside of the church was encouraged. To this day, I believe my family only attended church because ""it is what you do."" 

I am one of two children, and I happen to be a twin. Growing up in Texas, we were surrounded by conservative viewpoints. While we were encouraged to read outside of school curriculum by teachers and through those wonderful Scholastic Book Fairs that would arrive every year, many kids I was surrounded by just didn't seem to be interested in it. I would always feel guilty about spending money on books that were meant for pleasure because it didn't seem to serve the goal my parents had for us to ""get that piece of paper."" It wasn't until a middle school girlfriend loaned me several books from her collection of Goosebumps that I truly opened up to the idea of reading for fun. 

I consumed every Goosebumps book published at the time, which was around the mid-90s. However, I never shared my excitement about reading fiction with anyone else. Something kept me from encouraging even my twin to get into reading. To this day I'm not sure why, but I regret not sharing it for a very specific reason ‚Äî reading fiction taught me to have strong empathy for others. As a teenager, I went on to devour books by authors ranging from Stephen King to Michael Crichton to Thomas Harris to Anthony Burgess (I loved horror and science fiction and still do). It showed me how to see the world from many viewpoints, which brings me to the point of this story: we need more empathy in the world. 

I'm not intending for this story to advocate for any political ""side"" because I don't believe that is useful. Conservatives and liberals can find common ground, but only by truly hearing each other and empathizing. However, from my personal experience with my family, it has become next to impossible. Something happened over the years where they stopped listening to my pleas for discussing what's going on in the world. They have essentially cut me off intellectually. Holidays with my family have a hard rule of ""no political discussion."" While I am more liberal and open-minded, everyone else (including my twin) in my immediate family (and most of my extended family) lean highly conservative and are Trump-following (with few exceptions). They do not like discussing problems in the world, or even problems within our own family. It doesn't matter whether the topic is political or not. Feelings are suppressed rather than expressed. It is truly distressing to me that this feeling of emptiness exists within my family, which compelled me to write this post. If this story can help younger generations avoid the same dysfunction within their own families, then I've done my part. 

Share your love for reading and encourage others! I truly believe it has shaped who I am today (as cheesy as that sounds). Thank you for reading my ramblings :)",books,3430

"It was bad. Very very bad.

Some background: I've never read Tom Wolfe before now, and picked up this book because it was $5 at BAM. I initially thought it was a nonfiction book, but quickly learned it wasn't. I imagine The Right Stuff/The Electric Kool-Aid Test is probably better than this as Wolfe's a journalist, but I don't know. Also, I'm a white guy who's never been to Miami reviewing this book about race (sort of), but also, Wolfe was a white guy from VA, so it's probably fine. Spoilers, obviously. 

Back to Blood is a 704 page novel with little plot and too many characters. Our two main characters are Nestor Camacho, a Cuban cop who, after scaling a pole to arrest a Cuban man who is trying to get asylum in America, is outed by his community as a traitor. His girlfriend, Magdalena, breaks up with him suddenly to date her boss, the most famous sex addiction psychiatrist in Miami. Here lie two different ""plot"" points: Nestor, in his attempts to regain favor, assaults a black man with cocaine (in a pretty racistly-worded section, in that ""nothing good happens in this part of town""), breaks a case that a black kid (again!) assaulted a teacher, though the teacher had been arrested for assaulting him, and that the large amount of paintings given to the Miami Art Museum were all forgeries in a large Russian con job. Magdalena, on the other hand, sort of just goes around with her sex-addicted sex addiction psychiatrist boyfriend. Then it ends. 

Now, the plot is horrible, in that I read 704 pages and the above is the best way I can summarize it. But the writing-atrocious! All thoughts are written ::::::like this:::::::, and there are about ten italicized words (for emphasis) per page. There is so much repetition in the description, and not a single word of this book was edited, I think. For some reason, Wolfe's use of iPhone as a verb really gets me, as well as the fake names for Leonardo DiCaprio and Keanu Reaves (Leon Decapito and Kanyu Reade). 

Now on to, in my opinion, the worst part. Every woman is described in relation to her sexual appeal (even when narrated by heterosexual women), and every man is described as large or small. Take this, a description of a character we don't spend hardly any time with, but Nestor ends up with at the end: 

""Out here on the porch he saw her in the light for the first time. ::::::*Dios mio!* She's so *exotica!*:::::: He couldn't stop staring. He looked up up and down far faster than it takes to say so. Her skin was as white and smooth as a china plate-but her hair was black as black could be...well, straight, thick, shimmering, streaming down to her shoulders as luxuriantly as any *cubana's* but black as black could be...and her eyes...staring at him wide-open with fright-and all the more gorgeous for that-and black as black could be...but in a china-white face. Her lips were delicate and curved in a certain mysterious way(took some out here)she's totally innocent of make up-but hold on! That's not really true, is it! He has just noticed the eye shadow. ::::::She's got the rims of her lower lids coated with it!-really names her big eyes pop out! And don't tell me she's not aware of that...and hey, don't tell me she's not aware of how short her skirt is-or does it just *happen* to show off her lovely long legs, the kind they call lissome...what other white *americana* would *dare* turn up at a raggedy dope den in Overtown showing off a pair of lissomely alluring legs like that?::::::...She doesn't look very daring at this moment, however. She keeps blinking blinking blinking blinking...She keeps her lips parted, because she's breathing fast....and with that her breasts rise and fall. They're beneath a shirt, Oxford cloth, which has a coarse weave, button-down, only the top button open on the shirtfront, which amounts to not even *trying* to be sensual-even hidden this well they look to Nestor like perfection, those breasts...and somehow, her obvious fear moves the heart of Nestor...Nestor the Protector...""

I did not add in the ellipses. I only omitted one bit. That is one page, and that's how the entire book is written. This is right after he beat down a man, and this woman is actually Haitian, which may be why he's describing her as white, to show that she is white-passing (Tom Wolfe's words). 

This is, however, the worst part of the book. Magdalena is at an art gallery with Norman, her boyfriend, and Maurice, a client/billionaire. NSFW. 

&gt;!Now she stood stark naked in front of a big puddle of heavy black cloth...rigid, erect. Her face was a blank....She looked like one of the undead in a horror movie...without a stitch on. Magdalena whispered to Norman, ""Let's leave-now!"" She nodded toward Maurice. Norman just shook his head...No. The stark naked woman appeared to be fifteen years to old and fifteen pounds too heavy to play this role, whatever it was. She began speaking in the dead voice of the undead. ""Men have fucked me...they have fucked me, fucked me, fucked me over, over-fucked me-""...on and on with this I Was A Fucking Zombie poem-until all at once she inserted a thumb and two fingers into her vagina and pulled out a length of sausage and came alive, as it were, and cried out, ""De-fucked!""-and out came another sausage-""De fucked!"" and ""De fucked!"" and ""De fucked!"" and ""De fucked!"" Magdalena couldn't believe how many link sausages the woman had managed to stuff inside her vaginal cavity! Maurice had his hand clasped over his crotch. But instead of stroking it with his hand, he was rocking his body back and forth beneath his hand."" !&lt;

Was anyone expecting the end to be just Charles being executed by the Patriots, thus making it a normal tragedy? I did like the ending though. But never did I ever expect that Carton would sacrifice himself by replacing himself with Charles until the very page in which he makes Charles unconscious and asks Barsad to take him out of the prison as Carton.

I expected it to be just a commentary on the French society during the French revolution, but in addition to that it turned out to be a kind of thriller in the final chapters and then a bittersweet tragedy at the end.",books,836

"Normally I don‚Äôt have a preference between book or audiobook - I just borrow the format that‚Äôs available in my library.¬†


So last year, I read The Call of Cthulhu and Other Weird Stories which is a collection of Lovecraft‚Äôs most famous short stories. And that book took me almost two months to read because it was a difficult read, linguistically. Lovecraft‚Äôs style of writing is very complex and his range of vocabulary is insane. As much as I enjoyed some of the stories in the book, I constantly had to take breaks and read something else because this book was exhausting to read.¬†

But a couple of months after reading that book I found a podcast of a guy reading Shadow Over Innsmouth; it was basically an audiobook. And I had next to no difficulty understanding the text. Guessing the meaning of words and understanding complex sentences were so much easier when they‚Äôre being read properly. Maybe this sounds a bit obvious, but the difference was so stark that I just need to mention it. 

On the flip side, there‚Äôs Dune. These days I only borrow digitally through Libby and my library only has the audiobook for Dune and not the ebook. I tried listening to the audiobook on two different occasions and I gave up after a couple of dozen pages both times. I thought this book was impossible to follow. So many characters, so many expositions, and so many made-up words were just dropped on the audience. And barely anything happened in the first two hundred or so pages that the audiobook just felt unengaging. 

But after the Dune trailer dropped recently, I went and bought myself a physical copy. A week later and now I‚Äôm officially a Dune fan. With a book this dense, it was paramount that I read at my own pace and take a moment to swallow all the info. 

TL;DR: If you have difficulty understanding a book at a linguistic level, try the audiobook. Meanwhile, if a book is just so dense with info, read the ebook/physical copy. The difference is way bigger than you think.",books,1984

"Just looked at my Kindle app and I‚Äôm 58% complete. I bought it on recommendations from here and other sources, but never read what it about before diving in.

The Story:  

The skies had grown dark this night. 

Much darker than usual. 

Molly left her small little home and stepped down the staircase in front of her step by step. As she was standing out on her lawn looking around left and right, up and down when she started hearing something, something very faint, rumbly and dark but loud. Something curious was happening that very dark night, Molly was swinging her head in all directions, and as her head was tilted up, the sky seemed to instantaneously erupt almost like a volcano, and the once grey, cloudy dull sky, cleared up and was now a shining almost blinding red light. Almost an entire minute later Molly's eyes started to properly focus again. It was a beautiful site to see, terrifying yet beautiful. What at first looked like a red sheet covering the sky was now clear, a giant red beam going straight across illuminating the air around it. Like a snake constricting the Earth. Her eyes widened as she stared longer and longer at the shining red beam, she began looking around her but nobody was there, this, however, was incredibly strange as she could have sworn she saw her neighbors outside their homes as well just a minute ago.

She stood there staring at the terrible beauty in front of her when suddenly screams could be heard coming from all around her. Molly turned her head to look in their direction but saw nothing, she looked back up once more at the wonderful red snake in the sky, she stared and stared and stared and stared as her eyes once again became blind, blinded by a deep dark wet red, her eyes started to sting, she wanted to blink, rub her eyes, she wanted to wake up and be rid of this feeling but she couldn‚Äôt. Her eyes went from stinging to burning a burning sensation making her feel as if her eyes are melting, mixing with the viscous red liquid blinding her as they began dripping down her face like tears. Molly wanted to scream she wanted to run she wanted anyone to save her from this torture but she couldn‚Äôt she was frozen, her face burning, her body cold. She heard them, all of them, her neighbors, her friends, her school crush, her family, everyone she knew, and didn‚Äôt. She saw nothing but red covering her eyes, in that red void a voice which she did not recognize could be heard, something, something none human something unnatural was speaking. The voice was speaking but Molly didn‚Äôt understand. She was nothing, she saw nothing, she heard nothing, she wanted nothing. Little did little Molly realize but that is what she wanted, that is what she was. As she stood there in her lawn looking at the red snake, swinging her head around in all directions and seeing her neighbors standing on their lawns staring upward and feeling her mother‚Äôs arm on her shoulder. She once again looked up to the snake and smiled with red covering her eyes and her body still, she just wanted to stare, she just wanted to look, nothing more and nothing less.",books,3233
"I've been looking into the different translations of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy, and I can't decide on which one is the best for me. I want to buy the right one because I will be ordering the book online and I don't want to have to buy another one if I end up not liking that one translation.

I want a version that has that russian feel to it, preferably with the french passages in french. But I'm afraid I wont be able to enjoy it.

"Back during the height of Twilight I kept tabs and read the series in earnest as they released and fanfic galore. At some point I found on the shelves Nightlight, bought it on a whim and placed it upon my shelves where it collected dust for about 10 years.

Well last week as I reorganized my growing collection I happened upon this book and decided this time I would read it- this is my regretful report.

‚Äî

The first page I thought, ‚Äúspot on, this sounds exactly like I imagine a spoof of Bella would sound like. Then it got worse, but first I admit there were some bits that made me laugh out loud.

Things like: 

‚ÄúThanks. Maybe we‚Äôll have another class together,‚Äù I said, giving him something to live for.

And:

‚ÄúI‚Äôm Belle.‚Äù
‚ÄúI know. We‚Äôve introduced ourselves before. Like, four times.‚Äù
‚ÄúOh, sorry, I have a hard time remembering things that won‚Äôt be useful to me later.‚Äù

These little quips kept me going at first thinking I‚Äôd the whole book was littered with these nuggets than I‚Äôm sureI can make it through.

There weren‚Äôt.

In fact I didn‚Äôt laugh again until the very end, and at that point I had stopped taking notes as I often do while reading a book, so I have no more memorable or written quotes to offer.

At this point I‚Äôve nigh forgotten the entirely forgettable book. Every page was a jab at the series or author, as expected. Indeed the goal of parody was met.

The writing was spot on in mocking Bellas first person perspective. The character flaws and elements of the original were indeed exaggerated. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, this book was not bad. It is extremely well written. In fact, I compare it to the Reddit dilemma of: do I upvote this because it‚Äôs so terrible but in the correct sub, or do I down vote to spare future viewers?

I was so lost in the story, lost in the characters, but in the worst possible way. I couldn‚Äôt put the book down because I so eagerly could not leave it unfinished. I had to know if it got better, I had to know how it ended. And with every page knowing it won‚Äôt get better, like my ex I still went back over and over hoping the next page or chapter would finally satisfy me.

Then at last, satisfaction arrived. Not because I had been consumed in passion, but because it was over. A few hours of my life gone, but I did it.

Immediately following the close of that book I thought to myself, I haven‚Äôt read The Short Second Life of Bree Tanner, and now half way through it fragments of Nightlight remain with me, tainting my joy and experience with Bree.

"A few days back I was watching videos on "" How to read philosophy books"". The reason behind this was the fact that I was really bad at reading philosophical texts. After watching a few videos, I decided to start reading some Nietzsche. Just as I was to open the Ebook, I noticed a video by the title of  ""Don't be afraid of tough books- A community challenge #nofeartoughbooks"" by  a guy named R.C Waldun. I had watched a few videos of this guy before, I enjoyed them. After watching this video I am became motivated to start reading ""The Portable Nietzsche"". I am going to read 2 pages a  day for the next 1 month along with this I am going to read "" Meditations"" by Marcus Aurelius( 5 pages a day). If you are like  me who has difficulty reading hard books then  I have a few suggestion for you: 

1) Don't be scared. Pick a book(no matter how hard it is) and start reading

2) Stop being distracted.Don't spend too much time on Reddit or on GoodRead. Just start reading it.

3) If it's a philosophical book. Read less and think more. Reading Philosophical texts take time. Ponder on what you read. Also know about the person who has wrote. Try to understand why did he/she write it? What is he trying to say? 

4) If it is a book like Ulysses then read 10 pages or 20 pages a day and try to understand it.

"I will be the first to admit that I'm a bit of a Joe Hill fan, he has been one of the few authors that made it onto my 'buy on release date' list, but I took him off after Strange Weather. I wasn't overly enthusiastic about the collection and I figured I would wait and see for his next collection. So I was a bit apprehensive going into Full Throttle. While there are always stories in a collection that you might not enjoy as much as others in the same collection, I enjoyed Full Throttle as a whole and loved several of the short stories.

My personal favorite from the collection was *Late Returns*. While the supernatural aspects where there it didn't veer into horror territory which I found quite refreshing about halfway through the collection. I felt the story got across how important books can be to a person and that there can be a right time to read a book. 

*All I Care About Is You* came in a close second. I mostly enjoyed this one because Hill showed in this one how he can paint an image of a character and a world without necessarily going out of his way to fill in all the details. I thought the story contain a very clever balance between creating his own world and using the existing knowledge of the average reader to paint a complete picture. He does something similar in *Faun,* but the reference (at least the ones I took from it) were a bit more obvious and direct. 

Another favorite was *Twittering from the Circus of the Dead.* While telling a story in the form of tweets might be a bit gimmicky (and I've seen it done before), Hill still gets across perfectly well that we are dealing with a regular family, a sulky teenager that classes with her mother, an annoying younger brother and a father that is preferring to ignore it all, that are doomed to a several day roadtrip. He turn the mundane into something scary. 

Unfortunately I picked up the kindle version, so I didn't get the formatting that *The Devil on the Staircase* was originally presented in, namely the words are presented in the staircases. The story itself is another of my favorites and I agree with Hill that the story works in traditional format, I have a soft spot for gimmicky, so I would have liked to have read it in staircase format. 

The collection also contains two stories he wrote together with Stephen King. I found these to be a bit more 'traditional' horror, while I felt his own stories were a bit more surprising and entertaining. There is nothing wrong with the Stephen King stories, but I liked the variety that Hill's stories contained a bit more. 

Which were your favorite stories in the collection?",books,2624
"I finally took the dive to read HPL works and read Mountains of Madness, Call of Cthulu, and The Thing on the Doorstep.

While I did enjoy them, this sort of down-to-earth monologue wasnt what I expected. After seeing and reading hype for years and some cursory glances at some wikipedia pages, I thought I was about to read something truly cosmic - sublime glimpses into the sordid inner workings of an infinite and incomprehensible universe. Monolithic beings of inconceivable malice and/or indifference who warp time, space, and sanity just by existing. Mystery and intrigue that stretch back millions of years and undermine every perceived understanding humans have about the origins of mankind and reality.

Instead what I got was... Wordy 1930s autistic dudes discovering some funky stuff, Scooby-doo style.

Like I said, they were enjoyable reads, but I went into this with a hunger that was not sated. But maybe I'm looking at this with the wrong perspective. If I am, could someone enlighten me? What here is supposed to fill me with bone-chilling awe? Am I just an awful millenial with an annoyingly high bar of stimulus?

While I'm at it, are there any books out there that do fulfill the description I wrote above to any degree?",books,1240

"I'm not reading Pride and Prejudice for school or anything, I'm just reading it because pretty much everyone on the planet seems to love it, and it's making me feel pretty stupid. (That's aside from it convincing me, so far, that it's characters are all part of the race of space lizards secretly ruling the world. Who hell talks or thinks like this, even at the time it was written? And how it's already setting up to be an early example of ""not like other girls"" nonsense. Gonna ignore that for now, though.)

I don't know if this sub's quite the place, but I just want to go over an example of what's not clicking for me, reading comprehension-wise, to get some idea of exactly how stupid I am. This is probably going to be more confusing that what I'm reading, anyways, so... sorry for that.

So, chapter five. There's a couple of things here that confuse me already.

First of all, this sentence:
*""That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.""*

So far, as far as I know ""the assembly"" has referred to the group of people Mr. Bennett brought with him to the ball, but none of them are here, so it's referring to... the ball itself? But that can't be right, because the sentence makes no grammatical sense that way, who ""brought the former to Longbourne""? Is that referring to someone from an earlier sentence, actually? Lady Lucas? Even then, shouldn't it say ""**she** brought the former to Longbourne"" for it to make any sense?


Then there's then a long string of dialogue, seemingly between Charlotte and Elizabeth's mother (Mrs. Bennett), until this confusing mess:
*""‚ÄúMy overhearings were more to the purpose than yours, Eliza,‚Äù said Charlotte. ‚ÄúMr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend, is he?‚Äîpoor Eliza!‚Äîto be only just tolerable.""""*

Who? What? So Charlotte's actually talking to Elizabeth? Why would she then also be referring to Elizabeth as if she isn't there (""poor Eliza!"") And if she's been talking to Elizabeth this whole time, why was she called *Mrs.* Bennett which has been exclusive to her mother, especially when she isn't married? This conversation's lost me.

Two paragraphs later it seems like Jane refers to her own mother as ma'am. If that's actually who she's speaking to. Her mother also refers to her own husband as ""Mr Bennett"", so I suppose it wouldn't be too surprising for this bizarro family.",books,2500
"It‚Äôs hard for me to really decide which book I like more; the first in the series or this one. I think I‚Äôd have to go with this one being better by a small margin, and that‚Äôs mainly because the first book serves as more of an introduction to Hyperion‚Äôs universe and as build up for the climax, which is nearly the entirety of The Fall of Hyperion. 

One big plus about The Fall of Hyperion is that there aren‚Äôt any vapid sex scenes, probably because Dan didn‚Äôt have any time to cram those in there. I kid lol. 

My favorite part of this book is without a doubt the lore that‚Äôs revealed. The first book has you grasping at straws and thrown for a gigantic loop with all the concepts it hands you. While that‚Äôs all fun and good, I think that those co costs are given actual live within The Fall of Hyperion. The whole hidden AI conspiracy plot was so goddam cool. I‚Äôm curious whether or not Terminator 2: Judgement Day took some inspiration from this, because the plots are nearly identical. Albeit I think Hyperion‚Äôs is way better. 

As I said previously, I think the Shrike is even more terrifying once you find out what it actually is. I also love how the book plays with the concept of time without feeling like a convoluted mess. The Ousters are badass, period. I love how the books subvert your expectations by revealing this faction to be incredibly advanced, almost beyond understanding. While the hegemony stagnates, the ousters excelled. 

The execution of the whole farcaster shutdown was phenomenal. It‚Äôs bittersweet, but tragic at the same time. Instead of forcing you to feel one specific emotion, the author instead asks you what you personally want to feel about it. Dan Simmons at his best. 

In short, The Fall of Hyperion is an answer to all of the questions Hyperion makes you ask. And it does so more than well.",books,1830

""Why do you want to spend time reading apart from me? Don't you want to talk to me? Don't you love me?""

""Why do you always have your nose stuck in a book instead of experiencing real life?""

It's like reading for fun is something you're only supposed to do when you're in elementary school. Once you master it, you're only supposed to read for school or to get ahead in your job.

"Don't get me wrong, i appreciate Orwell's commentary on censorship, but something about the novel just doesn't sit right with me. I felt like i already knew the moral of the book right from chapter 1, and everything just felt a little *obvious.* Not in terms of plot, although i felt that to be quite slow as well, but in terms of the writing style and symbolism lacking subtlety. (I've got to say though, the last chapter redeemed the book such that i felt like i hadn't wasted my time, it was very tragic and poignent, but i still think the rest of the book was not subtle enough.) 

I don't mean to come at Orwell, but i can't help feel this way.",books,649
" 

A little background story for why this book is so important to me: 

6 years ago, I lived on main street in my hometown. I was just a 10 minute walk away from the local book store. Being the girl whose head was always stuck in a book, I would walk there frequently, giving all my money to this independent book store. I got to know the owner pretty quickly. It was my senior year of high school, so we talked a lot about how I was moving away from my hometown of 18 years. The last day I was in town, I visited the bookstore. The owner said ""I have something I want to give you"" and she pulled this short, little fantasy book off the shelf. 

It always meant so much to me that she did that. I had made a connection and this book was the manifestation. I will never forget this. 

And you know what, I went to visit this book store a year later and she no longer remembered me. Keep this story in mind while I talk about the actual book now--

I loved this fantasy book. This time I read it 6 years after my first reread. Funny enough, it was EXACTLY 6 years after my first time. September 19th, 2014 I finished it the first time, and September 19th, 2020, I finished for the 2nd time. 

I always forget how quick this book is. It's short, and self-contained. What I really enjoy about the book itself is the fantasy rules--nothing is explained and nothing has to be. The world just exists, and it's perfect being told from the mind of the 7 year old. He is experiencing this world the same way we are. It's new and you just have to go along for the ride. 

Speaking of the narrator, I feel like so many of us can connect to him. He's a boy whose world is full of books. While he doesn't have a bad life, it seems like he has trouble fully connecting with people, until Lettie Hempstock. 

I absolutely ADORE the Hempstock family. They are the grandmothers everyone wishes they had. They are strong and confident. They are always there when you need them most. I honestly would love to live on their farm. This connection with Lettie finally lets us see a little more into the mind of our narrator. He finally has someone who will just let him be himself. He was able to grow just a little. That is, until, Lettie is taken away from him.

This book left me with a heartbroken, melancholic feeling. The narrator will never truly remember Lettie and what she did. He will never be able to experience a full life because of the hole still left in his heart. The events of the book were seemingly random chaos that just happened to descend upon him. Even when he comes back to the funeral that frames the events of this book, he only remembers a couple things when on the Hempstock's farm--but then quickly forgets. 

Because of my own background with this book, this hit even harder. The owner of my hometown's bookstore didn't remember me. Couldn't remember how important her and her store was for me in a pivotal moment in my life. I don't know--maybe a Hempstock snipped time and sewed it back together. 

All I know is, time is fragile. Memory is weak, and people are amazing.",books,3080
"I'll start off by saying that even though this is my first time *finishing* the book, it is not my first time reading it. I have gotten a little over half way through it on several occasions before (I tend to do that with books). The reason I've come back to it time and time again is that it continues to inspire me everytime I pick it up. This time around, I started with the audiobook on Audible (the recording by Andrew McMillan is amazing) and by the time I got about halfway through it again I had to go out an buy the physical copy to read alongside it. That's how useful this book is to me. Just like Carnegie's *How to Win Friends and Influence People*, this is a book you should come back to many times over and study to really feel the effects. It sits on my bedside table.

This book does not tell you anything you haven't heard before. However, it serves as a reminder to internalize certain principles into your daily existence in order to eliminate worrying and anxiety from your life. More than anything, it is just a handbook you can use to remind yourself to stop worrying, and it provides some quick fixes that can be used long term to allow you to do that. 

Have any of you had any experience with this book in particular or any other Dale Carnegie books for that matter? If so, what principles stuck with you and do you use any of them?

"I have very mixed feelings about this book. I mean the book itself is a very mixed bag. There were some moments were Dan‚Äôs talent as a writer really shines through, and others were I considered dropping the book altogether. I‚Äôll start with what I disliked first. 

The concept is unoriginal and not executed very well. A gang of kids team up to fight an evil supernatural force. The Bike Patrol acts like a discount Loser‚Äôs Club, only issue is that the maim cast in this book is nowhere near as interesting as those in Stephen King‚Äôs IT. Dwayne and Dale were fine, but the others were completely forgettable. I don‚Äôt even remember one of their names lol. I also didn‚Äôt find the monsters of the monsters scary in the slightest. The soldier was terrifying, which makes me wish that the plot centered around him. But everything else was just generic zombie crap. 

I enjoyed the interactions between the kids, especially the dialogue between Dale and his brother Lawrence. They‚Äôre the only two characters in the book besides Dwayne who get a decent amount of characterization. I also *really* liked father Kavanaugh for how little he actually shows up. The little character quirks and weird traditions the kids have help establish that they‚Äôve known each other for years before the story, and I think that helps out a lot with some of the emotional payoff you get towards the book‚Äôs mid section. 

There was only one scene in this book that I can say I just flat out hated. I didn‚Äôt like the sewer orgy in IT, so you bet your ass I wasn‚Äôt ok with what happened during the birthday party chapter. It was completely unnecessary. I‚Äôm gonna be a little biased here because I don‚Äôt like romance in any form of media, even though this shit ain‚Äôt romance. It‚Äôs just disgusting, and feels way out of place.",books,1795
"I‚Äôm trying to read more of the sci fi genre, as the only books I‚Äôve really read for the last 5 or so years were all horror. Hyperion was the first book I decided to read. It was recommended to me by a friend and plus I was familiar with the author before reading. Out of the 2 first books this one was definitely my favorite. 

My favorite aspect of Hyperion is that there are no exposition dumps. Considering the complex plot, that couldn‚Äôt have been easy to pull off. At first it seems like a barrage of different names and concepts,  it at you keep reading you are sponges more information about these things. The books takes time to build its world, and as a result it becomes more and more enjoyable because the world of Hyperion feels more alive. 

The Shrike is a great villain all throughout. As I mentioned earlier the Shrike has a very minimal presence. The one thing the book hammers into your mind from the get-go is those eyes. I always pictured this impossibly bright red glow that you lose yourself in when you stare into it. Usually I‚Äôm left disappointed when the monster receives a lot of backstory, but that wasn‚Äôt the case. Its origins were so damn cool and made the monster even better than it was at the start. 

Every single one of the pilgrims - besides the Templar - was amazing. Each is unique and feels like they come from completely different genres, which makes it all the more entertaining when their personalities and ideals come to blows. If I had to pick a favorite out of the bunch, it would probably be The Consul. 

My biggest gripe with this book is the ridiculous amount of sex scenes. Does Dan Simmons just get really horny when he writes? I wouldn‚Äôt have an issue if he was more subtle with these scenes, but a lot of them come off as neckbeard-ish. People don‚Äôt just take one look at each other and decide ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs do it‚Äù right there on the spot. Humans don‚Äôt work that way, and it‚Äôs annoying that stuff like this seems to replace actual character driven moments. Hence why I want a big fan of the Soldier‚Äôs tale.",books,2051

‚ÄúNot that, like a magic scene, it all opened upon me at once: the information I had obtained was of a nature rather to direct my endeavours so soon as I should point them towards the object of my search than to exhibit that object already accomplished. I was like the Arabian who had been buried with the dead and found a passage to life, aided only by one glimmering and seemingly ineffectual light.‚Äù 

My interpretation is that research that Victor compiled was still early enough to inform his pursuit in re-animating a lifeless object, rather than prove that he could already do so. This points to him saying that his research is still akin to a ‚Äúglimmering‚Äù and ‚Äúineffectual‚Äù light, not a strong and confident one. 

Is this the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù interpretation?

"Ok, so initially, I read this series because I saw it in a book list and I was curious about it. So I started reading, and one of the first things I noticed is that, despite it being YA, it is VERY ""Adult"" (in the ""teen watched porn for the first time in thier life"" sense of the word). While nothing sexually explicit happens, there's so much ""sex this"" and ""sex that"" that I wouldn't be surprised if it was secretly written for a adult audience. I sure as hell wouldn't give it to a 14 year old.


Anyways, moving on. As I was reading the first book, I was reminded of Vampire Academy, except it was much better, more ""kinder"" in a way, at least in the first book. By that, I mean, while yes, they are vampires, they aren't beholden by thier thirst, and can be just as kind as the next person, which I loved. Not only that, but the Goddess they worship truly is a loving goddess and you just aren't told that, you are shown that. While yes, there are cruel vampires, they get thier just desserts, and honestly, I really love the first book, because it shows that just because you're a vampire, doesn't mean you can't be a kind and compassionate person.

Then the second book happened. Then It all went to shit. See, in the first book, you learn that when you are ""marked"" by a vampire, you go through a 4 year period called ""The Change"", and not everyone makes it through The Change, because your body can reject it and if it does, you die (Personally, I think this is needlessly cruel because it means, to me, that you that became a vampire though sheer luck, and not though your own ability). See, in the book, the protagonist's best friend rejects the change and dies (right after she learns that she has a special affinity for earth, which is disgustingly cruel to me). However, apparently, you can live through this rejection, but if you do, you get changed into what can only be called a revenant (you are first shown this in the first book).


Why that is, I don't know. But apparently, the Main character's mentor, a kind, nurturing, understanding, and loving vampire is revealed to be evil and is actively using the revenant for some unknown reason (the fact that there is absolutely NO foreshadowing to this, outside of one line in the first book by the goddess, is like a absolute slap to the face to me, never mind how I really liked the character). Not only that, but thier is a really bad love SQUARE with the Main character and three men. Normally, I would tolerate love triangles, but this is going a step far. Now only that, but two of the men want the Protagonist for really bad reasons. One wants the MC because she had drunk his blood and she had ""imprinted"" on him, basically making him crazy for her only because she dunk some blood. And the second one is a 22 year old vampire who is just simply fascinated by her and only wants her because he's curious.


The bad part of it is that, in the third book, she thinks it's ok to CHEAT on her boyfriend with said 22 year old because he makes her feel like a woman. At this point, I'm pretty much done with this series, because this stupidity is getting too painful for me to read.",books,3151
"I'm not a big reader. I always struggle to find something that holds my interest. On a whim I decided to pick up Dune, since it's highly acclaimed and I can be fond of science fiction.  But I'm not even three pages in and I've already come across 20+ names and terms that mean nothing to me and I already feel overwhelmed. Am I going to be able to enjoy the story if I don't memorize them all? 

Maybe it's just my own preference, but I always prefer it when people and places are mentioned as they become relevant to the story. After all, why mention something if it's not important for the reader to learn of it yet? I've dabbled in writing my own stories and most of the literature I've read on the craft suggest to only supply the reader with information as its necessary. But yet I see so many books do the contrary. 

I want to enjoy this story, but I can't help but feeling discouraged already.",books,901
Good afternoon! Recently I have been reading the book ‚Äú Touching the Rock. ‚Äú A story about blindness and the changes that come with it. I have a list of class discussion questions and I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôve waited until last minute. I was wondering if anyone has read this book and wanted to just gently guide me in the right direction..... a Good Samaritan looking to help out someone in need!

"about a while ago, i posted about John Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath.  I really thought that it was ,,it''. but damn, East of Eden is like different dimension. What a quality. i am sure it's not like culmination triumph. i will think this way forever. THIS BOOK SHOULD BE NEXT TO CLASSICS IN BOOKSHELF like Anna Karenina, Les Miserables and so on. I am not really a pro in American Literature, but i am not a  *dilettante* either. This book might be the most so called Classic piece of American Literature. 

About plot itself, this plot totally changed my perception about how wrong i was approaching to people generally. and mostly, it reminded me that in everyone there's at least a single, small detail which is enough for us to love them as a person.

And Yeah, Timshel. &lt;- this whole finding about how it is about YOU CAN, and everything can be helped and nothing is late. i was just wow. Steinbeck jumped from decent writer to ONE OF THE GREATESTS, i can tell.

Just read the book, especially if you are from USA. i am not even American, but who cares. This is instant CLASSIC

P.S i reread the ending part 5th time, still tears to my eyes. STRONGLY DEVELOPED CHARACTERS, MAKE YOU CRY. And by the way Lee is probably most likeable character to me in literature",books,1268

Couple things I wanted to dig into more. What was the moon to Ursula? I understood the darkness, but the moon really sent her. 

Also, the horses at the end. What were they representing?

"I realised that horror as a genre is seen as relatively repetitive and full of uncomfortable jump scares that don't fully reveal the shocking character who is being foreboded from the beginning. I was always interested in horror, and I have seen my share of supernatural, PG-13, thriller, psychological from the western influence. My search for a well conceptualised horror story continued.. sub-consciously. 

What I was looking for was simple terror. 

I was finally  introduced to Junji Itou by the book named ""Uzumaki"". A manga that is simply about a town that is haunted by spirals. 

Now, read that again and answer this, how many things around you go about in spirals? 

\*Takes a breath and slowing exhales\* 

The perspective around horror is a singular genre, but to be very honest there is nothing that is one dimensional when it comes to producing art. Every author has his/her/ their own brand and their own personal take on what they find terrifying. Horror refers to the commodification of fear, now fear can be anything not just the supernatural, like being faced by a natural predator, having your body going against you, an obsession growing out of control or being caught having sex in a conservative household. 

In short, I think fear is instigated in the viewer when you make them alert of their surroundings. Have you ever been extra receptive to sounds, after seeing a horror movie? 

While reading the manga I couldn't stop myself slipping into a sort of obsession, the manga made me very aware where the spirals occur around me,  like I'd see them in swirling water or when I studied the technicalities involved in graphic designing and art. To think that something like a spiral haunting the town, is uncomfortably eerie. It is the kind of manga that will reach inside your skin and tickle your nerves. You'll laugh and be worried at the same time. What kind of an emotion is that? I even wore spiral earrings to my meetings with clients hoping they would slip into a trans like state looking at them, but then thats just me being silly.. \*haha\*!

Junji is of course an amazing artist, he is able to put so much depth into each panel and piece he makes, making the viewer go beyond being scared, but also amazed by what is being portrayed. The book has very interesting and grotesque art that completely blew my mind. I realised that there a style when it comes to horror or tragedy based comics, is to go slow and immerse yourself in the amazing details of each manga. How each artist tries to express himself through his imagery and simple storylines. 

Another artist that I have grown to love is Shuuzou Oshimi, who uses silence to create eeriness, he very skilled when it comes to drawing human anatomy and is able to produce absolutely amazing pieces of art by bringing out the vulnerability and fragility of human emotion. His mangas are usually centred around teenagers who go through difficult situations and being unable to voice those pains with anyone, internalising all these emotions to bring out more violent forms of themselves. 

I even read a manga called ""Metamorphosis"" or ""Emergence"" which is originally in the hentai category but the story is something that really scares you, the situations the protagonist is put in and the visual imagery makes you very uncomfortable, stirring fear in the reader of the unexpected turns in life and how unprepared one can be to take on these situations. I believe this is completely different realm of cultivating fear, which can and is used as a means to portray realistic circumstances and shed light on topic like abuse, domestic violence, to try and make people aware of these demons that exist in our society. 

Horror has helped me connect to a part of myself that I wasn't sure even existed. It has made me see the darkness through the characters in the story, by looking beyond the fact that its a fictional character but looking at the story as a part of the artists consciousness and feelings. 

I encourage people to find dark mangas like Uzumaki, Chi No Wadachi, Aku No Hana, Metamorphosis and Tomie.",books,4099
"‚ÄúTo the non-combatants and those on the periphery of action, the war meant only boredom or occasional excitement, but to those who entered the meat grinder itself the war was a netherworld of horror from which escape seemed less and less likely as casualties mounted and the fighting dragged on and on. Time had no meaning, life had no meaning. The fierce struggle for survival in the abyss of Peleliu had eroded the veneer of civilization and made savages of us all.‚Äù",books,468
"Acayib-ul mahlukat: It is one of the most interesting books in the world. There are several picture(miniature),and expression.

If you want to more information you can look Encyclopedia of Islam.",books,385
"I've been a big anime and pro wrestling fan and just recently made the dive into book reading. I just caught up with stormlight archive and have come to find the elements that ties my favorite of all mediums together. I found I really love action scenes driven with strong emotional weight. I could care less for action that's just cool stuff or simple life and death. I much prefer action and combat that is used for to show character development and internal conflicts. for what ever reason the juxtaposition of brutal fighting with deep meaning just gets me going. I found Brandon Sanderson does this a lot, anime like hajime no ippo and vinland saga, and classic wrestling like Dusty Rhodes pull this off consistently.

I generally like sci fi/fantasy with hard magic systems, but what would you reccomend for books that pull of this type of action?",books,853
"I loved reading francis of the filth by George Miller.Although it may lack proper grammar and spelling in some parts, the world which George has created is so intriguing that i couldn't put the book down. Its the reason why I started reading and writing so much. Has anyone else read it? If so, what were your thoughts?",books,319
"I don't really read much books. To be honest I read almost no books (1-3 a year) and I want to change that because there are so much good and fun stories out there which I don't know yet.

My favorite book is Ready Player One and I am looking for something in that direction (cyberpunk, dystopia) but I also like scifi and spy stories. And if its possible the book shouldn't that long.

"After finally watching  the Soviet produced War and Peace (as I also finally gotten around reading the book last month), I rewatched the Audrey Hepburn War and Peace.

Despite now seeing how its a typical Holllywoodized book to film transition and cuts out so much and changes even more as to insult Tolstoy in his grave, I really enjoyed it still. I have always rewatched War and Peace since childhood along with Breakfast at Tiffany's, Roman Holliday, and Funny Faces. Because I LOVE LOVE LOVE Audrey Hepburn and while I only finally gotten around seeing the rest of her resume this year, it was a joy in my attempt to watch every film she ever starred in in a non-stop marathon to watch her in War and Peace even if the script makes Natasha so different from the original book.

So do any of you do the same thing? What are some examples?",books,841
"I got into reading as a pastime last year and there's one problem I encounter with a lot of books. Every few pages, or sometimes multiple times on one page I have to open up Google, type in a word and look up a definition, then copy that definition to a notebook so that I can look over it later for it to stick. It disrupts the whole flow of the story a bit, and usually about halfway through I get frustrated and stop doing that altogether and just read.

Is there an app that simplifies this process? One where you just open the app, aim the camera, tap on the word and the rest is done for you?",books,598
" I have been a huge Tolstoy fan ever since reading War and Peace for an AP English class in High School. Since then, I have gradually read through all of Tolstoy's books. I was amazed to discover that in his later life he actually wrote a few books on radical, Christian Theology. In his last years he became outspoken against the Russian church and the aristocracy. He advocated for obedience to the teachings of Jesus and a life of poverty. These two books - A Confession and What I Believe are his relatively unknown theological masterpieces. His thoughts on Jesus and the Sermon on The Mount were ahead of his time. I highly encourage every Tolstoy fan to check these out!",books,676
"Ready Player One is the kind of bad that's like touching a hot stove: it hurts a lot up front but the real pain comes as the pain sits and throbs with you. It's the kind of book that gets worse the longer you think about it but I didn't hate it.

This book is a 13 year old geek's ultimate escapist fantasy. It's a world where you're encyclopedic knowledge of nerd culture gains you clout, a world where the hot popular girls do give you a chance to show them what a ""nice guy you are"" and it's a world where corporations are so nakedly evil that they actually kill people but can be dismantled overnight through a ragtag team of idyllic youths. Any of these alone is pretty eye-roll worthy but all of them in conjuction with our edgy atheist, L33t hacker gentle-sir protag Wade Watts taking the helm shows a disturbing lack of self-awarness from the writer.

When talking about this book, you can't run away from talking about the pop culture references and as someone who was not born in the 80s, most of it was completely unintelligible gibberish. There was this kind of manipulative vibe I got from the book where there was an involuntary flash of excitement when I did recognize something but when there was something I knew, it became quickly apparent there was probably very little rhyme or reason to their inclusion. With such a wealth of great material the author pulls from, Papa Ernest never really has much of interesting to say about any of it, proudly displaying something to the audience and then quickly moving onto the next reference.

Despite all that, there were moments where I was able to turn off my brain and appreciate some of the good stuff this book had to offer. I'd imagine that the movie adaptation is probably more fun than this if for nothing else to see the visual spectacle of what this VR world would look like.",books,1845
"So I am an avid reader, grew up reading the classics and mostly fiction, branched out to other genres later. And now continue to read diverse genres that include fiction and non-fiction. For me books are like any other piece of art - can be appreciated just for the sheer pleasure of consuming it. And ofcourse you learn to stand in someone's shoes, learn about diverse topics..etc..

So my question is: why is there a big debate on what is better? Or is it just people around me? (I do work in corporate so I am surrounded by people with business degrees, but hey I am one of them too and I can read a finance book just as well as reading a literature piece)

I have co-workers who read only non-fiction come up to me and tell me how fiction is not that useful as you don't learn much. And ask me why I waste time on these things? And there are other circles who sort of hold this view too. And I have sort of encountered this over many years across different geographies where I have lived- so it is not a specific Asian, US or European thing.

Why do I have keep defending fiction? (I know I don't have to, I read what I read and shouldn't care what these people think). But for my understanding, why is there such a divide. And tbh most of the people criticising fiction are men. So whats really going on here? Why this disdain for books? 

I am glad more people are reading but why is there such a criticism of certain genres?",books,1431
"I've loved reading as far as I can remember and I've never really had trouble focusing on a written story. but every single time I pick up a classic, the outdated language puts me off, the big words give me a headache and the style seems very drab and boring to me. I'm very disappointed with myself having never even tried to read jane austen or dickens although i really want to. I read girl woman other recently by bernardine and i read it in a day because it was relatable and consuming, and that's probably because its relevant and contemporary. How do I do the same with classics, how do I find classics that I can relate to , in order to make the reading experience better and what are some reasons why you read classics?",books,728

"A few months ago in picked up ""Leadership"" by Doris Goodwin. I thoroughly enjoyed the book but felt I was making painfully slow progress - after a few months I wasn't even halfway through. On top of that, my Kindle told me I had 18 hours left of reading. Discouraged, I put it aside and moved onto other things. 

I recently saw it in my library and decided to open it back up and give it a shot. I accidentally jumped to the last page and started scrolling back to where i was. To my dismay, the last 54% of the books are notes and citations! I checked and am really only about 60 pages away from the end - a few days worth of reading for me.

"I've been on a terrorist binge this year, reading a whole lot of books with terrorism as a main topic or extremist characters, but I hadn't yet read anything from India so I decided to give *A Burning* a try. I was a bit hesitant going in from seeing the popularity of this book, popular books can sometimes be a flop, but I was proved wrong, this book is fantastic. Every character has a proper storyline, we even get a glimpse into the thoughts and lives of minor characters every now and then, and they feel like real people. Really good book!",books,546
"This book was a fiction novel, and the main character was assigned to some kind of mission or a task, And during the process of trying to complete what he needed to, he ended up seeking help for meditation, and the person teaching him taught him about a method where he should empty his head except for one image of a candle, and try to have that candle be the only thing in his head for a certain amount of time.

He fails a lot at first, but eventually he manages to complete this task.

I read this book sometime in the early 2010's I believe, but do not put too much weight on that.",books,586
"Hello! So my knowledge of Les Mis is very limited, I have seen/heard practically nothing of the musical and movie and I've only just cracked open the book a few days ago. At the moment, I have finished the first two books in Fantine and I'm about to start the third. 

I enjoy the social commentary and especially the moments with Jean Valjean, but overall the story is quite dry and slow. While I've enjoyed the story thus far, I've only been reading this far because of the hope that it's all buildup to a far greater story. Does it get better from book 2? Or should I find another story to fill my time if it hasn't captivated me in the first 112 pages?",books,656
"One of my old lecturers in history wrote a an original course called The Global Crisis, that gives context to the modern contemporary human dilemma in ways that far surpass even the works of the admirable Yuval Noah Harari (of whom I'm a big fan).

It's taken me 8 years to convince this Oxford-learned lecturer to write the book - because he's hugely pessimistic about it; ""who on earth would want to read a book on the fate that awaits humans""? Well for starters, I WOULD. In fact, even the famed Noam Chomsky has approved this guy's works as legitimate &amp; whilst all academically referenced, his works are still very original. 

His works give context to our modern ills in ways that I've never before witnessed. Just yesterday, due to my persistence, he agreed to write a draft of the book, ready for December.

My question is - do any of you have advice for how to best approach this material, and how to 'sell' the idea to publishers? Do I first test the reception via a blog (or via Medium), or how best to approach it? I'm a producer with Red Bull, so book publishing &amp; development are not my forte, but I MUST see this particular book come to light. 

See a very broad abstract in the comments below. Thanks for all your kind help.",books,1247
"Wow! What a fantastic read! The story and the social commentary was impressive, but what I really loved about the book was the way it was written. The descriptive style is so wonderful that at times, I could almost feel the heat and cold in East Egg/West Egg. It felt good to be enchanted by a book after a long time.",books,317
"I know a lot of literature majors and other book lovers that adore the feel of a regular book, but I don't quite get the appeal. The best counterarguments to Ebooks I have heard are ""It doesn't run out of charge,"" ""Not all people have electronics to read from,"" and ""If the internet goes down these copies are all that will be left."" I will concede the point that physical copies of books are more accessible for a lot of people, and that's something I think is wonderful, but for the purpose of whether online books or physical books are better, consider that a person has equal access to both. As for charge and an apocalypse, one is avoidable and with the other, well, we would have bigger issues to worry about than how to read our online books.   


My points in favor of online books are:  
\-Customizable font, brightness, and page color  
\-Easier to transport and hold  
\-Many allow for dictionary integration, helping readers learn words  
\-Highlight, comment, annotate, and Ctr+F to sort all your favorite quotes  


Ebooks or Physical copies? Does anyone believe that physical books are superior?",books,1110
"This was a 15th century English novel, a collection of the Arthurian legends translated from the French into English prose by a knight-prisoner named Thomas Malory. It involves the mythical King Arthur, Guinevere, Lancelot, Tristrain and Isolde, Merlin, and the Round table knights and the quest for the Holy grail. 

I found it extremely boring for the first like 600 pages when it was talking about Arthur and the Round table and the knights jousting with each-other at useless tournaments every three seconds. The writing style, however, was sparse and sort of pointy, but in a good way. I think it‚Äôs very well written. Once it starts to talk about the quest for the Holy Grail (around pg 600) it got way more interesting, and stayed that way until the end, where it was really, really good (I read the last 100 pages in one sitting). 

If it just didn‚Äôt have all the needless tournaments and battles in the first half, it would be almost a perfect novel. It‚Äôs too bad that ruins it and probably puts people off from finishing it, or getting to the point with the Holy Grail where it gets really good. 

I thought it would be promoting the idea of chivalry and knighthood but it ended up actually criticizing those ideas, and had a very strong Christian-ascetic message of giving up everything earthly and just living as a monk. That‚Äôs what the most heroic knight (Lancelot) did after his pride and ego basically caused everyone to die. So that message was surprising. 

Plus, if you‚Äôre into fantasy-plots and elements like that, there‚Äôs a lot of gold in this book. Lake-fairies, mythical beasts, dragons, wizards, witches, etc all make appearances, although they are, in the end, overshadowed by the strong Christian bent the novel has. 

So I would give this book a 7/10. It‚Äôs considered a classic, but judging from I‚Äôve read, most people find it a slog at times. Again, the last 1/3rd was amazing; I‚Äôm just not sure it was amazing enough to redeem the first 2/3rds, though.",books,1979
"Finished reading it recently and loved it. Such a strangely haunting story that I haven't been able to get out of my head. The prose is absolutely gorgeous, and the atmosphere Donna Tartt creates of autumnal Vermont is incredible - nostalgic, melancholy and dreamlike. The characters are what really drive this story and all the main cast were fascinating, especially Henry and Bunny. None of them are particularly likable people, but they are fascinating, layered and oddly sympathetic in their own way.

It's really compelling to see the path that leads to Bunny's murder and the subsequent fallout - these kids, essentially, who are so detached from real life and live every day like it's some heightened, stylized literary reality, and are not ready for the consequences of their actions. In between, there is genuinely a sense of longing and loneliness and wanting to be part of something greater.

The ending hit me hard too - like Richard, I had gotten really attached to these characters for all their flaws and dysfunctions. Seeing that little group break apart and dissolve into nothing was aching. 

Book isn't perfect though - the pacing is a little wonky at times and the final 25% after bunny's body is discovered is a bit of a bore. But otherwise, it's a fantastic book. Highly recommended.",books,1305
"So, I just recently remembered this book my teacher showed the class I was in way back in elementary school. I've been trying to remember the name of it but can't remember what it was called no matter how hard I try.

My teacher described it as a very mysterious book. The author was written on the front of the book but was unknown as to who that person actually was. It was like they didn't exist. No one knew what they looked like. The book was a collection of short stories. Each of them were sort of scary (I think?). The only one I really remember was this short story about these dust bunnies. They would collect under the couch and was hostile towards people (I think). I might be remembering something wrong but I could've sworn it ended with the dust bunnies eating the people in the house it was living in. 

The book had some pictures in it which makes me think it was a kids book. I'm probably not doing a good job at describing it but that's the most amount of detail I can remember. Any suggestions as to what book this was would be much appreciated!",books,1065
"Hello all, I am not a member of this sub, so I apologize if this question is a bit odd. I am looking into purchasing a copy of ‚ÄúMeditations‚Äù as a gift for someone.

"In this book I found a GOLD MINE of foundational knowledge that just about every person could use. The tool-kit building guide and myriad 50 year old but-still-relevant home repair and renovation projects make for an engaging page turner. Yes, an instruction manual that's a page-turner!

A deep dive into the genre shows that there are maybe 3 to 5 all-encompassing books like it, and they're on updated every 10 years or so. The last such book of any kind was the Family Handyman's complete diy guide, published in 2016. Such a tragedy. . . These things should be updated like textbooks!

"This is a bit of an odd question, but does anyone have any tips on how to unquantify my general reading schedule? Around January this year, I set a goal for myself to read 100 pages a day. This worked well at first, as it was a pretty novel gimmick to be able to finish a book in a couple days, but I soon found myself becoming really stressed by the goal, despite the fact that I enjoyed the books I read. This continued up until about two weeks ago, and in that time I've read a lot of amazing books, but I think I've lost a fair bit of enjoyment directly because of the goal I've put upon myself. So far, I've finished three books in the time since I let go of my 100 pages goal and enjoyed all of them a good bit. Despite this, however, I still find myself feeling weird and off when I don't meet the goal that I officially no longer adhere to. On a surface level I really don't care how many books I read (besides my impatience to get to all of the amazing books out there!) as long as I enjoy them, but on a more subconscious level I still feel like shit when I only read 70 or 80 out of my previous daily 100 pages. 

So, fellow readers, do you have any tips for how I can unbreak my book-brain? One thought I had was that I could get more e-books and turn off the page feature so I can just read as long as I want to without thinking about it, and I'll probably try this in the future. Thanks in advance for all of your responses!",books,1438
"I used to be a voracious reader. A book a day-week depending on the book. Now aside reading for work (usually abstracts or data from scientific papers) or posts on social media, I haven't done any real reading in maybe 3-4 years.

I bought a book recently and now I am finding I drift off after a few lines and have to re-read because I'm just not taking it in. I seem to have only about 10% (if I'm being generous to myself) of the concentration I used to have

Social media can be fun, but I find it is ruining the pleasure of reading for fun or to learn something else. Any why read when a YouTube video can tell you?

" ""Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI"" by David Grann has all the tropes of the True Crime drama: a murder, the investigation, the trial, and conspiracy. It is as gripping as any murder mystery, but it is heartbreaking as well. The Osage murders are a microcosm of the atrocities that white men have inflicted on Native Americans to take what is theirs throughout American history. The Osage's struggle for justice will have you asking, ""How can they let them do this?"" That frustration is balanced by former Texas Ranger Tom White who puts together an undercover team to investigate the crimes. As we follow his investigation, we see the vision that J. Edgar Hoover has for his FBI and how he uses this case to help craft it. Highly recommended to all fans of true crime, history buffs, and anyone interested in Native American culture.",books,872

Here is a list of underrated shows/films that I think did justice to the books they were adapted from. (Will try to include most genres) 

1. Good Omens - Listen, the blasphemous,witty, crazy and sarcastic combination of the writers named Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman gave us this gem of a book. Extremely hilarious moments from the book adequately incorporated into the series (available in amazon prime) were due to made the best casting of David Tennant and Micheal Sheen in the leads. The unexpected age-old friendship of an angel and a demon couldnot have been portrayed by anyone better them. 
The book was a 9/10. The series was a solid 8/10. Much of the book and the series were aligned with one another except the towards ending. 
2.  Girl, interrupted - Now this was a book vastly different from the movie although key points were taken from the book. Both the book and the movie are equally amazing. The movie starts exactly how it is depicted in the movie. 
This movie has some epic actors in it with Angelina Jolie, Winona Ryder, Brittney Murphy, Jared Leto to name a few. 
The movie is set in a mental asylum where the writer (played by Winona) ends up due to an attempted suicide when she was 18 and for once I felt the movie was better than the book but that‚Äôs just me because I felt the book became to analytical towards the end. 
It‚Äôs a beautiful movie. (8/10) 
And a good read. (7/10) 
3. Me before you - while writing the manuscript, Jojo Moyes probably knew  that it would pull audiences in the theatres if made into a movie. To top it off, Emilia Clarke, Charles Dance, Janet McTeer Sam Claflin and Mathew Lewis (Yes our Neville had a glow up here) were cast in the main leads.
Louisa Clark is a cracker for a woman who had an eccentic sense of style who was forced to look for a job and ended up caring for a man who is paralysed from the neck down. Love doesn‚Äôt have a timing, you see, when it hits, it hits hard. The movie or the book doesn‚Äôt end like it should and that‚Äôs what makes it special. 
Both the book and the series get a solid 7/10 from me. 
4. Unorthodox - Another book that has some extreme differences with the plot of the series. The series is in netflix and has the same name. 
This book opened me to a world I had no idea about, the closed off, secluded world of Hasidic Judaism. The world are women and men (esp women) were not meant to know even about their own bodie, sexual education toh dure thak. A world where women aren‚Äôt meant to be too educated, so similar that world is to what we see happening in parts of our own country. 
The series is dramatised but the book is a memoir about finding freedom from a more realistic perspective. 
Book- 8/10, series - 7/10",books,2715
"I'm not going to name specific authors because I don't want this to turn into an argument. But I'm developing this tendency to judge writers not on how much I enjoy something they've written, but by other factors. A few examples: I liked a certain author, but then I learned that he had written another series that totally ruined him for me because of how frivolous and shallow it was. I then saw him in a series of interviews and, for reasons I won't specify, I was put off by him (ok, it was his choice in attire and how clearly he was proud of his physique.) 

Another writer was seen by an ex of mine in a coffee shop and he was acting like a total piece of shit. So nothing by him. 

Also, if a writer seems too young, too suburban, if it's a guy and he wears New Balance shoes and cargo pants, or else if I just can't get past their twitter feed, their opinions, their politics, or if they are too attractive (yeah, I know, stupid!), I just can't take them seriously.

I absolutely love reading, this is one of the few things that I am incredibly passionate about and couldn‚Äôt imagine my life without.

Now I'm not here to shower praise on the film itself, instead it has come to my attention that the movie is actually based on the novel goes by the same name.

"Good day,

&amp;#x200B;

I thought about starting Dune some time ago, but after some research i found out it is a complete universe. I was a little bit stunned by the size of this universe. I have got many, many other books on my list, so i would like to ask you: Is just the [first](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44767458-dune) book worth reading it, or is it a ""must"" to read all the other 17 (?) books to?

Would you [this](https://www.goodreads.com/questions/363445-i-really-want-to-read-the-novel-dune-i) is correct? Or how is your opinion to the rest of the dune universe?

Jorgenson and, of course,  the master-gunner Peyrol (to name just few of them).

"I read Dune a while back, and apart from the iconic worldbuilding elements, I mostly remember being rather underwhelmed.

With the movie coming up, I re-read the synopsis, some reviews, and it seems there's something at the core of this story that I can't get behind. But maybe I missed the nuance on my first read, which is why I'm making this post.

My issues with the book are this :

One, Paul &gt;!rises to become basically a religious dictator ruling over millions of lives.!&lt; And this is considered a good thing ? From what I remember, &gt;!the crowning achievement of the first book is him establishing an authoritarian regime that's not much better than the one just before, except he has mystical powers and is supposedly a good guy.!&lt; That message irks me a lot, but maybe I missed something fundamental about Herbert's view of religious fanaticism and governments ?

Two, I remember Paul as going through the hero's journey mostly unchallenged in his righteousness. He does have a share of humbling moments, but those are about skill and power moves more than they are about moral character. As a character, I don't remember him having to face significant guilt, shame, anxiety or any other moral failing that would allow him to evolve. I remember him as being haughty, dispassionate, and being rewarded for it. Does the Litany against fear really represent what this book thinks of emotions ? You repress them and you become a super-hero ?

Am I thoroughly mistaken in my memories of the book ? Did Herbert intend to give a very different takeaway from what I remember ?",books,1589

"One of the most pregnant cultural and religious symbols embodied in Julien Green's novels is that of **the stairs**. The author himself noticed, surprised, this small but significant detail in his journal. But, simultaneously, he emphasizes **the absolutely involuntary character of the presence of such a symbol in his writings**.

Actually, in the writings of all significant authors we can record such images and symbols encoded in the filigree of their creations. From Homer and Hesiod to Joseph Conrad and John Ronald Reuel Tolkien literature is full of such ""archetypes"" or ""paradigms"".

Scholars like Vladimir Yakovlevich Propp, Ioan Petru Culianu, Gilbert Durand, Emil Turdeanu, Northrop Frye and many others tried to explain the presence of the religious symbols in literary works.

"Winston Groom, a Southern writer who found a measure of belated celebrity when his 1986 novel, ‚ÄúForrest Gump,‚Äù was made into the 1994 [Oscar-winning film](https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/06/movies/film-review-tom-hanks-as-an-interloper-in-history.html) starring Tom Hanks, died on Thursday at his home in Fairhope, Ala. He was 77.

He died in his sleep, most likely from a heart attack, his stepson Frederick Helmsing said.

Mr. Groom had published three well-regarded novels and a nonfiction finalist for a Pulitzer Prize when he wrote the book that would define him as a writer and turn the Gumpian phrase ‚Äúlife is like a box of chocolates‚Äù into a modern-day proverb.

"In Orson Scott Card's sequel to Ender's Game, Speaker for the Dead, the reader is introduced to the idea of a Speaker: one who travels the cosmos from world to world speaking on behalf of the dead. 

These a-religious individuals draw inspiration from the celebrated book, The Hive Queen and The Hegemon. Authored by Andrew Wiggin under the pen name ""Speaker for the Dead"", The Hive Queen and The Hegemon transformed the public's perception on the Formics. Suddenly there was a new angle to look at things. The human race's first contact with other conscious beings ended with the foreign species destroyed in the blink of an eye all because of the inability to communicate with them. It wasn't, as many people thought, a last-stand defense against a nearly unstoppable evil. Once thought of as monsters, the Formics were now mourned. The one who committed the xenocide, once hailed a hero, was now the true evil.

When a Speaker speaks for the deceased, they try to first understand their full story. They learn about the deceased's role in society, their dreams and secrets, and who they loved and why. Then, they share with others who that individual was with full context, as if the dead themselves were speaking. Speaking is not an act of judgement; it is just pure understanding and empathy. While most Speakers can empathize with the dead, only the best can lead others, both strangers and those close to the deceased, to the same position of pure understanding and empathy.

I'm curious if someone in the current state of society plays a role like that. Maybe not a literal Speaker, but someone who can lead others to a point of full understanding and empathy for other people. It could be therapists, biographical authors, or even actors who play famous villains so well that the audience understands the motivations behind a monster. They might even empathize.

"So I've been trying to read Kristen Lavransdatter, and am having a hard time keeping at it. I'm sort of stuck in a cycle where I'll put the book down for months, then read a bit for a few days, and then forget about it for months again. I think the main issue is I'm not quite sure what kind of book I'm reading. I'm waiting for the plot to start, and have no idea when it will, or if it already has. Overall progress is slow. So far it feels like a romance novel that isn't trying to be super romantic.

Does the plot pick up at a point? As far as I know the book follows almost her entire life, so I'm thinking it might just be more a giant character study than even having a ""plot"" in the classical sense. Is that right? If it is I might wait until I can really devote an extended chunk of time to read it, since without a hook I'm finding it easy to forget about as soon as I put it down.

"Hello all!

I was reading the recent post of a Redditor who had just finished Liu Cixin's *The Three Body Problem*, and I felt compelled to start a parallel conversation about how cultural perspectives shape a story, specifically the characters, the plot, and underlying concepts.

**1. The Characters:**
I have seen numerous complaints, both in the aforementioned thread and in others over the years about how the character development is lacking in *The Three Body Problem* and its successors, or that they are simply not relatable.  To say this is to make the most basic, superficial assessment possible, and completely misses a very critical truth:  as a Chinese author, Liu Cixin's characters reflect certain values and ideas that are intrinsic to that culture,  which often do not align with a ""Western"" (or more specifically an *American*) perspective.  The characters lack the type of relatability and depth that many Western readers are accustomed to because in Chinese culture, the individual does not hold the same degree of importance.  More specifically, we must view the characters as parts of the whole, each of which has some small role to play that contributes to the advancement of their community, their family, etc. 
Many of the more prominent characters display a sort of resignation in the face of their strugges; they view their task as something that is innately part of life, and that their individual concerns and goals (if expressed at all) take a back seat to other objectives that benefit the collective.  I could come up with numerous examples of this but frankly I don't feel like spending the time, but if you look back, this principle is evident throughout the trilogy.

**2. The Plot: (POSSIBLE SPOILERS)**
In a very short period of time, China has evolved from a rustic country looking to establish itself in the 'modern world' to one of the most influential political and economic forces in the world.  The near obsession with progress is fundamental to the modern Chinese mindset, and it makes perfect sense that the author would focus so closely on pushing the narrative forward, even at the expense of character development or catering to the reader's more sentimental desires.  In the story, characters fall out of the plot (or are killed off) with little fanfare, the political climates shift rapidly, and some other plotlines are discarded without being fully completed.   All of these elements demonstrate the attitude that pushing the narrative forward takes absolute precedence, especially if the ultimate goal is showcasing the philosophical and moral concepts that anchor the books.

**3. The Concepts:**
*The Three Body Problem, The Dark Forest, and Death's End* are books that challenge the reader to digest and evaluate some very heavy scientific, philosophical, cultural, and even metaphysical concepts. in my opinion, the story is simply a vehicle to explore these grand and at times terrifying ideas in a fairly 'realistic' way.  No, the subjective experiences of each individual character are not that important when compared to many Western stories which often use a single person's experiences as a stage on which to display the author's ideas. As with the Chinese nation, Liu Cixin is focused on scientific advancement (and superiority), poise in the face of great adversity, and resilience despite the overwhelming calamities that the Trisolaran Crisis initiate in the world.  Ultimately, I feel that the author wants the reader to evaluate these very complex concepts and recognize that, whether we like it or not, there is a very real possibility that they may come to pass in the not so distant future.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
At the end of the day, as always, it is perfectly fine if you do not like this story, and I do not mean to blindly defend the author or the trilogy, although I did personally enjoy it a great deal.  I just want other readers out there to be mindful of cultural biases and how they can shape the way you evaluate a story, a character, or any of the ideas presented in a story.  Context is key, and keeping our minds open is critical to enjoying the best possible reading experience.

"The book is exactly what the title suggests: A Short History of Nearly Everything. Bill Bryson takes us on a long journey that starts with the event of singularity and ends on the dawn of 21st century; all the while covering important events in the history of our planet and of those extraordinary (and some ordinary) individuals thanks to whom we are now aware of such events.¬†

 

Bill Bryson covers everything from astrology to biology. All of you must have faced the following question or at least must have felt an itch of basic knowledge about our planet. How did the universe and the Earth came into being?¬†How do we know about infinite galaxies that we are surrounded in?¬†Ever wonder how did we come to know about the Earth's interior?¬† How has the process of evolution worked its way to a master race of intelligent beings? Why are Newton and Einstein still held in such high regard? How sure are we of our findings? All such questions will be answered in this books.¬†

&amp;#x200B;

The exceptional and unique quality about this book is that it is understandable for anyone with a non-scientific background. It surely helps that the author is occasionally funny and the text keeps the reader captivated. Consider the instance where he first informs the reader that lithosphere (crust and top part of outer mantle) floats on top of asthenosphere (small portion of upper mantle) but then immediately asks to not to visualize this flow in a normal sense of a material flowing on a surface. He adds, ""The hour hand on a clock moves about ten thousand times faster than the flowing rocks of the mantle"". Such examples and illustrations to enhance the comprehension of the reader are common throughout the book.  


Although the author tries his best to engage his audience at every point, the book might feel drab and slow during some chapters. There are some portions you might feel are redundant to talk about and some portions you wish author had expanded upon.¬†

  
Some people reviewing this book apparently have a problem with the author's excessive use of numbers; not realizing of course that all this is done for reader to comprehend things that are otherwise unimaginable. Saying Pluto is a very tiny planet would have been understandable on its own but adding that it is just 0.25% as massive as Earth really puts in perspective the minuteness of Pluto. Additionally, the author correctly pointed out at the beginning that terms like million years or billion years do not make much sense to us since we do not understand such large numbers. The author instead tries to use illustrations and examples to hit his point home. For example mentioning that the inner core has a temperature of 5200 degrees Celsius would allow reader to imagine the core as immensely hot but the interesting tidbit that the inner core has a temperature similar to Sun establishes the blistering temperature in the core in a more understandable way.

  
Some people have a problem that it isn't scientific enough. Perhaps they need to read the title again. And instead read the research papers and books referenced in the end. One of the main goals of the book is to clearly be understandable for a layman. That is the reason the author chose to skim over some concepts, he thought, would be hard to grasp. And also the reason there are interesting tidbits about the different discoverers and inventors that some felt were unnecessary.

  
Others dislike the apparently know-it-all attitude of the author. This is especially funny since the author has left no doubts that he makes no claims on his own. There is an almost 100 pages bibliography at the end. I am at a loss on imagining what such readers expected otherwise? Perhaps words like ""I think so"", ""In my view"", ""I am not sure about this but"" or maybe ""Don't take my word for it but"".¬†  
Anyways for those who don't have a problem with learning a little history about the planet we live, breathe and will most certainly die on, I highly recommend this book.   


P.S. I suggest keeping a highlighter handy while reading this book. Since this book is extremely informative, you might have forgotten most of it in a matter of weeks.

"Brothers, do not fear man‚Äôs sins. Love man in his sin too, for such love resembles God‚Äôs love, the highest possible form of love on earth. Love God‚Äôs creation, love every atom of it separately, and love it also as a whole; love every green leaf, every ray of God‚Äôs light; love the animals and the plants and love every inanimate object. If you come to love all things, you will perceive God‚Äôs mystery inherent in all things; once you have perceived it, you will understand it better and better every day. And finally you will love the whole world with a total, universal love. 

Love the animals: God has given them the beginnings of thought and untroubled joy. So do not disturb their joy, do not torment them, do not deprive them of their well-being, do not work against God‚Äôs intent. Man, do not pride yourself on your superiority to the animals, for they are without sin, while you, with all your greatness, you defile the earth wherever you appear and leave an ignoble trail behind you - and that is true, alas, for almost every one of us!

Above all, love little children, for they are sinless, like little angels, and they are there to arouse our tenderness, to purify our hearts, and in a sense to guide us. Woe to the man who offends a small child! ‚Ä¶

There will be moments when you will feel perplexed, especially in the presence of human sin. You will ask yourself: ‚ÄúMust I always combat it by force or try to overcome it by humble love?‚Äù Always choose humble love, always. Once you have chosen it, you will always have what you need to conquer the whole world. Loving humility is a powerful force, the most powerful, and there is nothing in the world to approach it. 

Every day, every hour, every moment, examine yourself closely and see that your appearance is seemly. You may, for instance, pass a small child; your face may be angry, you may be uttering wicked words, and there may be rage in your heart; you may not even notice the child, but as long as the child sees you in that state, that unseemly and ugly picture may become engraved in his innocent little heart. So, without knowing it yourself, you may thus have sown an evil seed, which perhaps will sprout within the child, and all simply because you failed to control yourself before the child, because you failed to cultivate within yourself a considerate and active love for others‚Ä¶

"Vox by Christina Dalcher is quickly becoming one of my favourite books which is crazy to me because it royally pisses me off!

The premise is that (like most dystopias) woman have been stripped of almost all their rights but this one is special. It doesn't just restrict reading, writing, education, etc. It restricts how many words they can saw a day to 100. Just try and count how many words you say on average in a day and then imagine that if you said more than 100, you would get an electric shock. That is the fate of every woman in this world.

Before this took hold, the main character, Jean, was a scientist, specifically one working with the brain. Her speciality (I suppose you could call it) was working on a cure for Wernicke's Aphasia. I didn't know what this was so I looked it up (point to the book for making me do my own research) and discovered that it affects the part of the brain that allows us to register and use, of course, words. This comes up later in a critical way but I don't want to spoil anything because I genuinely think people, both men and woman need to read this.

Along the way, we also get her interacting with her family. There is her husband who pretends to show support for her but you know that his heart isn't in it at all, her eldest son who has become almost completely indoctrinated and does some really horrible things because of it, her twin boys who are too young to completely understand what is happening and her daughter who is under the same restrictions as Jean but is, again, too young to completely comprehend anything more complex than the bare bones of her situation.

"After noticing all the hype surrounding this book, I decided I had to read it. I was hoping to be moved, to appreciate the value of education in my life (it did happen to a certain extent). While the theme was consistent, the book largely dealt with the author's memories of her childhood and teenage years (the book is fairly graphic in its descriptions).

The start was slow but once I was invested in the story, it was hard to put the book down. The conclusion felt a little lukewarm and sudden. It made me wonder if the author should've waited a few more years before penning this memoir. Nonetheless, it is her story and she made her choice. I enjoyed the book, but something felt amiss when it comes to the connection between the theme, the writing and the narrative. Can't quite put my finger on it.

"Hi all. I posted this on the speedreading subreddit but would like some viewpoints outside that community so I have less bias answers/different takes on things.

Hope it's book related enough

Thanks......

Hi all. 

I'm not looking to be a speed reader. I just want to be around average or even better, a fast reader. I'm not interested in 1000wpm.

Above average would suit me.

Just did an online test and my wpm was 133. My comprehension was 55% which is also poor. The comprehension would have been way lower if some of the answers weren't obvious. 

I'm 35 and I'm a pretty smart guy but my reading sucks balls. I read all the time too and always have.  But my reading  speed hasn't gotten any better. I don't read many books though really, mostly articles on science/politics/facts/history and whatnot.

My comprehension goes up if I'm interested in the subject to the point where I'll probably never forgot what I read. So comprehension is definetly related to interest. But I'd still like to improve comprehension as I think it could help me not have to reread stuff and help me read fiction which I do like but struggle with. A little more speed may keep me more interested too as my current speed is quite tiring and laboursome. 

But anyway I'm learning to program for a career change so I'd like to be able to get through my books a little faster. That's the main reason I am asking for advice here. 

I don't want to read so fast that my comprehension goes down as its quite high right now, (in relation to programing) although I often have to read sentences a few times. 

Ideally I'd like to quarter the amount of times I reread stuff (subjective as I can't really measure this easily) and double or more my wpm so that I'm the high end of average or a little more.

I have ADHD and apparently dyslexia too (even though my spelling is good) I think this comes down to the comprehension I was tested on back in college where I remembered nothing of what I read out loud (although I wasn't warned I'd need to remmeber it üòÇ) 

There are many articles online that say speed reading doesn't work or you lose comprehension or whatever (of course many argue the opposite) but not much info on how to just become faster and up to a normal speed  without any crazy expectations which has surely got to be possible. 

Should I use the same methods as speed reading to get up to average? Try to sub-vocalise less etc? Does anyone have any advice or specific course suggestions? Is there perhaps stuff I could look into that is more specific to slow readers becoming average and improving comprehension? 

Also people say it can take the joy out of reading but I'm hoping it makes it more joyful for me as I don't need to read things 100 times and it doesn't take a lifetime.

Anyway sorry that was long and rambly but thought it'd be best to be specific in case someone else has been in this situation before. 

Thanks",books,2932
"My Synopsis     

Isaac Asimov's \*I, Robot\* is group of short stories tied together from the perspective of a reporter interviewing the esteemed Dr. Susan Calvin of U.S. Robot and Mechanical Men, Inc.. Stories that she told the interviewer were of situations that individual's experienced throughout the history of the company. The aptly named U.S. Robot and Mechanical Men, Inc., are the only manufacturers of what is called the positronic brain, which gives their robots a version of consciousness as well as a leading edge analytical mind. Due to safety, all robots must be programmed with the 3 laws of robotics.

1) A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.

2) A robot must obey orders given to it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law.

3) A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law.

&amp;#x200B;

My Review

I really enjoyed \*I, Robot\*. Several of the short stories by Isaac Asimov were enthralling, wonderful, and mentally stimulating as you explored his almost optimistic vision of what the future might hold for humanity. My favorite two stories were \*Reason\* and \*Evidence\*. \*Reason\* explored the idea of robots holding a fictional belief to be more logical that being made by man, while \*Evidence\* is a political drama dealing with dispelling a rumor that a politician isn't as human as he says he is. Both stories made me stop and think about the ambiguity of several definitions and truths I hold as true in society. I think thats what makes \*I, Robot\* and sci-fi compelling, through the scope of science fiction you can explore deeper morality and questions that cannot be posed as easily through other genres. 

However every collection of stories tend to have some stories that don't hit the mark. For me, they were \*Runaround\* and \*Liar!\*. \*Runaround\* felt more of an exposition on how the three laws work, which might have been necessary, but led to a less interesting individual story. \*Liar!\* was the first outright story where Dr. Susan Calvin was the main character of the story, and her plot line centered around a crush on a coworker. I thought this plotline undermined the established character, and felt it was included only because of woman stereotypes at the time.

Overall, I thought \*I, Robot\* was fun and worth the read. I recommend this book to people who enjoy morally ambiguous and thought provoking stories, and definitely a must read in the hard sci-fi genre.

Thanks for reading my first post to the subreddit! I am trying to motivate myself to read more and engage with people.",books,2703
"Hey r/reading. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have finally come out of my own lockdown, and back to the office. My first time since March. I am a huge gamer, and have started a review on the games I have played over on r/patientgamers

&amp;#x200B;

However I also read more in the last 6 months than I have in years, and thought I would love to have a conversation about the books and nobody I know reads as much as I do. So hear I am.

&amp;#x200B;

The first (and main) series I read during my lockdown was the Undead series, by RR Heywood.

&amp;#x200B;

Now on the surface this your generic zombie book. However it quickly won me over as one of the best Zombie stories I have ever watched, read or played (Maybe on par with the Last of Us, but for very different reasons) 

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, there are 24 Books, and for the first 20 or so, each book took place within a 24 hour time span. It starts off fairly generic, with a guy named Howie working in a Tesco, going home and the zombie Apocalypse starts while he tried to survive. Now, while generic zombie stuff. The pacing is great and the first few books is fairly short. As the story goes on, more characters are introduced and Howie basically takes part of a small squad of soldiers, and this is on of the two way this book shines. The squaddie humor is brilliant, and frequently made me laugh out loud, before pulling me back into the gritty story, where main characters die JUST frequently enough to keep you on edge.

&amp;#x200B;

But it was the second side to the story which really set this book apart. Every so often, the series will tell the story from the Virus. So advanced, that it almost becomes a hive mind. Looking at this point of view, adapting itself to try and infect the world.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall the series was brilliant, and the author has adapted the story to get more convoluted, with government conspiracies and new characters (not all human) all with there own motivations and bringing there own twists to the plot. If you like zombie books, this series is a must read. 

&amp;#x200B;

But for the sake of fairness, the biggest issue I had. The 'filler.' Sometimes in the later books, the author seems to be trying to hit a word count. The first time it was quite funny, character repeating themselves in confusion, but when you have to read a page and a half of people of people saying goodnight is not a fun read and kills the otherwise great pacing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone else here read this series? what did you think- I would love to know.",books,2534

Does a good translation try to stay as faithful as possible, or does it grant the translator permission to essentially rewrite the book?

"I am talking about large non-fiction books. My recent one has been this amazing book on World War I (A World undone by G.J Meyer) , that I was initially hooked to. I sped through 45% of it in the course of 3 days. Then I got caught up with life, interviews, some light travelling, a fews days of quarantine and now I can't seem to be interested in continuing it. I am in the mood for some light fiction.

Now this  has happened before with the same book , I had completed 20 % of it in 2017. The book is objectively very good and well written, its just that I don't have the interest in the subject right now. I know I will want to read it again sometime later. But you can't just bookmark it and resume a few months later. There are so many characters and events you will not remember unless you took notes or something.

It's a really good series and the world vaguely reminds me of the Disney movie Sky High, but set in college. Of course there's a more interesting plot though. Don't want to spoil anything, but it's a series that keeps you interested even through something as dull as a math test. He also does a really good job at introducing each character gradually giving even the side characters enough time over the four main books to feel well rounded.


I think my biggest issues with the books come from the dialogue. In the first book there's an almost painful amount short dialogue followed by ""character's name said"" it just feels choppy, but it gets better in the following books.

The other dialogue issue I have, which I didn't realize was an issue until the spin-off book, is none of the characters really have unique dialogue, like each character uses the same phrases and descriptions that I imagine Drew himself uses in real life. It's a minor detail, but would help make the characters feel more well rounded.


All in all, I would love to see him write more books based in this universe.

"So I like classical literature; no real surprises there. Classical literature is, in my opinion, saturated in theme and some really, really wonderful examples of how characters should be portrayed. It‚Äôs night and day compared to some of the more modern works I‚Äôve plodded through recently.

But as with every good thing, there‚Äôs always a flaw, and with some of my favorites, this can really hinder congruency and overall understanding and enjoyment of a book, and surprisingly, it‚Äôs the translators of literature not originally penned in English. (I‚Äôm speaking of the perspective of a person who only speaks/reads fluently in English and can speak somewhat mediocre Spanish)

My best example comes from a universally famous and respected work from my very favorite author: a two-part  tragedy, ‚ÄúFaust‚Äù by Johann Wolfgang Goethe. As it is not the subject of this story, I will not go into the book itself, but to say that it is only fair that the contents of this play have made themselves known among philosophers and the like. Anyways, the first time I read ‚ÄúFaust‚Äù in its entirety, I actually read the two parts in two very distinct and separate translations: the first part in Peter Salm‚Äôs 1985 Dual-Language Revised Translation (which was excellent, by the way. The footnotes were easily accessible, and the dual language made it convenient to read a second time while listening along with a recording of the play itself), and the latter part in David Luke‚Äôs 1994 translation (while fine in all ways, the language used was marginally different, and it was set up with the footnotes/index of names in such a way that made me very frustrated while reading and investigating the cultural or political references specific to that time). I found that my view of the book as a whole greatly diminished while reading the second part only because the construct of the contents and text itself was so much different. Also, when reading The Divine Comedy at a later date, I found that I strongly deferred to one translation than the other, though both shared very similar wordings.

So now to the question: is this just my nitpicking the text, or have you experienced this too? If so, have a favorite translator(s) (and why, if you‚Äôre feeling like describing it)? I‚Äôm always on the hunt for new suggestions, especially if it involves rereading a favorite ^^",books,2351

"It almost seems that everyone enjoys dystopian-themed books, but I find those are big turn-off for me. It's not that I restrict my reading to good vibes only for lack of better words, as I've read and enjoyed many works with dark themes. I suppose it's becaue I find dystopias so dull and predictable, and there seems to be a surplus of them in my opinion.

I never wanted to bring up my dislike for these types of books when I talk about literature because people I've met say that you *should* read them, that the themes they present are *so* relevant to today's world and should make us question our society, that they are ""unpretentious"" and ""more realistic"" compared to other genres (I actually find them to be *more* pretentious than other genres), and the like. It's almost like it's childish to not enjoy these kinds of books, from what I've heard. Yes, I understand why the dystopian genre has it's place in literature, but that doesn't give me a good enough reason to like it.

"I believe that Edgar Rice Burroughs is a fairly unknown author yet a number of his books are very well known because of movies, such as Tarzan and John Carter. I've only read a number of three of his series. 

Tarzan is an incredible book and the actual story he makes for Tarzan is awesome. It's a very raw and fairly brutal story with many amusing aspects as tarzan learns the ways of man (and that killing people is considered murder, not sport like a lion. Tarzan murders a lot of people lol). The first three books are about as good as the last. However, after about 4 books, starting with and after The Jewels of Opar, the books become very predictable and stupid like a tv show that just needs to die. He jsut creates all these stupid plot lines and of course a woman is involved and tarzan gets into a crazy situation yet escapes, saves the girl yada yada.  

John Carter is similar to Tarzan. Awesome books and stories and the world he makes is pretty interesting and original for the time, keeping you engaged and interested throughout. Very much worth the read. Like Tarzan, after the 2nd or third book instead of ending the plot he just starts to create random stupid plot lines and adventures with new unnecessary adversaries when the book could have ended perfectly after 2-3 books. Just imagine it does and stop reading.

The Land that Time Forgot and the People that Time Forgot. Shorter books yet very unique plot taking place on a lost continent during WW1.  Worth the read for sure as the second book provides a lot of detail that sin't realized in the first. Second book isn't quite as good as the first, but still very good and worth the short time it takes to read it.

Taking control of such a machine was a VR-like experience, but for the protagonist, who had epilepsy or something and so had had a brain implant or similar beforehand, they could 'become' the machine, and were substantially better at it than others.  There's a romance aspect, where a girl from Russia (?), nicknamed Medusa for facial scarring (birth defects?), who had had similar implants and so was equally good, met the protagonist during their remote warfare and they fell in love.  The protagonist organized for them to meet in Madagascar.  That's everything I remember (and it's a surprising amount, because it's definitely been a few years and I have a horrible memory).  Does anybody know what book/novel/series this is?",books,1058

"After years of hearing how good Sabriel is, I finally read the first book of the series, and will continue on.

  
I was honestly caught off guard at how dark some of the necromancy elements were, very pleasantly surprised. Nix has a great way of alluding to the darkness, without being overly descriptive of the horror such as how Stephen King may have described certain things.   


I was also thrown off guard by the pace of the book. It seems to jump from one explosive thing to another. Did not seem like there was alot of fluff.

Others who loved Sabriel.... any other recommendations (aside the obvious Dune, LOTR, GOT, Gunslinger, Three Body, etc).

When I was younger, I recall reading a book, and I remember loving it. Only problem is, I remember very little about it, and have googled every combination of words, to no avail.

I recall the main character was a man, with an imaginary friend. I believe part of the plot was he never gave up his childhood friend so they're both adults now. 

Towards the start of the book i recall something happens and the character goes deaf for a second, and then when he hears again he finds a letter?

"oh dear oh dear.. I've never posted on this thread before, but I was feeling annoyed and wanted to vent where I am anonymous. The first book, I am Number Four, was quite interesting imo. This book, however, was the most annoying cringe ever. Let me lay it out for you guys:

what I like: I really like the storyline revolving Marina. Overall, I think she's a pretty likeable character. She pretty much saved this book for me. I also liked learning more about Six, and appreciate her bravery.

what I didn't like: okay, here we go. Let's start with the dialogue. It was awkward. I cringed when Six, Sam and Four were all together. Am I supposed to believe this is how three young teenagers speak to each other??? Is this how I spoke when I was a teen?? good grief. And if I hear Four talk about how in love he is one more time, I'm gonna take my chancla to him i swear. Sarah this, Sarah that.. Boy you are barely 16. He is such an idiot. He makes terrible decisions. I would normally forgive it if I thought it was a part of plot development, but I actually don't think this is the case for him. Maybe his terrible decision making is because he's so young, or maybe it's because Henri babied him so much. Why wait until he is a teenager to start training him? I would've been training that boy since we arrived. Speaking of Henri, his real alien name is... Brandon. Yeah. Nothing wrong with the name Brandon, but I don't really get why he saw the need to go by a name that sounds more alien than his actual name. (according to the audiobook, it's pronounced sort of like on-ree... I thought it was just the normal Henry with an i lol)

Anyway, I'm almost done listening to this one. I don't normally listen to audiobooks, but the ebook wasn't available through my library app, so you gotta do what you gotta do. I don't think it helped that a grown man was reading Four's perspective, and therefore also gave voice to Six and Sam. It just made the dialogue more awkward, especially how he made Six sound so cliche with his raised voice.. and he made Sam just sound plum dumb.

What did you guys think??",books,2102

* Why do you think Andr√© Marsac gave up his information to the Germans? Do you think he really thought he could free himself this way?
* Do you think Odette's story to the Germans that Peter was Winston Churchill's nephew was a good or a bad idea?

It was a leap of faith for the person who suggested the book, so I would like to say something positive.   


The book had decent potential at the beginning, but it throws you into the drama way to quickly, has multiple editing errors (a character named Bart is often typoed as Bat or But), and there is no character development. The characters and circumstances aren't even remotely believable, and two child characters are left (by adults) to fend for themselves in the woods for most of a week. the main character decides that even though her life and the lives of those she cares about are in grave peril she just has to have and deserves a beautiful wedding brunch because she's the bride.

"I've been reading fantasy, scifi, and horror since I was a kid, and I've noticed in the last few years that more and more that some of these books seem to be *obsessed* with the tropes of their genre. Either in upending them, or leaning into them. or just otherwise acknowledging them, catering to an audience that is in love with certain tropes, and wants to see them displayed repeatedly. There's some aspects of this that are nothing new. For example, in the 90s-00s there was a ""vampire craze"" in which droves of readers were obsessed with buying vampire books *because* they were about vampires and *regardless* of whether they were good.

But I'll give the vampire craze this: it wasn't *about* plot tropes. Like, yeah, vampire books usually adhere to the same tropes (here's a vampire, he's sexy, there's some angst) but the reason people were *reading* was just because the book was *about* vampires, in a broad sense.

Now, I see things like people saying: ""I want a book that is Enemies-to-Lovers."" (the first time I heard that, I was honestly thinking ""wtf"" to myself) And they are presented with a whole list of options that are going to give them their chosen PLOTLINE, not just setting or theme, PLOT. Because largely, books are being written and published to cater to this. It's reliable. Everywhere I go I see A: action-packed stories that B: have characters with superpowers that C: tend to be very genre-savvy and D: have some kind of romantic/sexual interest that E: adheres to something picked off a practically fetishized ""relationship trope"" board and F: expresses some kind of self-conscious ""snarkiness"" that occasionally borders on the sentiment of: ""This is trash and I, the author, know it.""

So do I see the entirety of A-F in every book? No. But it's more noticeable when one of them is *missing* than when it is *present*. And my problem is that I like being surprised, and I like seeing things that are new and different. So obviously I pick up books with absolutely bizarre settings and concepts, and these things seem to be displayed *even more* prominently.

Am I exaggerating? Also bonus points for recommending SF/Fantasy/Horror books that don't revel in ""being trash.""

"Have you read the Dune books? Compared to those how hard to read is LOTR?

So I am a 15-year-old who has read books from 200 pages to 600 pages taking anywhere from between a day to a month. About 2 months back I started the first Dune book, I finished it within a month. So I picked the next one up, and read it with a week. I have read the third one too and am pretty sure that I'll go on the read the rest of the Frank Herbert Dune books. I have heard some people say that Dune is hard to read and I did find some parts draggy but didn't challenge my tenacity much. 

So after reading Dune I was inspired to take up other series and have set my sight on the LOTR books. I have read online that they are pretty hard to read. On Quora and Reddit some people said that they could only get past them in their 3rd or 4th attempt. So exactly how hard to read is LOTR and will I find it that hard after reading Dune? I'm asking this because I live in a country that's still smack in the middle of the pandemic and hence the books stores aren't open and amazon and other take at least 3 weeks to deliver them.

"Today's world is in a state where reality and cruelty are a reflection of Albert Camus's book The Plague (French - ""*La Peste*""). Translated into English by Stuart Gilbert

Albert Camus, the second youngest person to win the Nobel Prize in Literature. In 1956, at the age of 44, he wins the novel prize. He is a French-Algerian citizen born in 1913 in Oran or Algeria. The city of Oran, or Algeria, was then a French colony. There is a beautiful story about the naming of the city of Oran, which I cannot resist the urge to tell.

Oran is a language that comes from North Africa, which means Lion. It is known that there was a mountain near Oran with some lions around it, it is not known exactly why the last two surviving lions were killed, but after their death, the mountain was named La Montagne des lions (The Mountain of Lions). Since then, sculptures of two large lions have carried the identity of the city of Oran.

At that time the struggle of the French to grow up with great blessings like poverty, with adversity like deprivation, oppression, restricted freedom of speech, career, writing, journalism

Everything seems to bring a gentle vibration to his nerves. He painted a picture of the plague and that is, **The Absurdism** (which highlights the urge to find mankind's own and innate values ‚Äã‚Äãand the ultimate contradiction of the failure to find meaning in life in this irrational, meaningless, chaotic universe.)

The practical application of which he has arranged perfectly in this book. When he started writing, he could still hear the unbearable horrors of World War II.

By 1940, Nazi forces had invaded Paris. Seeing that the situation was dangerous, the writer wanted to escape, but just then he Trapped in the French Resistance (a kind of movement or resistance system where an association of armed men and women is formed and the mass media for the exchange of some secret and strategic information by which the French can fight the Nazis)

The cruelty and killings of Hitler and his Nazi forces are still rooted in history. Which the author never mentions in the book, doesn‚Äôt even indicate the melody of the French cries, but he shows it in the form of a cholera epidemic.

&gt;*""Once plague had shut the gates of the town, they had settled down to a life of separation, debarred from the living the warmth that gives forgetfulness of all.""*  
\_\_Albert Camus

He described at the beginning, his hometown of Oran, where there was no fluttering of birds' wings, only the sound of gunpowder, The sweet sunshine of the sun was occupied with the cruel domination, and instead of the cold fog of winter, there was poisonous black smoke floating through the burned black wounds of the bombed-out city houses, graves, and places.

In fact, Albert Camus himself was a direct witness to this black chapter. His description of the real inhuman situation metaphorically refers to the cholera epidemic, which can be understood by reading the novel.

&gt;*""There have been as many plagues as the war in history, yet always plagues and wars take people equally by surprise.""*  
\_\_Albert Camus

As a sign of the terrible nature of the epidemic, especially mass infant mortality. In the midst of so much horror, every man is still desperate to save his life with the lamp of hope. Peeking at the list of survivors in the midst of countless death rows, whether you will see your name or not, whether you will have the opportunity to bathe in the light of a new beginning and a new sun, whether you will be able to witness a new sunrise with your loved one in your hands. , Just waiting for the opportunity given by the Creator.

&gt;*""The love of God is hard love. It demands total self-surrender, disdain of our human personality. And yet it alone can reconcile us to suffering and the deaths of children, it alone can justify them, since we cannot understand them, and we can only make God's will ours. ""*  
\_\_ Albert Camus

Among the few main characters in this novel, I liked most of the following three characters;

* **Dr. Bernerd Rieux**

Dr. Bernerd Rieux, age 35, is a very optimistic entity who has black hair with a medium figure. But indifference to the Creator, he can be an atheist. It is not his identity, his existence is ignited when, when all the countries are swept away in the epidemic, survival is as mysterious as a smile of fate, in that crisis he becomes an angel and descends alone to serve the sick. How much more can a man do? He was the first to use the word ""plague"" in this epidemic. Moreover, when he realizes that his struggle for all these indifferent and helpless sick people will be defeated by inevitable death,

Even then, this real man, inspired them with the hope of living in a new way from the weak, which kept them mentally alive, because his religion is hope....

"The things that drew me to it were (i) that soaring, lyrical final sentence, which I read out of context and which made me expect more of the same from the narrator, (ii) the general reputation the book seems to enjoy among its enthusiastic followers, (iii) its consistent presence high among the lists of great English novels of critics.  

My reaction is one of mild deflation.  The book is a pretty good Victorian novel, but . . . 

* The narrator's (or implied narrator's, if you like) voice is intriguing at first but it becomes an extended exercise in posturing, because it seems to be linked to the various artificial turns in the plot that resolve matters.   
* Dorothea, the heroine of the last sentence, is in the end a kind of shallow or ethereal figure whose virtues are not really shown but rather told to us in the finale that sums up the fates of many of the others.  She gives up a second fortune that she didn't want or need when she wakes up to something so obvious even her head-in-the-clouds husband realized.
* The one character who lives up to 'virtuous obscurity' seems to be Caleb Garth.  
* Lydgate's episode with the French actress seems out of place and melodramatic and not believable.
* Fred Vincy was more convincing as a spoiled, insensitive, selfish guy headed for his comeuppance; his transformation and redemption struck me as contrivances.  
* In the end, the book's early promise of a mildly tragic overview of the limitations of people in one small village is superseded by its overall comedic resolutions:  things somehow work out for most of the characters--we are told, not shown--contrary to the flawed fates that the novel seems to pointing them towards.",books,1696

I had a new hope that my life is gonna get better . We have read the line ""Adapt to change"" many times but never thought about it.

"I'm a big true crime nut, and I recently finished 'I'll Be Gone In The Dark', and I was honestly shaken. Obviously the subject matter itself is heavy stuff and extremely tragic, but the way it was written was just something else. Naturally, I went and read the entirety of Michelle's blog too(True Crime Diary) and it was just as good! It's so tragic that she passed before the arrest was made in the case, and it's a shame that we won't get to read more of her work(I wonder how her style would translate to other genres).

Even though I'm pretty fascinated by true crime, it's tough for me to stay engrossed in it for too long because I'm very faint at heart and it gets too much. But Michelle's work was incredibly captivating, and the excursions about her own life somehow amplify the narrative. I just couldn't stop! I don't know exactly what it is, but I've never quite read anything quite like her stuff in the genre. I've read other great true crime classics that I thought were excellent, including The Stranger Beside Me, In Cold Blood, The Onion Fields, My Dark Places, etc, but this was just different. I started Green River Running Red(I'm definitely taking a big break from true crime after this, getting way too much for me) right after, which is also brilliant, but it just didn't hit the same notes as McNamara. Gone too soon for sure.

"In his book published in 1957, *Anatomy of Criticism*, Northrop Frye extensively discussed the role of literary ""public"" critics which are different from the ""systematic"" scholarly critics. In his opinion the former category consists of those critics who are the best representatives of the cultivated, general public. If 50 years ago such a category was - more or less - self-explanatory, nowadays it is much more difficult to identify it. For instance, can we consider some influential bloggers or TV personalities such ""public"" critics?

What I would like to learn is if we still have such a category of ""professional readers"" who are in permanent contact with the general public and who can shape the taste of contemporary readers.",books,735

"The book's main character is a female child that always wears pajamas, her eyes change colors with the weather, she has her father but her mother either died or just isn't the picture. She has, I believe, just one best friend. There is some kind of dream or fantasy world that she finds and can enter. At some point, there is some malevolent character in the fantasy world that attempts and almost succeeds in entering the real world.

"I love genre-bending novels and some descriptions I've read of Outlander sound interesting to me, but I'm also concerned that maybe it's a series that just isn't written with a reader like me in mind. I've read a lot of great books written from the perspectives of female protagonists, and I like a good romance plot, so I'm not writing it off as ""chick stuff"" based on that.  
 
That being said, a lot of commentary about the series I've seen focuses on the appeal of the hunky male love interest, and that's something that I wouldn't be able to relate to as a straight man. Reading comments, I just can't really get a sense of how much of the appeal comes from steamy fantasies about a sexy Scottish guy and how much comes from interesting characters and dramatic development.
 
For anyone who's read the series, does Outlander appeal pretty much exclusively to a female fantasy, or would I enjoy it as a man?",books,911

Life is a journey about ‚ÄúWhat if‚Äôs &amp; ‚ÄúOnly if‚Äôs‚Äù we never talk about. Stories we are afraid to share, simply because they hurt too much or no one wants to listen to them.

I wrote this book based on my own experiences. No matter how bad your situation is, there is always a way out.

Not a word document, the book is effectively illustrated with HD images and info-graphs.

There are three rules:

1. If you do not step forward, you will remain in the same place.

2. Let everything that hurts you teach about the things you deserve.

3. If you understand, life isn‚Äôt what you‚Äôre given, it‚Äôs what you create, what you conquer and what you aim to achieve.

If you like a really nice, long story about a strong lead character with quite a bit of growth, you'll probably like this. 

I'd been scared aware from 19th century British lit from Charles Dickens, but this is a lot better than his stuff. 

Charlotte Bronte is, I think, a much better writer and someone who can really focus on personal relationships and wrap drama around personal growth in a growing sense of tension that seems quite modern although obviously the novel itself isn't at all modern.

"I have been on a serious Bukowski kick lately and in Charles Bukowski On Writing, he mentions several times about the impact of Fante on him. In particular, he praises Ask The Dust as one of the greatest books ever written in his opinion. I read a preview of it on Amazon and immediately went on my library's website to have it sent to my local library from another library for pickup. When I went to add it on my Goodreads account I realized it says it's book #3 in The Saga of Arturo Bandini.   


Ask The Dust having received such praise from Bukowski I really wanted to read that one specifically (though I don't doubt the others are also good).

"DeLillo's new novel *The Silence* is being published in October, and Harper's this month [has an excerpt](https://harpers.org/archive/2020/10/time-to-destination-don-delillo/).  It looks like it comes from an early part of the novella, which is DeLillo's first work since Zero K in 2016.

The official synopsis:

&gt;It  is Super Bowl Sunday in the year 2022. Five  people, dinner, an  apartment on the east side of Manhattan. The retired  physics professor  and her husband and her former student waiting for the  couple who will  join them from what becomes a dramatic flight from  Paris. The  conversation ranges from a survey telescope in North-central  Chile to a  favorite brand of bourbon to Einstein's 1912 Manuscript on  the Special  Theory of Relativity. Then something happens and the digital   connections that have transformed our lives are severed. What follows is a dazzling and profoundly moving conversation about what makes us human.

While there has been generally mixed review of most of his work since *Underground* was published, I think his novellas (*The Body Artist* and *Point Omega*)  have actually been his strongest work since then. This excerpt  definitely has some of the wry dialogue and obsession with how language  defines the world around you that DeLillo is famous for. If you like  what you see, r/DonDeLillo will be doing a group read from early November, so do  join us if interested.

When I read chapter 2 I knew this book was gonna be something special. I loved how I understood how Holden was feeling. I was and still a little am, though not as much as Holden, judgemental and self-involved. My friends and I considered almost everyone we met phonies, however now I'm trying to control that tendency within me.

"
My son, Sage, was born 13 weeks early and my wife had to have an emergency cesarean. For those 13 weeks, Sage had to spend his time in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU).
While in NICU, Sage was on the CPAP (Continuous positive airway pressure) to help him breathe. Everytime we had cares with him, we were allowed to have skin to skin cuddles with him, once a day. My wife and I took turns. 
My wife began reading kids books but because they were so short and the minimum time we could have skin to skin was 30 minutes, each day, those small books became repetitive. 
Being an advocate reader of fantasy, I decided I would The Hobbit to him. Each skin to skin cuddles I read to him. Within 3 weeks, I finished The Hobbit, but I still wanted to read fantasy but I felt LOTR would've been frowned upon by the nurses so instead, I began HP and the Philosophers Stone. 
Now, Sage is out of hospital and at home. I've finished HP and now up to the fourth book. 

This post is an appreciation to how reading books changed the quality of time spent with my son in NICU and how it has helped put him to sleep at home. 
I can't describe how much reading books to him has strengthened my love for him. Even though he won't remember the stories I read to him, he knows my voice and that helps him sleep. 

Without that time reading with my son, the hospital would‚Äôve been a bleak and horrible experience for our family. Thank you books.

"As an angry teenage girl who couldn't see her boyfriend, I daydreamed with being taken away. Kind of an erotic fantasy.

It started with cute stuff such as Hades and Persephone or The Phantom of the Opera. Then I moved to heavier stuff, real kidnappings. Not proud, but I fantasized with something very distant from reality and I know the reasons.

I bought ""The Collector"" by John Fowles. I would focus on the obssessive love the kidnapper had for his victim, the less sexually violent, the more I would like it, because my obssession was certainly not about rape. There's not much sexual violence until the point I read. Frederick obssessed over Miranda and kept her away against her will like he would do with a butterfly.

My teenage fantasy faded off as I grew up and became less angry. I'm sure I would have an entirely different interpretation if I picked up this book to re-read it. I'm still a psychology major and curious about how a stalker's mind works, so it would still be a good read. Just more disgusting now.

"Author Rick Yancey‚Äôs main claims to fame include the 5th Wave series, which made it all the way into films, and the Alfred Kropp series, a favorite of English teachers for projects, but, in my opinion, his true masterpieces came in a four-book package, starting in 2009 with ‚ÄúThe Monstrumologist.‚Äù

Little-known compared to his other work, I‚Äôd never actually heard of this particular book until, one dull day, as I was scavenging the YA library section for something that piqued my interest, I found the first volume perched in a new space in the small shelf labeled ‚ÄúPatron‚Äôs Choice‚Äù. (I have found sone truly remarkable books in the YA section, and this was no exception.) As an avid connoisseur of horror fiction, I was hooked as soon as I laid eyes on the quote from the text written on the upper portion of the back cover. Now having read the collection twice in its entirety (and currently going on three for Wiki research purposes), I will now make my case for these wonderful books.

All of the books are set in the Victorian era, the first three focused in 1888 and 1889, and the fourth retelling three separate stories, one before and two after this timeline, in a parallel narrative. The prose us written from the perspective of the main protagonist, one William James Henry, the young assistant of Doctor Pellinore Xavier Warthrop, who is the aforementioned ‚ÄúMonstrumologist‚Äù. The books follow the time Will Henry spends with the doctor, and how his experiences warp him and the doctor into very different people in the last book ‚ÄúThe Final Descent‚Äù, the title of which tells you really all you need to know about the last installment.

I‚Äôm aware that I‚Äôm single-handedly trying to reawaken a very dead fandom, but I still don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs really had its time. So next time you‚Äôre in need of a fresh series, consider picking up ‚ÄúThe Monstrumologist‚Äù (and maybe it‚Äôs sequels), but be warned: this book is, in fact, marketed as Young Adult Fiction, but I, and many others share this view, believe that this description is a little off. Not to speak for everyone‚Äôs preferences, but these books are QUITE heavy on descriptions of the phantasmagorical creatures and the bloodier scenes, so if that‚Äôs not for you, DON‚ÄôT PUSH IT. Stay safe, you cool cats, and stay away from topics that are uncomfortable for you. (Especially the second and third books. While thematically brilliant, the theme also rests upon the shoulders of some not exactly PG creatures and the mayhem that they create.)

I won‚Äôt spoil anything here (minus character names), but if you have further questions, feel free to comment/dm me! I love chatting about this series, and the Fandom Wiki is both undersupplied and partially incorrect, so I wouldn‚Äôt recommend going there. I‚Äôd love to hear from any of you hepcats who‚Äôve read it; I‚Äôm looking for a good person to discuss the series with, since I‚Äôd like a fresh perspective on the themes present.

Etsuko struggles to discuss this with Niki, and the rest of the novel shows her reminiscing about her life in Japan. 

This short novel, running just under 200 pages, is bursting with themes, the most prominent of which is perhaps that of the interplay between memory, trauma, and personal narrative. As Etsuko tells us about her life in post-war Nagasaki, we're told nothing about Keiko, and the story focuses instead on the period when Etsuko was pregnant with Keiko. Aside from her first husband, Jiro Ogata, and her father-in-law, Seiji, Etsuko mostly interacts with Sachiko, a slightly older war widow, and Sachiko's daugher, Mariko. These two timelines appear to have little to do with each other, until they abruptly intersect amidst some remarkable parallels, conflicting memories, and bizarre distortions in narrative voice. It's a brilliant exploration of the unreliability of our memories, as well as an example of what processing grief and trauma may look like.

This personal trauma is set against a backdrop of tumultuous societal change across the generations, punctuated by a world war. Seiji Ogata struggles to connect with his son, Jiro, who brushes him off with excuses about his busy job. Seiji is also tormented by an article by a former student of his, in which he is denounced for his imperialist stance as a schoolteacher during the run-up to the war. The role of women in Japanese society also undergoes a welcome evolution, and Niki's life in London would be incomprehensible to Seiji. 

The prose is quiet and elegant, striking a perfect balance between pretty descriptions of scenery and the detached, almost depersonalised tone with which Etsuko recounts her memories. Add to that some masterfully crafted dialogue, and we get an overall atmosphere that is contemplative, pensive, and haunting, at times eerie and outright horrific. The characters are written incredibly well, and they are both instantly believable and intricately layered. 

I found this a very powerful read that will linger in my mind for much longer than the short time it took to complete it. Far from being an overpoweringly tragic tear-jerker, it's nonetheless a meditative and thought-provoking book about painful subjects.",books,2661

I recommend you to read this series as it's my personal favorite!!
It's every book includes different action and adventure...

Young bond series is one of the best non-fiction/spy genre series that I have ever known. It's story is based on the great detective we have ever known ""The James Bond....""

As we know, it is based on fictional character so it is not an autobiography. It is written by Charlie  Higson.
Following a treacherous rescue mission in the freezing Alps, James Bond is preparing for life back at Eton. But James's every move is being watched.He alone holds clue to a sinister plot that will bring bloodshed and carnage to his school and his country... Soon he is trapped in a deadly war of secrets and lies...

"I have lived my whole life in this country. Love it with all my heart but there has always been one thing that has irked me to no end. There is not a single good library in the whole damn country. The ones that are there have not more than a single shelf of books and that too only religious books. I have always had to buy second hand books from people selling them or borrow from friends. The bookshops by the way are so damn expensive. And they are not even newly published or anything. I have probably bought a total of five new books in my whole life. Of course it still wasnt enough to deter me from my love of reading books. Of course ebooks and pdfs are available but the craving for that new book smell is always there.

Because of this I always tried my very best to gift my book loving friends with a new book because i know just how sucky it feels to read from a tiny mobile. I do of course now always make sure to buy new books that i really want and make sure the little kids i know who love reading books have access to them as well. I have always dreamed of opening a library in my country that would allow people to borrow books and hopefully introduce a lot more people to the joy of reading books. 

I very much hope to realize this dream one day.",books,1266
" I've noticed that my enjoyment of reading a given novel is heavily dependent on the writing style of the author.

And  I don't necessarily want it to be, I want to enjoy reading more  things, I want to keep an open mind. Recently I'd finished reading The  Westing Game, a novel I'd read faster and thought about more than any  book in a long time, it was great. Surely it was just that I'd gotten  back into reading again, ups and downs and all that. Well I tried The  House in the Cerulean Sea... and bounced hard as nails off it. Trying to  read past a few pages was like the literary equivalent of nails on  chalkboard for me. So I tried The Seven (and a half?) Deaths of Evelyn  Hardcastle, not as bad, but still just boring, and at all nothing like  immediately being sucked in.

And  then I tried them both again, first one then the next. I gave it time,  page after page after page. I can't do it, I can't bring myself to read  them. And it's not like I can say the story of either isn't something  appealing to me. I can't say either is an ""objectively a bad book!""  whatever that's supposed to mean. I just can't stand the writing style,  while Ellen Raskin's writing style in The Westing Game sucked me in as  smooth as anything.

Does anyone  else feel like this with books? How do you cope with it, how do you even  start to try and find the right books to read when fans usually talk  about tone, characters, plot, and etc. but rarely writing style, a thing  I'd hard to describe accurately to begin with.",books,1519

I'm literally just 3 chapters in and I'm already hooked.I don't know what the apogee holds,but I have a feeling that it won't be something positive considering how Hazel mentions again and again her inevitable death and how this book's main theme is about making the best out of every situation.

Personally for me it was a book from a sex cult leader. I was surprised by the rather large selection of wicca books that my local suburban library carried and, knowing nothing about it, I started reading a bunch of them. One book stood out to me because it was obviously grooming underage lonely girls for this guy's personal sex cult using wicca as a cover. It was well-written, charismatic, and very convincing. Predatory in a way I haven't experienced in another book. Part of it was that this book was a sequel in the series (""advanced core text 3 as he called it). I assume his first two books (which I didn't read) were more subtle.

**Kobo** \- eBooks and Audiobooks with their own apps and readers.

**Bookfinder** \- *I wondered whether to include this one or not since it's owned by Abebooks which in turn is owned by Amazon.  In the end, it's a search sight with no direct sales, but links to other sights, so I decided to include it.*  A meta search engine that searches about 40 different seller sites.¬† It has a lot of options for narrow searches, such as first editions (though always double check the listing),¬† and comes in 6 different languages.¬† This often tends to be my go-to site, but it doesn't search all sites out there, like Bookshop or Powell's.¬† If you want a list of sites it searches there's a link at the bottom of their page.¬†There were times when I felt that it favored Amazon too heavily, but lately in my experience that doesn't seem to be the case.

**Publisher Websites** \- I can't really offer a specific link here, but always check with publishers, particularly if it's a small one.¬† Often you can get the same, brand new book directly from the publisher cheaper, or at least similarly priced.¬† This works well for harder to find items.¬† I had a heck of a time trying to find a particular book earlier this year for a decent price until I got the idea to look up the publisher where I got a brand new one even though it'd been a couple decades since it had been released.¬† Many authors these days also self publish and will have a back stock, which means that if you buy directly from them, then they'll typically see a larger share.

&amp;#x200B;

***Other:***

**Book Mooch** \- A book swapping site.¬† I've never used it, but it's an interesting concept.¬† Free, not counting shipping.

**Scribd** \- An ebook¬† and audiobook site with its own app that offers items for a subscription.

&amp;#x200B;

***Library sites and apps:***¬† The vast majority of libraries have a variety of digital services available, but I also encourage everyone to use non-digital services as well.¬† These sites require a library card from your local library and for that library to subscribe to them.¬† If you're in the US, most public libraries just require you to just have an in-state residence to get a card, so if your local library doesn't use the service you want, you may be able to find one in your state somewhere.¬† Some libraries, like the Brooklyn Public Library, offer subscriptions to their online services for out of state patrons.¬† University libraries typically require you to be a student or alumnus, but often allow on-site access to certain services (the same goes for public libraries).

**Overdrive and Libby** \- eBook and Audiobook app.¬† Tends to be the most popular one for libraries.¬† Libby has mostly phased out the Overdrive app, but it's still not available in the Amazon app store.¬† I'd suggest going through the library website which will link you to their Overdrive catalog, or the Overdrive website can help you find a library to get you set up, then log in to the app or just use a browser.¬† Each ebook is licensed, meaning there are limited simultaneous copies that can be borrowed, just like getting a physical copy from your library.

**Hoopla** \- Another great resource for ebooks and audiobooks.¬† Works a bit differently than Overdrive/Libby in that there are no wait lists.¬† You have a certain number of borrows a month, but if the item in the catalog, then you can borrow it.¬† No holds.

**RB Digital** \- A newish service that originally specialized magazines and comics.  It's since added quite a number of audiobooks and ebooks.

**Kanopy** \- I'm cheating a bit here, since this site/app isn't for books, but movies.¬† Of course, Amazon isn't just books, so I think it counts.¬† This is a fantastic streaming service and several of the movie search sites even search on it.",books,5508

"I recently got back into reading books. I was scanning my bookshelf for a book that I had bought prior but had yet to actually read. I noticed this book and started reading it. I will admit the first bit of it was quite good. I enjoyed the multiple point of views, the suspense and time jump. 

Throughout the book I was anticipating a shocking reveal as to who killed Maria. So I was quite let down when it was revealed to be the brother Lucas. The reveal came out of nowhere too. Quite literally Zoe and Lucas were washing their baby sister when he confessed out of thin air. I was waiting for Tom Robinson to have some sort of involvement or even perhaps Sam even after Lucas confessed. While I didn't expect Lucas to be the killer (at the beginning) it was still made clear that he did it by accident and it was only done because Maria's husband, Chris was going to hurt her. Throughout whole novel it was clear Chris had some sort of involvement so it didn't surprise me one bit. 

I also felt like her whole backstory could've gotten a bit more closure? What exactly happened at that party? Was her drink spiked? When was it? Just a little let down by the ending.",books,1169

"For me at least, it has to be Eric Walters from Canada because of the versatility of his stories as he can easily do any type of genre whether it's dystopian with his rule of three series or him doing a story about 9/11 and even doing stories that combine a couple of genres as well. one of the reasons why people outside of Canada that don't know him is because people are not really exposed to his stories as often as other people

"I've noticed that the new reddit hate sink is JK Rowling. I support trans rights and do not support TERFs. However, I think it's very silly how people now like to neg JK Rowling and Harry Potter and then go around and give each other high fives. 

Harry Potter is and was a magical, well-constructed, series that dealt with mature themes and serves as possibly one of the most influential books in pop culture in recent memory. The seven-book series achieved following the growth of a boy from the ages of 11 to 18,  a memorable cast of characters with their own subplots, complicated themes, and a satisfying finale.  

There are things that could have been better done in the series but I would kill to have written as well and as intentionally as she did. Yes, I like some books better than Harry Potter, but at a certain point that reflects my own personal preferences rather than any glaring Harry Potter flaw. 

I am disappointed if reddit lets an author's statements reflect badly on a book where those views are not even relevant. I respect her as a writer even if I do not respect her as a political figure, twitter influencer, or retcon addict.",books,1154

"Apropos of nothing, today seemed like it would be a good time to highlight a few trans and non-binary creators whose work I've enjoyed lately. If you've been looking to diversify your reading, here are a few excellent options to consider :) I primarily read scifi/fantasy, which is reflected below - if you've read books by trans or enby authors in other genres lately, please feel free to mention them in the comments! I would love to hear about what you think of them. 

- The Four Profound Weaves by RB Lemberg

Author and their partner, Bogi Takacs (also a writer and worth a look!) are non-binary, Jewish, and of Middle Eastern heritage. Bogi is Hungarian, not sure about RB. This is a simply stunning novella set in a Middle Eastern-inspired fantasy setting; it features two elderly trans protagonists on a fairytale-like journey of self discovery. It's easily in my top five releases of 2020. It's beautiful, poetic, and gosh just so good.

- Ninefox Gambit by Yoon Ha Lee

Yoon is a trans man of Korean Heritage. I have absolutely adored everything he's written; Ninefox Gambit is the first in his Machineries of Empire trilogy. If you like a blend of weird fantasy and science fiction, this is the book for you. Also keep an eye out for his upcoming stand-alone novel, Phoenix Extravagant, which is ALSO absolutely amazing!

- Cemetery Boys by Aiden Thomas

Aiden is a queer latinx trans man. This is a YA novel with a trans, lantinx protagonist. It's set in California, and features a latinx family of witches! It's got a nice little romantic subplot to it. It's a lot of fun.

- The Deep &amp; Dark Blue by Niki Smith

Niki is queer. Their middle grade graphic novel features a trans protagonist's journey of discovery and acceptance alongside some truly gorgeous art. This is a great choice if you're buying a gift for a younger family member, or for if you just want something light and pleasant to read yourself!

- Queen of the Conquered by Kacen Callender

Kacen is Black and trans. Queen of the Conquered is an unflinchingly brutal look at slavery and race relations in a fantasy Carribean-inspired setting. They also wrote Felix Ever After, which has been a hit in YA circles and features a Black trans main character, though I haven't personally read it it yet.

**Plus short list of other trans/non-binary authors who are worth a look!**

- Neon Yang (NB)
- Sarah Gailey (NB)
- Alex Myers (Trans man)
- Rivers Solomon (NB)
- Isaac R Fellman (Trans man)
- Linden A Lewis (Queer)
- Katherine Locke (NB)

So, if there's any particular reason you might be hoping to support trans/enby authors right now... I hope this little list helps out :)",books,2658
"As book readers, or authors, how do you guys feel about this idea?

&amp;#x200B;

This may not be the right sub to post this on but I'm currently writing a murder mystery and I had this idea of having the first couple chapters be 3rd person objective, so we see all the events leading up to the murder. Then after the murder occurs we switch to the POV of the detective. That way we know everything that happened so the reader can see who's lying or twisting the truth on what happened.

"I'm not a bookworm, but I like reading, and the ultimate death of my reading is staying in pace or choosing a book, and staying in pace is easier than choosing a book btw. I've got some pretty good reads, but some reads I just conclude obviously aren't for me due to interests, though I still get a lot of misfires because some books just turn out to not go through.

I used to think of getting a book that hits like my book, the one I'm writing, so I can be inspired, but I haven't had much luck on that part and I'm now considering an alternative of just reading for fun. But I really wanna ask how I can find the right book to pick up in my hand and read because It gets kind of hard, and what other places to ask it other than the r/books Reddit itself.

"I finished reading the Harry Potter series to my boys (8 &amp; 9), which incidentally took forever but they loved, and we decided to start with The Hobbit and then move on to Lord of the Rings. They are pretty avid readers and constantly beg for stories so I try to have something to read several nights a week. They found parts of HP quite funny, certainly more so than a lot of the other stuff we've read.

Anyway, I either don't remember reading the Hobbit at that age, or I first read it when I was a teenager, so I was shocked to discover that they find it genuinely funny. I know it's a children's book but I remembered it being an adventure story. Obviously there are exciting adventures and what not where they aren't laughing, but several times a chapter they are cracking up at people complaining about being hungry, tripping to avoid death, trying to stay asleep, tricking people, getting stuck in doors, etc. They particularly love the songs (they find the lyrics hilarious). Maybe they're just the right age to really appreciate it or that first chapter with dwarves threatening to break dishes and a flustered Bilbo really set the tone. They've been keeping me amused, although thankfully the story is well-written enough (some children's books are absolutely dire to read as an adult) that I don't mind reading it regardless.

Anyone else experience books that you didn't realize/remember were funny when you read it, but turned out to hit the sweet spot for a younger age group?",books,1494
"Hi,
when I was in 5th grade, our teacher read us a really (at that age) disturbing book. It was so strange. But I never heard the ending. But it left such a vivid memory of the story (or the picture my mind painted), I‚Äôd love to find this book. 

The only things I remember are:
- probably a children‚Äôs book
- written at least 12 years ago
- The story was about a little boy who drew a picture - a house with somebody in it. But when he fell asleep (or something like that, I don‚Äôt remember) he actually visited his drawing and talked with the boy there. Then he added more stuff to the picture (like stones with ‚Äúeyes‚Äù to monitor the boy), when he was upset or when he wanted to play. 

That‚Äôs about it. Guys, so you have any ideas?",books,733
"Basically the title. We all know the typical books people always say like ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" or other books everyone already knows about.

But, what are some books you have read that literally have changed your life that many don't know about or aren't super well known? When I say changed your life, I mean in a big way. 

Either they made you more productive in life, they changed the trajectory of your life by teaching you a technique to fix your life, or something similar.

The only key thing is the book needs to be non-fiction, somewhat related to trying to teach people to improve their lives, and not a book that everyone knows or is stereo-typically said when this question is asked.",books,717
"Recently discovered I have aphantasia (inability to visualize mental imagery) and it really freaked me out realizing that my brain really is empty most of the time.

"Howdy /r/books! First of all, a collective thanks to the many folks here who've recommended this book over time. I never got assigned to read it in school, and I've finally picked it up in my late 20s in an attempt to divert from my usual reading of superhero/mystery/adventure novels, and read something that's closer to ""classic literature"" but still has an adventurous feeling.

On to my question, though: in the version I'm reading, which I got from Project Gutenberg, there are these numbers with an ""m"" at the end where other books might have a scene or paragraph break. At first I thought these were minutes, like we were going to know exactly how much time passed between the start and end of the story. But now it's clear that that isn't the case, and I'm left wondering what they are? Is it a French literary thing? Is it something to do with the serialized publication of the original?

"Hello smart people of r/books,

I need your help!

I'm looking for a novel series set in the UK. I listened to the audio books a while ago, but lost the files and can't remember the titles. The series was published during the 2000s and 2010s.
Some details I can remember:

Setting:

Post-apocalypse, post-pandemic. 
The majority of mankind was whiped out by a plague. The story follows a rag-tag group of survivors from the pov of some of the main characters.

Main characters I can remember:
Male police officer, former soldier. During the first book, he teams up, among others, with a teenage girl and a truck mechanic, also former military.
The police officer drives a Land Rover and has a German Shepard dog.
In book one, the group establishes a home base on a farm called ""Sanctuary"".

Spoilers: 

&gt;!At some point, the survivors realize that at some point in their live they either contracted or were vaccinated against Malaria!&lt;

&gt;!The new plague also affects unborn children. All pregnat women of the group either have miscarriages or the baby's are stillborn. A small group journeys to France to find a cure.!&lt;",books,1130

"I have got very few contacts, almost negligible, who read. I frankly think none of my friends has ever read a book passionately in their life, even if they claim to have read one. I always feel sad about this, more for them, because they are missing a great enjoyment of their life. But this time, I feel bad for myself.

I always feel lonely after completing a book(not that I don't enjoy it), but after having enjoyed that alone time I really feel the urge to discuss it with some acquaintance - my emotions, the author, the characters. I've almost completed Pride&amp;Prejudice, and it's affecting me in a rather different manner.

Normally I overthink about the characters and the plot and how it would have been but this time, Darcy's character and Elizabeth's attitude feels something diiferent to me. Maybe it's because this is the first time I'm reading a novel of manners and Austen's writing style is hitting me differently.. but did any of you feel the same way?

this book by S. Craig Zahler was scheduled to be released months ago but it never happened.

"Hi everyone,

Sometime last month I saw a post from this subreddit on the popular screen talking about how they only watched the Lord of the Rings movies and how the books vastly expanded the story. So I thought, why not, I love fantasy books and decided I would start from the beginning of the series when I could. Jump to last week, my wife and I head to B&amp;N and pick up a few books. I headed straight to the sci-fi and fantasy section as usual and found the LOTR section. I picked up a copy of the Silmarillion among a few other books and headed out (obviously stopping by the board game selection before leaving).

Jump to 3 nights ago, I was sitting in bed reading and my wife was saying she was having a really tough time going to sleep and I said I could read to her. As a note, my wife doesn't prefer the time dedicated to world building that I enjoy, which is basically all of the Silmarillion for as far as I've gotten. So I started reading to her and about a chapter later she was out like a light.

So for the last couple of nights, our night time procedure has been to get ready for bed then for her to tell me to grab the book and start reading and I've got to say... It is an awesome feeling.  I plan to only read it before bed so I can make this last as long as possible.",books,1291

I recommend you to read this series as it's my personal favorite!!
It's every book includes different action and adventure...

Young bond series is one of the best non-fiction/spy genre series that I have ever known. It's story is based on the great detective we have ever known ""The James Bond....""

As we know, it is based on fictional character so it is not an autobiography. It is written by Charlie  Higson.
Following a treacherous rescue mission in the freezing Alps, James Bond is preparing for life back at Eton. But James's every move is being watched.He alone holds clue to a sinister plot that will bring bloodshed and carnage to his school and his country... Soon he is trapped in a deadly war of secrets and lies...

It's somewhat like the Alex rider series... but in very simple language that even 10th standard student can also understand.",books,855

"It seems reasonable to agree on the point that not all books are for everybody and that if you aren't ""into"" a book (if the subject matter or story or style of writing doesn't excite you, doesn't interest you and make you want to keep reading) you won't get much out of it regardless if you force yourself to finish it or not. If you don't at all see how the ramblings and musings of a middle-class Frenchman from the early 20th century are relevant to you and the character altogether bores you, you *can* bite it and just go through the entirety of Remembrance of Things Past, but I think we can all agree that you'll get as much out of it as you would from reading a summary of the book. Reading the Iliad and hating every second of it sounds about as good a way to spend your free time as watching the Brad Pitt movie - at least the latter ends more quickly.

Should you still force yourself to finish everything you pick up nonetheless? Do you do that? Is there a difference in your tendency to abandon books when it comes to different kinds of books? For example, are you more likely to abandon a 2020 genre novel than you are to give up on an old classic that is universally hailed as being very important, influential, masterfully written, etc? There are also some books you *have* to finish - a textbook for a course you're taking isn't always going to be pleasing and exciting, but you'll plod through it anyway. But would you take such an approach for things you read in your spare time, as a hobby?

And as an additional question: does it ever worry you that you'll never get around to reading some books? I don't like reading ancient classics, epics, and myths for example - the style of writing and storytelling seem alien to me, and the prospect of stopping every sentence to read a footnote or to read along with a commentary on what some phrase or expression or plot point means simply kills the entire experience for me. Yet, it does bother me that I'm in my mid-20s now and have not even begun to appreciate any of those supposed cultural milestones and I don't see how at any point some light will go in my head that makes me excited by how some guy gets turned into a donkey and then what follows are a hundred pages of completely unrelated stories about secondary characters. Do you think that it's a good approach to just read voraciously whatever I *can* read voraciously and leave whatever I *can't* for a point in time where the desire to do so is sparked? Older readers: did you ever get to a point where your interests bred other interests, i. e. when all you wanted to read was contemporary literature or genre fiction and at some point you just developed the curiosity to expand into older movements and styles?",books,2741
"Hi everyone,

I just re-discovered the joy of reading, especially book series because I always liked big works.

I am currently reading book 3 of the expanse. I like the series so far and planning to finish it. As a fantasy lover, I am also planning to read the Cosmere books.

"Imagine an entrepreneur who wakes up at 4 am. He heads to the gym, listening to an audiobook on his 30-minute commute, levelling-up and feeding his brain with new information. He completes a 45-minute workout, then a sauna session to get in peak state keeping the mind sharp for the day ahead. He showers and heads to the office, again listening to an audiobook, gaining insights, arriving at the office at 7 am. He dives straight into deep work on the activities that really matter. No checking emails, no distractions, just laser-like focus on the task at hand. 9 am comes around, two hours have flown by as he‚Äôs been in a deep, focussed and uninterrupted state. He stops for 20 minutes to have a packed breakfast and grab a coffee.  
It‚Äôs now 9:20 am, and he‚Äôs back at his desk, jumping straight back into deep work on highly-leveraged activities that will move the business forward. Another two hours go by, it‚Äôs 11:20 am. He hops inside his inbox, archiving and deleting emails that don‚Äôt need a reply, actioning others with short, sharp responses, or simply jumping on the phone for two minutes to sort out an issue that would take 20 minutes to deal with via email. By this time it‚Äôs 12 pm and he‚Äôs already done four hours of solid productive, proactive ‚Äòmove the needle‚Äô work. Already twice what the other entrepreneur completed in a whole day, and it‚Äôs still only lunchtime.  
He has a healthy lunch and turns off the brain to recover and decompress. It‚Äôs now 12:45 pm, and he‚Äôs back at his desk, refreshed and raring to go. There are a few pressing issues that take an hour and 15 minutes to resolve before he‚Äôs able to get back to the work that really matters. It‚Äôs now 2 pm and he gets in another two hours of deep work. Writing sales letters, coming up with new offers, creating new products, forming new strategic partnerships ‚Äì whatever they might be.   
It‚Äôs now 4 pm and time to head home to beat the traffic and see his kids. Again, audiobook on, constantly feeding the brain. Arriving home to play with the kids, bathe them, have dinner. It‚Äôs now 6:30 pm, and he picks up a book written by a proven master in their field on a subject he is looking to improve in his own business. Reading for an hour and a half, again training. It‚Äôs 8 pm before he puts on Netflix or just goofs around with his partner and he‚Äôs in bed by 9:30 pm.  
Six hours of deep work. Two hours and 45 minutes of training and sharpening the axe. This adds up to eight hours and 45 minutes of work directed at becoming a master each day ‚Äì more than three times the other entrepreneur.  
Look at how much more training he‚Äôs able to do and how much more of the work that really matters. And it‚Äôs simply by starting at 4 am and being focussed. All this extra ground covered, and this doesn‚Äôt include the extra day he works on Sundays.  
As he keeps working, the years go on and the advantage he has over his competitors just gets wider and wider. Five years down the track and it really doesn‚Äôt matter how much work the competitor puts in over a given quarter, or if they don‚Äôt take holidays one year, because they‚Äôre five years behind.

"I want to share with you guys my favorite 3 books as a kid and probably one of my most nostalgic items.

It‚Äôs probably my favorite copy out of the 3 books because it‚Äôs an amazing hard cover with incredible artwork inside with a nice hand written message. The second book Zlateh The Goat was also his original copy from when he was a kid but sadly it has no handwritten message, the book itself is king of falling apart at this point but I can‚Äôt help and flip it to see the wonderful drawings it has inside and chuckle at some of the short stories.

"The world building is fantastic in both‚Äîperhaps JK‚Äôs best skill as an author. 

And while some of her characters are iconic, many (the non-white ones in particular) are inexcusably flat. 

Terry built a world that included all sorts and never wrote a single character that wasn‚Äôt fully realized. I mean THE SUITCASE had more personality than Cho or the Patels. 

His plots were wonderfully layered and used historic references and settings to tell poignantly modern tales that never failed to recognize the humanity in all people. (And didn‚Äôt passively teach children to avoid going to adults for help when they were in trouble: My mother‚Äôs major issue with the series when I was young.)

Also Terry was one of the best when it came to writing women‚Äîespecially for a man. I say this as someone who has read too many slightly-altered carbon copies of the same un-realized female character to not appreciate this. 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, even though JK has some bullshit opinions and I probably won‚Äôt be reading her in the future, I looove/d HP like a lot of the rest of the world. But as time passes I‚Äôm more sad we‚Äôll never get another Diskworld book than I would be if we never got another HP book.

"  

I discovered that I had a big appetite for reading in late high school, and spent a few years holed up in libraries. I thought I wanted to teach, but when I got some college research grants, I found out that my long term retention of the stuff I was learning was pretty poor, and it seemed infeasible to me at the time to pursue a career in academia.

Spent several years living life instead: odd jobs, bars, road trips, outdoor sports, etc. etc. a.k.a. being in my 20s. About three years ago I clued into the fact that my reading retention had been so poor because I had four classes at any given time plus a social life, and that I was just too overfilled with new stuff in order to be able to get any of it to stick. My long term retention was actually pretty good if I made sure that I ""got"" what I was reading, which finally made me feel like reading was a worthwhile passion again.

This ""retention pace"" is for me really really slow, because I underline a lot and write a ton of marginalia. I have had a lot of free time in the past few years, which has allowed me to read quite a lot of books and fill six or seven medium-sized journals. But the pace is *slow* (a 400 page book can take me five days of sunup to sundown reading).

This kind of thinking is great, because it allows me to remember what the books I have read were actually about. But it has basically lobotomized by ability to have the kind of fast-paced, charming conversations that used to make me good at socializing. (I mean, I was kind of an alcoholic and probably mostly said dumb things, but I was light enough on my feet to regularly make bright people laugh.)

Moreover, I can‚Äôt even talk about the books I‚Äôve read to other people, because I read them with my ‚Äúslow brain‚Äù and in order to talk about them interestingly in a conversation I have to somehow translate those memories for my ‚Äúfast brain‚Äù‚Ä¶ which is wicked hard. So there is now a great divide between the reading and writing part of my life, which is most all of it these days, and my social personality.  I paradoxically come across as much *duller* now, although I certainly think more insightfully.

I am not really sure how to integrate the ability to think intentionally with the ability to converse.  It is all well and fine to have a library tucked away in the back of my head somewhere, but it takes so much time and effort to extract the nuggets from that library into types of thought which I can actually *use* in daily life that it feels not worth the effort to develop it.  It would be such a marvelous trick to be able to synthesize conversation on the fly with all of those thoughts, to have my reading influence my relationships and not to be just for me, just when I am alone.

Does anybody have any experience with this problem?  Thanks for reading. :)",books,2816
"As an adult, I regularly read prose (mostly non-fiction for leisure), but probably haven't picked up poetry since high school twenty years ago.  Just wanted ""I'm Thinking of Ending Things"" on Netflix and there's a scene with a long poem being recited in a car (""Bonedog"" by Eva H.D.).  I liked the poem and it piqued my interest enough to give some poetry a try, but I feel like I don't know enough about poetry to even know where to start. I vaguely recall from high school that I prefer poetry that has a lyrical quality to it and paints a picture, but that is relatively straightforward to read.  I'm not that keen on obtuse stuff that takes a lot to unpack (T.S. Eliot) or that use weird sentence structure.  Any suggestions for a gateway collection of poems to give  a shot to see if I like the genre or not?

"Known to friends and foes alike as Bill, Veeck was one of the most daring and original team owners in baseball. He's infamous for the zany promotions and literal circuses he put on at the ballpark. His antics included giving away live animals to (un)lucky fans, a 'Disco Demolition' night, and signing a little person, Eddie Gaedel, to his St. Louis Browns team. The stories here are as much about marketing as they are baseball; despite being considered crazy, and possibly insane, by his peers he consistently proved his genius by setting attendance records and building winning teams. Many people say that Veeck likes to embellish and uses hyperbole while spinning his yarns, but unless you have a stick up your ass about historical accuracy you'll forgive him for the good humor he brings to the table. The best thing about Veeck is that he is an honorable guy who got into the business because he connected to and cared about the average baseball fan. There are just as many stories about his charitable acts as there are about his shenanigans.

I'm up to chapter 12, roughly half way in. Can anyone who's finished this book tell me that it gets better? I've never felt the need to quit a book before.",books,789
"This story takes place WWAAYY back in 1994 and in 2002, but I thought you all would get a laugh out of it.

I was a junior in high school at the time and grew up in Orange County where Mr. Koontz lives as well. I'd never run into him but I'd read all of his books and knew that he lived in the area.

Well, one day, in early May, my friends and I were at the beach. They were swimming but I was lying on our blankets reading Mr. Koontz's latest novel when a man approaches me and strikes up a conversation.

M = M SM = Strange Man

SM - ""Hi, I hope I""m not intruding but I see your reading Dean Koontz's newest novel. How are you liking it? I love his books!""

M = (young, naive, and seeing nothing wrong with chatting about books with a stranger on a crowded beach) ""Oh, I'm liking it so far. I've read everything he's written though and I don't think I've disliked a single one!""

SM - ""Really? What would you say was your favorite? I, personally, liked Lightening the best. I found the way he handled time travel really interesting"".

M = ""That's actually my second favorite. My favorite is 'Watchers', I loved the dynamic with Einstein and it had a really 'real world' feel despite being a work of fiction.""

SM - ""Yes, that one was good too. Well, I'll have to give this one a try. Again, I'm sorry for intruding.""

M - ""That's ok, have a nice day!""

He walked off and, as he did I see my friends rushing towards me all excited. They start asking me a million questions about SM and our conversation. I, literally, have no clue why the are so excited about some random conversation with a stranger. Finally, they realize I'm completely lost and tell me to turn over my book. Yep, you got it, I'd been talking to Dean Koontz and hadn't even realized it!!! I guess I just figured that since he's a really famous author from the area it wasn't surprising that someone would stop to talk about his books. I've done that to people before too! Of course I jump and start to run down the boardwalk in the direction he'd wandered off in but, of course, I didn't find him. RATS!

Fast forward to 2002:

My mom calls me from California and tells me she has the biggest surprise for me! She went to a book signing and got me a signed copy of Dean Koontz's newest book, she also said that the signature would really blow me away. However, she would not tell me anything further.

The book comes in the mail, I open it and there's the inscription ""To Kristy, I really enjoyed our conversation on the beach. It was very refreshing. Sincerely, Dean Koontz.""

Mom told me later that, when she reached him, she had told him her daughter was a big fan and that, if he had a moment she had a quick little anecdote for him. She then starts to tell him about my time on the beach but, apparently, he cut her off and said ""Wait, I remember this! That was your daughter?"" My mom was stunned as that had been 8 years ago and she just stared at him and said ""Yes, but how can you possible remember that?"" His response warms my heart to this day. He said ""I remember her because she didn't treat me like anyone special, she just treated me like a regular person and I really loved that!"" Mom then had to burst his bubble and tell him that, in all honesty, the only reason I'd treated him normally was because I'd had no damn idea who he was until AFTER he'd walked away! She told me that he just about died laughing and said that that was story he'd be telling for ages, then he signed me book and Mom walked away. I still have that book, of course.",books,3528
"So, some necessary context for this: I'm in a Literary Studies PhD program, and last week I took my comprehensive exams. While I won't know for a few days longer whether I passed or not (crossing every finger over here), one thing I already know is that I'll likely never go through a period of such intense reading in my life as I did this summer. It was both exhausting and rewarding, and that kind of reading experience is worth an entirely separate thread in its own right.

Anyway, one of my three reading lists was focused exclusively on Cormac McCarthy. I had previously read four of his novels, but over the course of the summer I read everything he's written - and I mean *everything*. All ten novels, the four dramatic works, the handful of early short stories that are still readily available, the tiny handful of public intellectual pieces he's done in the past few years with the Santa Fe Institute (this last category is really just one essay, but it counts!). They were all accompanied by a healthy dose of scholarship, both literary criticism specifically about McCarthy and larger historical/theoretical works that could be applied to discussing his books. Now that the dust of comps has settled and I don't have to wear my academic hat for a few days, I thought coming to this sub and writing about it might be enjoyable to y'all (and help me collect my own thoughts, too!). I've kept this post spoiler-free for the benefit of anyone who hasn't read him, but has been considering giving him a go.

**The Good**

Most of McCarthy's novels really are worth your time. The lack of quotation marks around dialogue really threw me for a loop the first time I read him (*The Road*, about ten years ago), but once you get the rhythm of his speakers down, he just sweeps you away. I think he writes some of the best action scenes in fiction - *Blood Meridian* has some absolutely wild gunfights. His work has a pretty deserved reputation for being brutally violent (see ""The Ugly"" below), but *The Orchard Keeper* and *All the Pretty Horses* are pretty tame, so maybe give one of them a go if you're interested but nervous about the darker novels.

Thematically, McCarthy is really into borders, maps, and territorial ownership. I don't want to veer too far into the theoretical weeds (I already wrote that essay for my exams) but there are a lot of really interesting philosophical questions raised in his work about where we ""draw the line,"" both in terms of geopolitical space and personal choice. *The Crossing* is particularly heavy on those sorts of meditations, but it comes up in pretty much everything he writes, probably because most of his protagonists are young vagrants or runaways. Next time you're up a book that you really want to chew on and think through, keep him in mind.

I highly recommend any of *Blood Meridian*, *All the Pretty Horses*, *The Road,* or *The Sunset Limited* (his ""novel in dramatic form"" - a literal dialogue) to anyone who wants to dip their toes in his work. *No Country for Old Men* is also good, but honestly, I think the film makes just the right changes to a couple crucial details and edges it out. If you like *All the Pretty Horses*, then reading the rest of the Border Trilogy (*The Crossing* and *Cities of the Plain*) makes sense, but be aware that each of the three books is very different tonally and *Horses* is easily the most fun adventure in McCarthy's work. *The Orchard Keeper* is his first novel and shows some of that ""debut author"" roughness around the edges, so I wouldn't necessarily recommend it as a first choice, but if you like his other work, it's fun to see the novel that started it all.

**The Bad**

McCarthy isn't even a tenth of the (screen)playwright that he is a novelist. He has four dramatic works - *The Gardener's Son, The Stonemason, The Sunset Limited,* and *The Counselor* \- and only one of them is worth your time. Ironically, that work, *The Sunset Limited,* is written in a pseudo-novel form, so it ends up being a borderline case. I hear the film version of *The Gardener's Son* is good and I meant to watch it this summer, but alas, I ran out of time; reading the screenplay is an exercise in confusion, since McCarthy wrote it while roadtripping with the film's director and didn't need to include important stuff like basic setting description because his co-creator already knew that stuff. I remember liking *The Stonemason* as I read it, but I can't recall a single thing happened as I write this, so clearly it didn't make the impression a good work should. As for *The Counselor* \- well, let's just not.

Some of his common tropes and concerns do show their age. As I was reading and occasionally chiming in to my partner about things, she'd sometimes ask, ""So, has a woman shown up yet?"" If you're looking for books with strong female characters or are really tired of reading American men wax poetic about masculinity, then McCarthy almost certainly will not pass muster in your eyes. Several of his books are virtually womanless, only one of them has a female protagonist (the infuriatingly naive Rinthy Holme of his second novel, *Outer Dark*), and he commits a few pretty egregious fridgings. Similarly, some of the later works - *No Country* and *The Road*, in particular - are really, *really* heavy with the hand-wringing about getting older and seeing the country fall apart, which can come off as an old man grousing about the kids on his lawn. For my part, neither of these ruined the experience for me, but I recognize that they might not sit well with other folks.

Also, I really, *really* cannot recommend *Suttree*, his fourth novel, for any reason. It's an overstuffed exercise in bad scenic prose poetry - mostly of scenes describing how badly polluted the Tennessee River was in Knoxville in the 1950s. Perhaps it was a casualty of the reading context, since I didn't really have the time to luxuriate in its big poetic passages, but considering the subject matter of those passages, I'm not sure it would've been a pleasant experience.

**The Ugly**

McCarthy has more than earned his reputation as a writer of terrible violence, and that can be pretty stomach churning for folks that don't have the tolerance for it. *Blood Meridian* is easily the most violent, but *The Road* can get pretty hairy, too.

And then, there's *Outer Dark* and *Child of God*.

I want to recommend *Child of God* to you, I really do, and I was skeptical going into *Outer Dark* because I've tried to read it before and failed a few times, but in the end, I actually liked it more than I expected. But, here's the thing with both of them: They're not just violent, they're *gross*. Both detail pretty upsetting sexual crimes, there's a lot of bodily functions on the page (*Child of God* spends a whole early paragraph describing its main character pooping), and the protagonists of both books are almost impossibly dense caricatures of Southern and Appalachian redneck/hick stereotypes. I have a really high threshold for the Southern Gothic exaggeration of things, and even I found a few scenes in each book to be...a lot. Of all his books, these are the two that pose the greatest challenge to the reader's taste. Definitely don't pick them up lightly.

\---

And that's that! I'd love to hear what other folks have felt about McCarthy, or if you were on the fence and my crash course helped you decide if he sounds up your alley =)",books,7443

Though the plot of the book and author have completely escaped my memories, I was hoping if someone would know of the books that I speak of.

"I can understand that a pseudonym creates this sense of anonymity, where the publishing author may feel like people are buying his/her books because of a famous name. Even though this holds true, I assume that -- with help of the internet -- most people who read an author's pseudonym book do so because they already know who is behind it. It's not even a secret, most of the time. For example, Rowling's pseudonym Robert Galbraith published a book named ""Troubled Blood"" and the majority already knows it is her. The media also has picked up on it and is reporting about the actual woman behind Robert Galbraith. So why create this pseudonym, if you're not even trying to keep it anonymous.",books,691

I read a book back in elementary school and it was really my introduction to enjoying reading as I was an undiagnosed dyslexic and reading at that age was a struggle. It was a shorter book probably only a 100 pages or so. It was about three siblings that had to fly alone (I forget the reason their mom couldn‚Äôt come with them) and the plane started going down and the three siblings kind of woke up in this alternate world. Crows would follow them and signal when something bad was about to happen. The youngest sibling kept dimes taped to the inside of her shoe. (Spoiler alert) At the end we find out that the plane they were on crashed in a field and these kids were unconscious but the only survivors. It‚Äôs left unclear if the alternate world was a shared dream between the siblings as they all remember it or some sort of place in between life and death.

"Thinking on the fuss that people are making about J.K.Rowling, I'm reminded of my mother. As a freelance writer, she once was asked to write an EFL book to explain the Gulf War (the first one) to children. She did. It was well-liked by the publisher, except for one detail: she mentioned *how* the oil was spilled from the Kuwaiti oil wells and *who* did made it happen. She was forced to change the book so that the relevant passage read, in part, ""Some oil was spilled during the conflict."" This, she was told, was to ensure that the publishing house's Middle Eastern partners would be able to sell the book to local schools and to the parents of young children.

While I understand the reasoning, I also understand why she was a bit put out. As I recall, a colleague jested that Mum ought to write a book, ""Mohammad, Prophet of Allah, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_s a small disabled \_\_\_\_\_\_,"" and submit it to the publishing house, to prove a point. Although I'm glad she didn't, I can empathize.

"I see a lot of praise on this sub about Orwell, but it never really goes beyond his two flagship books, like Animal Farm and ESPECIALLY 1984. I get that these are widely read and widely taught in high school; however, I would argue his other books are far better, and I made this post to point them out/recommend a few standouts:

\*\*Shooting An Elephant\*\*: this collection of essays is fantastic. The title essay is a brutal and harrowing look at Orwell's time being a police officer in Burma. Some of his best writing ever.

\*\*Homage To Catalonia\*\*: an incredible piece of nonfiction about Orwell fighting in the Spanish Civil War. A classic of leftist literature and a thrilling book in its own right as well.

\*\*Keep The Aspidistria Flying\*\*: easily one of his funniest books, it's a phenomenal satirical novel of a man living in 1930s Britain who attempts to eschew material goods. If you like Joseph Heller, this is a must read.

Really all of his writing is fantastic. This is, in my view, a great primer for one of the most talented and insightful authors of the early 20th century. Happy reading!",books,1116

"I always used to love reading as a kid. As I‚Äôve gotten older it‚Äôs something I almost never do. At the start of the pandemic I was resolute in starting to reading again. One of my goals was to read classic literature that I probably should‚Äôve read a long time ago. My first stop was Crime and Punishment and I‚Äôm ashamed it‚Äôs taken me this long. 

This is one of the best books I‚Äôve ever read in my entire life. I found myself wanting to give up on it during Part 1 and Part 2. The internal dialogue sometimes felt like it would go on forever. I would occasionally feel that we were taking a look into the lives of other characters that were just ‚Äúfluff‚Äù. The more I stuck with it the more I realized it was not the case. Every character had a unique and important purpose that either served the main character, or the moral/philosophical takeaways.

Raskilinikov‚Äôs mental state is such a key aspect of the book. It‚Äôs a constant battle of anxiety and depression yet his actual crime fits neatly between the two of them. 

By the end I absolutely loved every single character. They all had depth and purpose. Raskilinikov‚Äôs gloom and melancholy became my own, but so did his hope for the future.

Here are some of the notes I took. Mostly quotes I liked. Either for their philosophical implications or how it relates to the current state of the world.

Chapter 1 &gt; Page 6
‚ÄúAnd how could such an atrocious thing come into my head? What filthy things my heart is capable of. Yes, filthy above all, disgusting, loathsome, loathsome!‚Äî and for a whole month I‚Äôve been...‚Äù But no words, no exclamations, could express his agitation.

As humans, I think we all have had thoughts at one time or another that match up to the feelings this quote embodies.

‚ÄúAll that‚Äôs nonsense,‚Äù he said hopefully, ‚Äúand there is nothing in it all to worry about! It‚Äôs simply physical derangement. Just a glass of beer, a piece of dry bread‚Äî and in one moment the brain is stronger, the mind is clearer and the will is firm! Phew, how utterly petty it all is!‚Äù

Chapter 2 &gt; Page 9
I try to find sympathy and feeling in drink... I drink so that I may suffer twice as much!‚Äù

This represents feelings towards drugs and alcohol that people may not understand. They use to feel different, but may end up feeling twice as bad as they did before.

Chapter 2 &gt; Page 12
Do you suppose, you that sell, that this pint of yours has been sweet to me? It was tribulation I sought at the bottom of it, tears and tribulation, and have found it, and I have tasted it; but He will pity us Who has had pity on all men, Who has understood all men and all things, He is the One, He too is the judge.

‚Äùaccept one‚Äôs lot humbly as it is, once for all and stifle everything in oneself, giving up all claim to activity, life and love!‚Äù

He ate a little, three or four spoonfuls, without appetite, as it were mechanically. His head ached less.

Meanwhile it would seem, as regards the moral question, that his analysis was complete; his casuistry had become keen as a razor, and he could not find rational objections in himself.

Chapter 6 &gt; Page 35
It was his conviction that this eclipse of reason and failure of will power attacked a man like a disease, developed gradually and reached its highest point just before the perpetration of the crime, continued with equal violence at the moment of the crime and for longer or shorter time after, according to the individual case, and then passed off like any other disease. The question whether the disease gives rise to the crime, or whether the crime from its own peculiar nature is always accompanied by something of the nature of disease, he did not yet feel able to decide.

‚ÄòCatch several hares and you won‚Äôt catch one.‚Äô Science now tells us, love yourself before all men, for everything in the world rests on self-interest.

This is representative of the foundation of American morals. The next quote explains it‚Äôs benefit to society.

Chapter 5 &gt; Page 73
Economic truth adds that the better private affairs are organised in society‚Äîthe more whole coats, so to say‚Äîthe firmer are its foundations and the better is the common welfare organised too.

I love this because it reminds me of the greatness of America. If everyone focused on themselves to the point that you are a better person, we will live in a better society.

That‚Äôs man‚Äôs one privilege over all creation. Through error you come to the truth! I am a man because I err! You never reach any truth without making fourteen mistakes and very likely a hundred and fourteen.

They don‚Äôt recognise that humanity, developing by a historical living process, will become at last a normal society, but they believe that a social system that has come out of some mathematical brain is going to organise all humanity at once and make it just and sinless in an instant, quicker than any living process! That‚Äôs why they instinctively dislike history, ‚Äònothing but ugliness and stupidity in it,‚Äô and they explain it all as stupidity! That‚Äôs why they so dislike the living process of life; they don‚Äôt want a living soul! The living soul demands life, the soul won‚Äôt obey the rules of mechanics, the soul is an object of suspicion, the soul is retrograde! But what they want though it smells of death and can be made of India-rubber, at least is not alive, has no will, is servile and won‚Äôt revolt!

‚ÄúWhat do you mean by ‚Äòmore honourable‚Äô? I don‚Äôt understand such expressions to describe human activity. ‚ÄòMore honourable,‚Äô‚Äònobler‚Äô‚Äîall those are old-fashioned prejudices which I reject. Everything which is of use to mankind is honourable. I only understand one word: useful! You can snigger as much as you like, but that‚Äôs so!‚Äù

I started a new podcast called ""Writing F(r)iction"" (available everywhere you listen to podcasts).

It's a weekly podcast with episodes of me rambling about my thoughts on the book world (i'm a published author) as well as interviews with other authors, publishers, agents, book store owners, etc...

The first 3 episodes are out now.

Give it a listen and please share if you dig it!

"There are very few autobiographies written by actual geniuses. And even fewer are actually interesting and well written. Books by Richard Feynman are one of these few. 

Bill Gates has called him ""The best teacher I never had"". An unusual character, Feynman was one of the scientists that worked on the atomic bomb.  If you're curious about what goes on in the mind of a genius, check out his book Surely You're Joking Mr. Feynman.",books,431
The book was about a teen boy's journey to take care of his younger brother and was released within the last decade or so. It was considered a hipster book because it dealt with existentialism and I do remember them renting a room in an apartment together and not having money for food.

I'll try to read but every time I'm interrupted it pulls me out of the book and I don't enjoy having to coming in and out of the story. So I give up. Even in the evenings I feel too tired to get into reading something intense and even then the baby could interrupt me. Looking for lighthearted easy books to try to get back into it. I like a decent range of books. Sci-fi, fantasy, romance, dramas, mysterys Not really sure what I'm looking for but I used to be quite the bibliophile and I miss it.",books,624

"I am a huge introvent , i have trouble connecting with people , but when i read a book i empathize more with the characters and less with people in real life.

Hey there. No one around me immediately is interested in talking about military history. Let alone books that deal with government given COVID and current daily news trends. But I've been catching up with reading stuff by Annie Jacobson and she's becoming my new favorite non-fiction author. I finished Surprise Kill Vanish last month and working on The Pentagon's Brain right now. The experience or reading her stuff has been good so far. The neutral but necessary perspectives she takes on declassified military history of the united states is one I might not have sought out if I wasn't reading her books. Not really looking for other book recommendation to read at the moment just interested if anyone want to share their opinion on her work or similarly related books in the same theme.,books,791
"Sarah Vaughn is a wonderful writer and fiction should have great freedom in plot drivers, but it feels intentionally harmful when you use a mental condition that is under remedied and over vilified and then ghost it.
My reaction was the same as it would be if a character was portrayed as having Autism and all the challenges and then the ending is ""it was actually a virus and it's over"". You devalue the person, the struggle; and take away hope that there is an endurable outcome.
This heart my heart.
Most people who have issues with parenting boundaries are repeating the conditions they experienced and have deep emotional roots beyond right and wrong.
Thins story does nothing to make the subject easier to approach, discuss or remedy as fiction often does.
The twist ending is a dishonorable denial of the human condition.",books,829
I bought this book because of how interesting it looked. It also looked like Sherlock Holmes Red tower which I liked. I finished this book and I have to say It was quite disappointing. A book was way longer then it was suppose to be. The story was really slow which that was another problem I had. Harry Potter is like the same page length but harry potter makes the story more fast paste. Its a mystery book but I didn't feel suspense. I found the characters in this book bland and forgettable. I think this books cover is really good. This book isn't underrated neither overrated. I recommenced Sherlock Holmes Red tower over this book. From a rating scale from 1-10 i would give this book a 3/10 In sorry I just didn't like this book. It was boring with bland characters.,books,774

"I picked it up at my local thrift shop for 1‚Ç¨ and have read it over the past month and a half as my first Tom Clancy book because it was the only one available at that moment. After having heard quite a lot of negative reviews I decided to give my own thoughts in.

First of all, it is a good book, I seriously like the plot and how the parts are distributed. The problems I have with it, however, are firstly, that the 200 pages or so at the beginning or so are basically just a way too long introduction to the story and could have easily been condensed to about 50%, the second problem is the fact that so many subplots are added in, which while actually adding to the story or even being essential to it could also be condensed to about 50%. As the last point, I really like the last 100 pages and Tom Clancy's Writing style, they redeem the book of its aforementioned flaws.

All in all, it's a solid book but it could have been far better if all the unnecessary ramble had been cut out. In my opinion, the book really should be only around 400 pages long. I still rate the book at a solid 7/10 despite its flaws.

Since I at least really liked the ending of the book and have heard that the rest of his books are only better, I have since bought a few others of his books from the same thrift shop and starting with ""The Hunt for Red October"" which I've only heard positive reviews of, I'll see how those are.",books,1415

I‚Äôm not sure if this is allowed here but I need some advice. Yesterday I was cleaning out an old tobacco barn on a farm property and found a copy of The Son of Tarzan from 1912. The pages are in good shape but the binding has fallen off.

" I recently finished George Eliot's Middlemarch and really liked it. In terms of observations on human nature, I think, the book is comparable to War and Peace or Anna Karenina. Some quotes in the book really seem to have stuck with me. Here is an example:

*Mary believed that things were not likely to be arranged for her peculiar satisfaction, she wasted no time in astonishment and annoyance at that fact.... She had already come to take life very much as* *a comedy, in which she had a proud resolution not to act mean or treacherous parts.*

"I am currently reading this essay in preparation for my degree and what she had to say about women's literature makes a lot of sense to me, though I can see how some of what she writes could be a little controversial. 

For those who haven't read it, her central argument seems to be that women need independence to be successful writers, both independence of thought and independence in their lives to live freely. And in the past, as they were never allowed to be independent by men, female authors were never able to reach their full potential as writers. They were only able to write within the limited scope of their own experience as they had virtually no opportunities to travel and gain more life experience as they were trapped in the perpetual cycle of marriage, kids, death. 

""One could not help but play for a moment with the thought of what might have happened if Charlotte Bronte...had somehow possessed more knowledge of the busy world, and towns and regions full of life; more practical experience, and intercourse with her kind and acquaintance with a variety of character...She knew, no one better, how enormously her genius would have profited""

"I would generally consider my English not to be very bad. I study the language and have been studying at a boarding school for a certain time. Now I have to say that when I examine group language skills, I see that they think in the language, have totally taken it, and subconsciously use it. I would love to get to that point. My English meets the standards of C1 with a tendency towards C2. To gain more fluidity and confidence with the language I would very much like to ask for your advice. Perhaps you can reflect on what has helped you and help you to use English at the level of speaking and writing. Thank you very much, I appreciate it.

What I probably need is a bit more time of exposure to the language) My brain and consciousnesses simply need more time to be completely accustomed to the language I am learning. Any advice on how to reach this?

Apart from that, I am deeming to enhance my French and get begun studying Spanish.

"Hey guys, I wanted to talk to some people whom have finished Piranesi by Susanna Clarke.

Only read this if you have finished it.

&amp;#x200B;

So, after reading this book I feel like I read a fantasy novel that actually maybe wasn't.  If that makes sense.

I got the distinct feeling in the end that we were just going through the mind of someone with split personality disorder among other disorders.

I get the feeling that number 16 is actually some kind of therapist and not a cop, that number 16 was working to bring him out of this disorder and into the real world.

The way it was described in the end where Piranesi was seeing people in the ""real world"" that he could link back to statues in the halls really started to make me think this even more.

I tried to read back through some stuff and I am either totally off base or Clarke really made sure to leave both avenues up for grabs.  Like its actually both things.  However you want to take it.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I the only one that feels this way?  Did everyone else just take this at face value?   Am I way off base?

So many questions come to mind, like the meaning of the birds in this scenario and why they came when they did.  I don't know.  What do you guys think?  Was this just a fantasy book where they did somehow find a way into these halls, or was this the mind of man suffering from mental health issues?

"Basically the title,

Maybe I am kinda confused because most of my life I have read only fantasy/scifi/horror genre and I am quite new in the ""literary"" waters, so I am not well versed in that world. Still I am kinda confused why are some books, that are made out of many smaller pieces (In search of a lost time, Dance to the music of time ... ) considered to be just one book.

My confusion comes out of the fact that many series that are not ""one book"" are sharing a narrative story, a characters, story arcs and so on, so it makes no sense that some books would be just part of the series while other are just pieces of one gigantic book.

So this is my question. Thank you for answering in advance. Have a wonderfull day.",books,726
"Has anybody else noticed this lately?

&amp;#x200B;

I just stopped by goodreads to give an arc I was received a rating. It was a good book. Like really good. Good worldbuilding, incredible writing style, pretty funny, but a story I expected would be super controversial and decisive, especially as it deals with themes (euthanasia, and unromanticised bdp and reality of war) that are not typical in general, let alone in the fantasy genre. So, to entertain myself, I decided to take a read through the bad reviews to see what people were saying... however, there were very few one-star reviews. Very odd, I thought. Clicked on the two-star reviews. Bingo. There were a few more in there, primarily one essay length review that HATED everything about both the story and writing. Even hated the formatting.  Clicked on three-stars, more bad reviews, including one who apparently dnf'd the book at 20%. How do you give a book you didn't even read a quarter of a 3\* review? That's like rating a restaurant because you liked the bottled water you brought there. This is also not the first time I've seen this behaviour lately as well.    

&amp;#x200B;

Why are people doing this? Is it because they're afraid the author is going to jump them if they give it a bad review? Is it because most of the rest of the reviews are 4-5 stars and they are too cowardice to deviate from the rest? What's going on in the review world.  Please, just rate your reviewers correctly. It makes it easier on those of us who read bad reviews for fun.",books,1528
"I was going through a bit of a tough time last year. I was on anti depressants, dealing with the death of a loved one and in pretty bad shape. On my birthday, a really good friend of mine got me The Magus. This book has had such a transformative role in my life. 

""The truth was I was not a cynic by nature, only by revolt. I had got away from what I hated, but I hadn't found where I loved, and so I pretended that there was nowhere to love. Handsomely equipped to fail, I went out into the world.""

I printed this quote and pasted it everywhere, as a reminder to myself. I needed to find something to love. And I did. I went back to school and joined a master's degree and I'm so much happier.

For the first time in a very long time, I feel like I have finally accomplished a goal that I had set out for myself. I feel great. The last book that I remember reading fully was an old Star Wars book before I'd joined the Army, and the rest of my life up to this point happened.

"I've been revisiting his works after almost twenty years by listening to them while I work.

His work contains the earliest examples of this that I've personally seen, especially in a rural American context. Did this exist before him? If so, does anyone have specific examples?

"A few weeks ago, I read 2 chapters and decided to stop for a few reasons: I was looking forward to Tolkienesque prose but Herbert writes in simple, plain language. There was a lack of description of the immediate environment, which left me wanting more for what they were wearing, what the rooms looked like, etc. I didn't like how the text is interjected with inner thoughts of characters.

Spoiler ahead.

But I decided to try again, so I restarted at page 1 and now I'm 24% in, about 150 pages, hoping things will get better. The prose and descriptions are still plain, but we have the stillsuits and the appearance of a sandworm, which are cool. I like the Duke. The inner thoughts I've come to accept as a fine way for seeing into the characters. Although there is a lot of shrugging. 

Should i soldier on? Do we get a thrilling sequence of running away desperately from sandworms? Immersive desert experience? Do we get to meet the Fremen and learn about their culture? Looking forward to things like that!

Well today I bought my first book(s). I went looking for one specifically, and ended up with five. 

Ashfall by Mike Mullin, The Catcher in the Rye, Crime and Punishment, The Giver, and another cool looking history book.

"I LOVED the first 3 books. But this one Idk. Im on page 170. The characters... i don't like them. That main guy is too much like an annoying version of Kelsier. A good hero who already knows everything, is a super fighter (omg that part where the police whispered surprised if he really killed them all alone with his buddy, that was so bad) he's just traumatized from his past. Ugh. Sry but its so typical. And it was already done with Kelsier in a better way. The woman, of course she's totally smart and oh! also knows how to fight, of course. But she's so cute and shy, what a nice proper woman lol. I guess I could get that, but i don't like the romance between them. Its so obvious. Maybe im biased but I miss the easy companionship between vin and the others. Here I basically only like Wayne and the woman who got kidnapped, she was funny. 

I also dont like the story so far. First thing is we are on the wrong side of the law :D it's like a romance crime novel. Also that rape story is definitely not my taste, it sounds even really stupid. They want to breed an army, honestly? The first books also spoke about rape but it fitted, here its done in such an primitiv and kind of unnecessary way.

I like the new world, but it feels strange that the people didn't changed one bit. Like they had an industrial revolution, but no social one. I mean ok, but that disappointed me.


So normally I have the rule to stop when I dont like a book after 50 pages. I'm already way over it, because I love the world so much and I'm waiting for it to get better. I want to know what everyone thinks of vin, sazed and the others. If there are still mistborn people and more about the new religions. So will thise things come? Or is it all just crime solving basically?

And I dont want to bash the people who liked the new books, I just wanted to write down what I dislike to see if it changes. So it would be great if someone could maybe give me their opinion. Or also why you like it, i really want to like it too...",books,2013

"Read 13¬†books since the beginning of quarantine and really wanted to share them with you and what I thought (briefly) about each one.


**1 - Brave New World by Aldous Huxley:** The last book I had read before my year long break was 1984, since it turned out to be one of my favourite books I decided to pick up another one of the dystopian classics. The contrast between these two books was astonishing. Absolutely loved Huxley's satirical writing. The obsession with¬†consumerism and materialism, and the people's clear lack of distiction between sensational pleasures and happiness is eerily familiar.

**2 - Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury:** Another classic dystopia. I'm dissappointed to say that I haven't enjoyed this one as much as I did 1984 and BNW. The message of the book kind of seemed forced and I didn't feel engaged at all with the characters.

**3 - Animal Farm by George Orwell:** Basically the ""explain like im five"" version of the russian revolution, which I really appreciated since my history knowledge really needs major refining.

**4 - Night by Elie Wiesel:** This was one of my first non-fiction books. It's an autobiographical account of Elie Wiesel's experience in the Nazi concentration camps. Horrifying beyond words. Very eye opening. I honestly do not know what to say about it except that after reading it, it's clear to me¬†there's almost no limit to the suffering a human can endure.

**5 - Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor E. Frankl:** This book is what taught me, among many things, how people can find purpose and meaning in their suffering which I thought was beautiful, especially being delivered from a Viktor E. Frankl, a psychologist who experienced and survived the camps.

**6 - Flow by¬†mihaly csikszentmihalyi:** This book truly changed my perspective on the phrase ""the pursuit of happiness"".

**7 - The Shining by Stephen King:** I've wanted to read a Stephen King book since forever, I thought what better way to dive into his world than with this classic. I loved the psychological horror in this book. The level of detail to which Jack Torrance's mind and thoughts are described slowly descending into madness was an insanely thrilling experience. I've seen countless people recommend pet sematary, almost certain it's going to be my next SK book.

**8 - The Silence of the Lambs by Thomas Harris:** When I¬†watched the movie last year (I confess), I instantly could tell that the book would be miles ahead of the movie, and I wanted to explore Hannibal Lecter a lot more deeply than was portrayed in the movie. I gotta say it did not disappoint. Fascinated by Hannibal Lecter, such a unique and thought-provoking character,¬†will definitely read The Red Dragon soon.

**9 - Dark Matter by Blake Crouch:** By far one of the most exciting plots I've read. I couldn't put it down once. The pace was perfect. Incredible plot twists. Absolutely incredible roller coaster of a book

**10, 11 - Six of Crows, Crooked Kingdom by Leigh Bardugo:** Decided to revisit the¬†YA genre (was obsessed back in high school with the genre, I know, typical)¬†with the Six of Crows since it was recommended to me a lot. No regrets. The plot almost always had me on the edge, I'm glad the author didn't feel pressured to drag it out for a trilogy which made it almost perfect. The characters were very unique, I absolutely loved being attached and connected to the characters throughout the books. Great character development as well. The only thing I didn't like about the books was the characters' ages (all teens who are under 20) I know it's this weird YA thing where it has to appeal to high school students but their age didn't make sense whatsoever.

**12 - The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath:** Obviously what got me to read this book was the circumstances surrounding the author. The plot being loosely based on her life made this book's reading experience surreal and really widened my perspective on mental health. It made me want to study a lot more about mental health and mental disorders.

**13 - Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoevsky:** I just finished this book. What a masterpiece. I finally get why its such a classic of russian literature (and all of literature for that matter) and why Dostoevsky is seen as a genius. This book was by far the realest piece of literature I've ever experienced. Dostoevsky¬†captures human nature in a truly profound way. I almost feel unworthy of even attempting to comment on it.


Hope this had something¬†meaningful, was just excited about being addicted to reading again and wanted to share my thoughts about what I read. Would truly appreciate if you shared your thoughts¬†with¬†me!

Have a great day everyone!",books,4688
"I'm not judging from a ""problematic"" angle. I can account for changing times/attitudes when consuming old media. Although, let's be clear, Fleming overshoots the level of male chauvinism attributable to the era landing in naked, deep-rooted misogyny.

Strictly as a spy thriller, *Casino Royale* fails to portray any engaging spycraft.

Rather than do a ""review"", I'll ask two fundamental questions:

1. Can anyone name a single instance James Bond succeeds in his task through his own initiative rather than luck (usually, the bad guys killing themselves off)?
2. Can anyone name a single thing James Bond says or does to woo/charm Vesper Lynd besides be the main character in a series filled with flat female characters?

The films arguably over-correct by making James Bond a superhuman sex-machine, but how else could you sell a character whose main attributes seem to be a dry joyless hedonism, luck, and elitist British navel-gazing?  They at least take advantage of the medium by casting handsome, charismatic leads to spearhead expensive, globetrotting stunt-bonanzas.

The only, and I mean only, bit of excellent writing I can even recall is Mathis taking the piss out of Bond's self-pitying bullshit throughout chapter 20 which contained a lot of wit and even meaningful psychological insight.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Mathis smiled back at him.  
&gt;  
&gt;'Continue, my dear friend. It is interesting for me to see this new Bond. Englishmen are so odd. They are like a nest of Chinese boxes. It takes a very long time to get to the centre of them. ***When one gets there the result is unrewarding, but the process is instructive and entertaining.*** Continue. Develop your arguments. ***There may be something I can use to my own chief the next time I want to get out of an unpleasant job.***' He grinned maliciously.

Damn, Mathis. The boy's already half-dead in a hospital bed. Chill.

Bond's introspective observations on the nature of evil, on the other hand, come off as teenage angst tinged by a dime-store take on Nietzsche because nothing in the narrative prior has built to his epiphany. He's unlikable, incompetent (yet highly critical of others' incompetence) and a bore. This is even without taking into consideration all of the casual, rape-fantasizing bigotry.

*Red Harvest* was written 30 years prior in the goddamn 1920s, with slang outdated to the point of parody, yet it still has a more modern narrative sensibility, gives us a better developed flawed protagonist surrounded by dynamic side characters, has much more engaging action/plotting, and is written with a more literate/poetic grasp of the English language to boot. A comparison to Chandler wouldn't even be fair at this point (I don't care if Chandler's praise is on the *Casino Royale* jacket: he's a better novelist than critic).

People actually recommend this to readers beyond 1960 insisting this is one of Fleming's best? Why? What's the appeal  besides historical significance and good will cultivated by the films?",books,3009
"I just completed ""A Suitable Boy"" by Vikram Seth. In 1349 pages it covers the life of different families in the post independent and partioned-India set in the 1951/52. The context of the book is more or less of a mother trying to find a son-in-law for her youngest daughter (and thus the name).

It revolves around multiple families, all in different places (financially and socially) in that time of India. The book also fantastically reels in the issues of religion, casteism, gender bias, arranged marriage, love, riots, India-Pakistan, politics and what not. 

Overall a brilliant (long) book which is hard to put down.

"i really loved the first half of ‚ÄöSapiens‚Äò by Yuval Noah Harrari. 

I loved that it described the general ‚Äöfeel‚Äò of the world around the time the humans started becoming the massive ‚Äöpower‚Äò in the world. And I loved how the book explored reasons for which we might be at that power that we are right now. 

But I feel since the middle of the book it has become mainly about economics and how they shaped the world that we are in right now. Even the science segment became more or less about economics.

Mind you, I am currently at chapter 19 and am not finished with the whole book.
I feel like the book became kinda boring since the second half.

"Who are you talking to about books?

I don't want my reading to be completely solitary pursuit, but I don't have that many people I could have quality discussions about books with.

Furthermore there's a problem of timing...

\- if you discuss a book *while reading* it, you risk spilling or encountering spoilers. But then, in some sense, it has most sense to discuss a book, especially if it's a long one, while experiencing it, with the people who are also reading, and therefore in the same boat.

\- if you discuss a book after reading it... you might not be as passionate.

Also there's a difference about how you feel about book right after reading it, versus a long time afterwards.

Also I would like to ask, how do you discuss books, where (in real life vs. online), with whom, and what do you enjoy most about it?

Have you ever had a truly stimulating, deep and meaningful discussion about books (maybe with some booze involved), beyond just counting reasons why you like it or not...

"I just finished reading Big Sky by Kate Atkinson, the most recent in her Jackson Brodie series. I am always amazed at the many plot and character threads in the novels and how neatly they get woven together by the end. That said, there was one thread that I felt never got tied up: the dog that Jackson saves from an abusive owner and becomes his companion in Started Early, Took My Dog. I waited the whole book for the dog‚Äôs previous owner to turn up again and somehow become part of the main plot but it never happened (unless I missed something.) Then when I started Big Sky I thought for sure we‚Äôd get more about the dog but again it never happened. In fact, Jackson has a different dog now and the previous dog is barely even referred to.

"[*The Folding Knife*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6616466-the-folding-knife) is the second K.J. Parker novel I've read after *Sixteen Ways to Defend a Walled City*. *The Folding Knife* was published in 2010, and like *Sixteen Ways*, it's a historical fantasy set in a secondary world devoid of magic.

This novel is written in the third-person and almost entirely from the point of view of Basso, a cunning banker who quickly claws his way to the top of the government. As First Citizen, he reshapes the financial and political institutions of the Vesani Republic to suit his needs. *The Folding Knife* is a study in hubris, and the opening chapter depicts a disgraced Basso in the present; it is the road to this inevitable fall that takes up the rest of the story. Personal and political conflicts are closely intertwined, suffused with tragic moments that tug at the heartstrings.

The setting appears heavily based on the Byzantine Empire, and the names of characters and places successfully tread the fine line between historically plausible and clearly fictional. The customs and beliefs of the Vesani, along with the various tribal factions, feel authentic and natural. 

While I loved *Sixteen Ways*, I struggled to get through *The Folding Knife*. It's longer, yes, but I also found large swathes of it bloated and plodding. The prose is bare and uninspiring. Very little is left to the reader's imagination, and every nuance and detail is indiscriminately spelled out on the pages, usually in the form of melodramatic dialogue. Attempts at witty comebacks fail to stick more often than they land. Aside from the highest parentheses-per-paragraph count I've seen, there are some rather abrupt POV shifts within scenes, which make for a jarring reading experience.

I enjoyed the technical (but dumbed down for readers like me) talk of economics, warfare, and numismatics in *Sixteen Ways*, and this book delivers even more of it. The bits about epidemiology were a nice touch in particular, though they strained my suspension of disbelief considering the time period. That said, I really like this aspect of Parker's style, and I hope to continue seeing it in his other books. 

As far as characters go, Basso is sufficiently fleshed out to have captured my interest. He's much less likeable than Orhan, but is nonetheless an interesting character to follow. I can't say the same for the other characters, who are mostly bland cut-outs or bureaucratic drones with a Latin name attached to them. 

*The Folding Knife* is not a bad book, but it did not match the hype at all, and it's not exactly a short read. There are flashes of brilliance, but I found it much less polished than *Sixteen Ways to Defend a Walled City*. I'd strongly recommend those interested in K.J. Parker to try the latter instead.",books,2819

"I started reading books 4 years ago, I was 16 back then. The book that made me a reader was The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown. I enjoyed it a lot, thus I read all of his books and read other thriller novels. I stayed in the genre for a while and decided to explore  another one.

I was in a bookstore trying to pick another book. I stumbled upon J.R.R. Tolkien's 'The Hobbit'. I thought back then fantasy will be the next genre I will dive in to. I managed to finish it and continued to the whole 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy. What can I say, I did NOT enjoy it. How did I manage to finish all of them despite not enjoying them? It's the hope that I will truly love it since lots of people enjoy it. ""It was just 4 books, I can manage"", I told myself. I read the last word of the 'Return of the King', I did not have the love that I thought I was going to give the books.

So why did I hate it? It is simple, it is all about the world building, the culture, legends and the myths. The books referenced them all through out the series. It was very hard to appreciate since you need to do a lot of reading to the indexes of the books. Since I was just beginning the habit of reading books, I did not have the energy to do that. It was literally about a whole another world with its' own history. That felt a drag for me.

After finishing them, I told myself I'm not gonna pick another High Fantasy books in a long time.  Although I read some with some fantasy elements in them like Percy Jackson but they did not have a huge world building like LOTR.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward 2 years. I visited a bookstore and saw 'A Game of Thrones' by George R.R. Martin in a shelf. I picked it but put it down back because I remembered all my experience with LOTR. Few weeks after that, I was going home from school, and while I was in the jeepney (this is a public vehicle commonly used in the Philippines for commuting) there was something in my head that told me 'You got to buy that A Game of Thrones Book'. And the next thing I knew I was checking it out in the cashier. I went home and... stacked it together with all my 'To Be Read' books (I know I'm not the only one who had this experience). But it did not take long before I read it, after I finished my current read I picked up AGOT. And boy, I loved it! I love how the book was written. It followed different characters and you know that even how separated these characters are, everything is intertwined.

Unfortunately, I could not really give it a fast read because I'm in college and I only have little time for leisure. But  tried my best to read it. I enjoyed it a lot and bought the rest of the series one by one. There is a lot of world building going on the series but I ignored it. Remember that was the thing I hated about LOTR. I was so in love with the plot lines, characters and mystery. The time came when I reached ASOS (3rd book) and by the time I finished it, I could really say, I was never been happier in my life. The 4th and 5th books were a bit of a drag because they were all buildup. Aftermath of the the first 3 books. But I still loved them.

I finished book 5. Hungry for more. But unfortunately, I think it will take a little more time. So to kind of satisfy my hunger, I joined different social media groups pertaining  to ASOIAF. I went there thinking I can catch up with them. But boy I was wrong. Every single threads are full of things that were not explicitly told in the books. The posts and comments are full of things about the legends and the myths of the series. Therefore, to catch up with them, I finally read through the history of Westeros. AND I WAS SO ASTONISHED! As I read more of the series's backstory I keep loving it more. Maybe my love for it is bigger than the gap of the publication date of the 5th and 6th book. I had more appreciation to ""minor"" characters while I learned their background. Even now, in my spare time, I still visit forums and read more about the lore.

Nowadays, ASOIAF series really gave me a fantasy hangover, thus i picked a finished fantasy series, and I'm currently in the second book of  Robert Jordan's  'A Wheel of Time'. I'm also loving it! but now as I progressed through the story, i check the glossary to learn about strange things being mentioned in the book.

I guess I really missed the point of the High Fantasy genre.

That is all!

P.S.

To all people waiting for ASOIAF #6, let's be strong and keep on waiting!  
To all people, have a nice life and let's survive this world !

TL;DR: I hated the world building aspect of fantasy but learned to love it after giving it another try.",books,4619

"Hi,

"I have to say this book are probably my favorite non-fiction books of all time, they explain a lot of topics from history to literature on a simple way, ordering the topics by chronological order, here is a list of cons and pros explaining why I love them

Pros

-They are beautiful, it's simple style drawings are very helpful and properly match the explanations
-The books are not to western - centered and focus on ideas and events from other countries
 Cons

- They are not very good books to get a deep understanding on specific subjects, they are rather focused on the general picture
-They are quite expensive

"# What I Did During My Summer Vacation

Part Two: I read something that is like acid poured on my soul. It seems to be going very well.

 Anais lies to her psychiatrist -- who lies on the couch as she diagnoses him from the Big Boy's chair -- telling him that she has abandoned the dirty caf√© life, along with those ravens of iniquity, Henry and June. She's a good little muffin now! She steps out of the dimly lit waiting room into the sun-drenched afternoon for a liter of wine and oh hey, it's Raggedy Henry and Redunculous June! Then off for an evening in a tiara, and this is where I'm tearing little pieces off the page corners.

Half the book gone, she's set up this society she chased after Henry into as a personal ideal: a hotbed of brutal practicality and emotion, the Real Deal, a morass of low-lifes, as a milleau to which she is dedicated. Never sure why, given that she always borrows words to describe it and it damn well never, ever actually interacts with her. If you want to know about 1930's French caf√© society, she's like the Howard Cosell of cheerleaders. Happy to talk about it while it goes on at a decent distance.

My problem is she's worked out that she likes girls - thanks, June - and has decided to go on the stalk inside what is suddenly and obviously her true society. So yes, I feel taken in. Why should I be surprised she's cheated me when now she's involved in ludicrous plots to help her crush, a bad writer and bored wife, cheat on her suspicious husband with a foreign prince at the Hermitage Muskovite?

How am I cheated? I've been dragged along through a hundred scenes which purported to show me the diseased underside of the seamy underbelly and barely caught a glimpse. I was promised fire and steam and vomit (okay, she delivered on the vomit, that was disgusting) but now-- Now! Nin sits up and pays attention to the bit players! Suddenly we see the flare of nostrils and smell the stink of patchouli on guilty, freckled skin! The energy she claimed existed for her only in the rough woolens aisle of life shows up, and its sitting at a filigreed table in damp silk organza. I mean, ffs!

"I always get inspired by people posting on this subreddit about reading a book a week or something similar. When I was younger, I was a newshound and would just read magazines and newspapers. It's cool to learn that I enjoy ""classics"" later in life.

The thing is, I don't seem to get ""lost"" in the books.

For example, I'm reading Grapes of Wrath right now. I feel attached to the characters and care what's happening. I do enjoy reading. Tonight, I just read ten minutes and quit. I might go at it again, but partially for a ""feel productive"" desire.

There are SO many books I want to read and I have a ton of free time. It seems I'd much rather just browse mindlessly on reddit etc than read though.

Meanwhile, when I played online multiplayer computer games, I'd have ""just one more game"" syndrome and pretty soon the evening was gone.

"My husband strictly reads nonfiction for pleasure. He doesn't find any enjoyment out of reading fiction novels. I suspected it's because he has a difficult time visualizing what he's reading. He processes factual information easier than producing coherent mental imagery. This theory is supported by the fact that he is a very visual learner and he loves film and television for that reason (documentaries especially).

Visual processing aside, what are some other reasons avid nonfiction readers steer away from fiction? How did nonfiction readers eventually get into fiction?

"This was inspired because I am reading the original Slayers novels from which the famous anime series was adapted from. The anime made a few changes to the protagonist Lina Inverse in particular making her  a redhead. Despite being based on Audrey Hepburn, because the original novel's illustrator drew her in anime art style, Lina doesn't appear to resemble Audrey Hepburn at first glance............

Being a diehard Audrey Hepburn watcher for decades........... It was very easy for me to not project Slayers with animated scenes of a redhead sorceress in my head as I read the original light novels............... Instead I visualize the description as a live action movie starring Audrey Hepburn as a sword-wielding sorceress!!! I even imagine Lina Inverse speaking with a similar British accent Audrey had irl made famous by her movies!

So I am curious do you have problems reading books after watching movies for the completely opposite  reason? When I was reading Doctor Zhivago and Gone With the Wind,I had difficulty with some of the characters because their descriptions differed so much. Ashley was described as far more handsome in the book than Leslie Howard was (who at that point was aged and worn out from his acting career) and not to mention the book described him as having a mustache and long hair at various chapters. Doctor Zhivago was even much harder- Yuri was described as not handsome at all, even words implying ugly...... While Lara was still implied to be dead drop gorgeous as Julie Christie was! So basically I had to visualize an ugly man with a gorgeous blonde blue-eyed bombshell unlike in the movie where famously extremely handsome Omar Sharif played Yuri.

In fact unless its my most favorite stars such as Shannen Doherty, Liz Taylor, Sophia Loren, Grace Kelly, and so much more esp the Goddess of Cinema Audrey Hepburn!!!!!!............. I now read the book before watching the movie because its a distraction trying to visualize the descriptions only for the movie star version to immediately project in a split second as you are reading a scene.

Does  anyone have the same problem? I bring the whole subject up because of the irony it was far more easier reading the Slayers light novels than watching the TV show because of how the Lina's supposed to resemble Audrey Hepburn in the books.

"Christopher Hitchens recommended reading Remembrance of Things Past by Proust, but recommended waiting until one was in their 30s or 40s. I am glad I heeded this advice.

This collection of books is outstanding. Granted I am only on page 232 of the 2500 page edition (smaller font than the 4500 page edition) but I am absolutely enthralled. I can't put it into words at all. The writing style is so descriptive and Proust is able to put thoughts and feelings and experiences of mine into words where I had failed to do so.

If you're on the fence about reading this book please give it the chance it thoroughly deserves.",books,620

"hi everybody, i was just wondering why there are some people like to write in their books (genuinely curious!)? i remember once that my teacher liked to do it so that when she rereads it, she sees what her thought process was, but personally, i like to think that if i wanna reread a book, i wanna feel like i‚Äôm reading it for the first time? if i wanted to remember something, i‚Äôd just write it in some separate place. so why do you guys write in books?",books,454
"So, I enjoy reading classics, but it easily becomes a struggle for me. I'm not sure if it's because the language is a bit different, because they have much different themes than modern books I read, or anything else, but when I read classics, I don't understand them at all unless I really focus hard. Because of this, I often skip out on reading books I really want to read due to not having the time or energy to focus on it like I would need to. I was wondering if anyone else has had these issues before and knows how to lessen them.",books,537

"I'm reading this book for the first time because my grandfather gave it to me, and I'm struck by how clean, evocative, and beautiful Leopold's prose is about the simplest subjects. Here he writes about the Passenger pigeon and the effect its extinction had:
&gt;    The pigeon was a biological storm. He was the lightning that played between two opposing potentials of intolerable intensity: the fat of the land and the oxygen of the air. Yearly the feathered tempest roared up, down, and across the continent, sucking up the laden fruits of forest and prairie, burning them in a traveling blast of life. Like any other chain reaction, the pigeon could survive no diminution of his own furious intensity. When the pigeoners subtracted from his numbers, and the pioneers chopped gaps in the continuity of his fuel, his flame guttered out with hardly a sputter or even a wisp of smoke.

&gt;   Today the oaks still flaunt their burden at the sky, but the feathered lightning is no more. Worm and weevil must now perform slowly and silently the biological task that once drew thunder from the firmament.

This is only a personal favorite passage from a book in which Leopold's love of nature and wistful sadness at its disappearance are eloquently apparent in every chapter. I have little naturalist literature better than this.",books,1325
"I found the Schooled in Magic series by Christopher G Nuttall in January of this year and wasn't able to put it down. It has become tied for my favorite series (the other is the Sword of Truth series by Terry Goodkind). 

I'm very bad at describing books without spoilers so I will just link to the Goodreads page for the series. 

I will say it has to do with magic, other worlds, and innovative concepts that change the world. Don't let it fool you its not a Potterhead rip off but it is based on a Female protagonist who attends a Magical school during what we would consider to be the Bronze Age

"I am currently listening to the audiobook of Devolution by Max Brooks.

Like his previous book, World War Z, the audiobook is narrated by an ensemble cast.  The principal narrator is [Judy Greer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judy_Greer), who voices the character of Kate Holland.  One of Ms. Greer's most notable previous roles was voicing the character of Cheryl Tunt on the television show [Archer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archer_(2009_TV_series)).

In chapter 15 of the audiobook, Ms. Greer narrates:

&gt;Dan...shoved the whole thing in his mouth and moaned what I think was the word ""Sploosh"" (a reference to his favorite show, Archer).

Very self-referential, having Ms. Greer recite lines from her other roles and mention their quality.

Things I want to know:

* Are these words present in the written book, or were they added (by Ms. Greer or Mr. Brooks) for the audiobook only?
* If Brooks authored this line, did he write this character with Judy Greer in mind, or is this just coincidence?",books,1008

"I have a very bad habit of picking up books, reading a good portion of it, and not reading it for months whenever I stop that initial reading. I've tried rereading before and it's extremely tedious because it feels redundant but also necessary. I realized the other day I can just use sparknotes or any of the *hundreds* of chapter summaries available online to catch myself up.

I tried it the other day and it reminded me of plot I forgot, but also when I went back into the book it felt just like when I was reading it before. I've been consistently reading this book for the past few days now and I'm very happy about this finding because I have so many more books I can finally get through using this method!

Fictional characters, an escape from life to the world of Camp Half blood, where drenched in sweat demigods used to have each other's back. I have always been pretty delinquent guy in my school. I was the person that used to cause trouble for teachers and make people laugh. Getting punished everyday, bunking lectures and stuff was pretty common back then but exposure to a fanfiction book got me engaged with a totally different circle, I started hanging out more with the geeks of my class and found out they aren't that bad people after all. My life changed there and I started putting more work on my goals and less time causing trouble.

"I just finished *Lady L* by Romain Gary, and enjoyed it very much, especially the ending. Delicious writing style, a really interesting storyline and storytelling, and a really satisfying ending.

However, it was a bit hard for me to have a clear picture of the historical background/cultural setting. After finishing the book, I tried to read some reviews or discussions on it online, but couldn't find anything. (eg. the author mentions some texts written by the character Armand Denis and I looked up his name and couldn't find him, I was curious if he was a real person). I also couldn't find many reviews of his books online.

I read Lady L because his book *La Vie Devant Soi* (*The Life Before Us*) is one of my favourite books of all time.

So I'd like to discuss him and his books, as I haven't been able to figure out what the general opinion on his works is.

Have you read anything by this author and if so, what was your favourite? If so, have you read this particular book, and did you enjoy it? Was it not translated in English or what is the reason no one mentions it?

Also, I should read short stories instead so I can get a sense of accomishment from finishing must faster. Enter 'Her Body &amp; Other Parties' by Carmen Maria Machado.

"So far I am a little over halfway through the book and I simply can not read any more of it. I‚Äôll have to take a long break probably. It is the most depraved and gross  book I have ever read, every character in the book is a shell of a human being and they have no original thoughts or behaviors, they are mindless drones and all they talk about is what clothes to wear or what brand of mineral water tastes the best. When I was reading this book it almost felt like I was reading a dystopian novel, but people like this actually exist in large numbers. The violence is very detailed and I‚Äôm amazed someone could actually think up some of the stuff in those scenes. I‚Äôm a big fan of Stephen king so I thought I could definitely stomach this book, but it is on a different level of fucked up. Despite everything I said, like how this is the most depraved and gross book I have ever read, oddly enough it is also the best book I have ever read. It does it‚Äôs job extremely well and it reads great, for example I think it is crazy how the book progresses from Patrick Bateman viciously murdering and raping a woman to him going on for ever about the intricacies of Whitney Houston‚Äôs music. That shift just fucks me up for some reason. I just need a break for my mental health before I reach the rat scene that everyone talks about. What are your thoughts on this book?

"One of my absolute favourite novels is ""Wuthering Heights"" by Emily Bront√´. I know that it is a very divisive book, a book that people either seem to love or detest. Personally, even if it is a very tough read at times emotionally, I absolute love the dark, haunting atmosphere of this novel about broken and horrible people bringing cruelty and despair upon one another over generations in a destructive cycle of abuse. Very few books manage to capture the sense of isolation, desolation and helplessness so well. 

And then I was earlier today listening to an audiobook of the Sherlock Holmes story ""The Adventure of the Copper Beeches"", where Holmes makes this observation to Watson about the English countryside: 

""You look at these scattered houses, and you are impressed by their beauty. I look at them, and the only thought which comes to me is a feeling of their isolation and of the impunity with which crime may be committed there. --- They always fill me with a certain horror. It is my belief, Watson, founded upon my experience, that the lowest and vilest alleys in London do not present a more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling and beautiful country-side. --- But the reason is very obvious. The pressure of public opinion can do in the town what the law cannot accomplish. There is no lane so vile that the scream of a tortured child, or the thud of a drunkard‚Äôs blow, does not beget sympathy and indignation among the neighbors, and then the whole machinery of justice is ever so close that a word of complaint can set it going, and there is but a step between the crime and the dock. But look at these lonely houses, each in its own fields, filled for the most part with poor ignorant folk who know little of the law. Think of the deeds of hellish cruelty, the hidden wickedness which may go on, year in, year out, in such places, and none the wiser.""

Yup, to me that quote quite well describes a big part of what makes ""Wuthering Heights"" so horrifically haunting and such great and timeless story!",books,2029

"I have never been a reader, I want to say that in my 24 years of life I have only ever finished less than 10 books from beginning to end(including school mandated ones).It was always hard for me to want to read or even focus enough to want to keep reading until I came across Mr. Bradbury. I had been assigned Fahrenheit 451  in 8th grade and I loved it! The dystopian worlds he creates are amazing and make my mind wander to immeasurable lengths. Recently would have been his 100th birthday and I was again inspired to read his books. I picked up the Martian Chronicles and The Illustrated Man in his honor and almost done with both!

 I think what I most like about his books/stories is the ease with which he illustrates the darkness/evil and or destructive human nature we all carry inside of us without ever explicitly saying it in words. ""And the Moon be Still as Bright"" was probably one of my favorites in Martian Chronicles because of this exact idea.

"Everybody seems hyped to watch the movie Dune, and for years I've seen Dune being recommended as a great, must-read sci-fi book. However, when I read it, it did not do anything to me. It was a chore to finish the book and took some willpower. To me it felt like another generic ""chosen one"" story. Sure, the world building and lore behind the setting are great and very well crafted, but story-wise it was ok. Maybe I am just burned out on ""chosen one"" stories.

Same thing happened when I read Isaac Asimov's Foundation trilogy, the world building is great, but the stories were meh to me. It's been a couple of years since I read Dune, so maybe I need to re-read more carefully, and maybe read the sequels.

Am I missing anything?",books,732
"It was The Road by Cormac McCarthy. I read it in high school, but it was required reading so naturally I didn't like it.

I picked it back up a few days ago and I was hooked from the start. The relationship between the man and the boy was so touching. I loved how, even when the boy made a mistake, the man never got angry and never blamed the boy. He always took responsibility for what went wrong.

I also really like how considerate the boy was of everyone. He wanted to help everyone he could, and he didn't even want to hurt the bad people.

"Hi guys! Sorry if this isn't the right place to post something like this. 

This past year I've really gotten into reading, but in the past three months or so I've been feeling like if I don't spend every spare second I have reading, I haven't had a productive day. If I'm not at work, I'm at home, and after waking up and cleaning, I have the entire day to do nothing if I want. But the problem is, if I am on my computer or watching TV, I feel like it's time I am wasting doing something I don't enjoy as much as reading, if that makes sense. Because I LOVE reading, it's just lately it feels like I've been viewing it as more of a quantity over quality thing. I'll try and smash out two or three books a day, but only one of those will be a book I've actually wanted to read for a long time and the others will be what I call ""easy"" books; middle grade or graphic novels, or a reread of something like Harry Potter. My goodreads challenge was to read 100 books this year, and I passed that in May, so I don't know why my brain is still like ""you have to read MORE! 100 books isn't enough!"".

I don't look at it as I need to read more books than anyone else, not at all. It's all for me because I enjoy it. But sometimes I'll just be doing something and I'll remember I haven't read anything yet today and I won't be able to get it off of my mind until I go and read 50-100 pages, just to feel like I made some progress.

"No, I‚Äôm not talking about speed reading. I‚Äôm talking about your average reading speed, as in the number of words you can read per minute while maintaining high retention.

"Hello! I hope this is an okay thing to post here. People who like books would be the people who care most about this! 

I started a petition to get Goodreads to add a ""short story collection"" category to the annual Goodreads Choice Awards. If you don't know about Goodreads (which everyone probably does), it's a website for reviewing books, and it serves as a kind of book-based social media platform (link: [here](https://www.goodreads.com/)). The annual Goodreads Choice Awards is where people vote on their favorite book released this year in one of many categories.

Currently, there are 20 categories in the Goodreads Choice Awards, including Poetry, Food &amp; Cookbooks, Science Fiction, Fantasy, YA Fantasy, etc etc.

I am a huge fan of short stories and really want to see short story collections have their own category both so that the form gets more attention and so talented authors who write them get a bigger platform for their work! The issue of short story collections and how they're treated by the publishing/reading world is in interesting one if you want to discuss it in the comments. I'm always looking for more opinions on how to get short stories in front of more eyes, and always trying to pay attention to the ways in which short stories are sidelined.

If you are a writer or reader of short stories, or someone who just agrees they deserve their own category because they are their own genre, I'd love for you to sign the petition and, if possible, share on social media. If you have any suggestions for other subreddits I can post this on, I'd really appreciate it. I think if this gets a lot of attention, Goodreads might actually do it. It's an easy enough thing to simply add another category!

**Here's** [**the petition**](http://chng.it/Pqqy76LZ)

So I finally picked up The Cruel Prince after everyone recommended it. I haven‚Äôt read a YA in forever and was super excited for it as it had all the YA cliches I‚Äôm a sucker for: enemies to lovers, bully male lead, fantasy, normal heroine grows strong.

But . . . I just got bored of the writing. I didn‚Äôt feel like the world was detailed out enough for me to really feel the faerie realm. Scenes felt like a sequence of she said, he said, she did this, he did that. Nothing felt like it had emotion. 

I was wondering what your guy‚Äôs thoughts were on it? And if this is a bad reoccurrence in YA?",books,609
"What are your thoughts on comparing this two masterpieces.

I have just finished brave new world.
What a great book!.Many said it was not good as 1984 so i had lower expectations but after reading the book i dont know how to rank  both.
1984 created a dark brutal and painful dystopian world but BNW created the opposite.

What i really liked about BNW is that it had such philosophical notions about the happiness,religion,escapism,morality,heirarchy.
It is world without war,without complaints.
We cannot completely negelect the statements by mustafa mond but it gives the space to ponder.

The loneliness of Savage and Bernard in two diff conditions is beautifully constructed.

"I just want to share a personal story.

I always wanted to be a serious reader, but in reality, I wasn't one. Too little time and too many distractions. Too short attention span during hectic days. And finally, too tired after work to do anything intellectually demanding after 5AM. And I do consider reading intellectually demanding. I don't like to read before bed because I am sleepy at that time, and I have problems following the plot and understanding the text when I am too tired.

Thank God I got and idea how to solve the problem: wake up at 4.15 AM and read before work.

That's what I do: I wake up at 4.15 AM, drink coffee, move around a bit, and I usually start reading at 4.45 AM, sometimes a little earlier. I read until 7.10 AM. At 7.10 I have to start preparing for work, as at 8.00 AM I have to be at work.

So, every morning I get around 2 hours and 25 minutes of uninterrupted, focused, quality reading.

As I deem reading very important for my self improvement, and as I want to put my personal quality goals before work, this is what I do. I dedicate my best hours, when my brain is most fresh and most rested to something I want to do for myself.

The sacrifice I have to make is that I need to go to sleep between 8.15 PM and 10.15 PM (at latest).

7-8 hours of sleep work fine for me. 6 hours is a little too little, but I can do with it too with enough coffee.

This is usually not such a big deal, because what I did after those hours most of the time (mindlessly surfing the internet) wasn't a quality time anyway.

During the weekends I do the same. Only I can read much more, as I can keep reading till 9AM or something like that, and then have a full free day for myself, to go outdoors, socialize, etc...

I knew that this would work for a very long time, but I wasn't daring enough to put it in practice, mostly due to fear of what people will think of me etc... Sometimes evening activities spoiled the plan, in some of my previous attempts in the past. But now during this pandemic period, this works surprisingly easy.

I fully recognize that this might not work for everyone as people have families and social obligations, but I still just want to share my story.",books,2200
"I read book one and initially gave it 4 stars. Then I continued the series, and was SO disappointed. Honestly the whole series could have been condensed into a single 500-600 page book.

I ended up skimming the last half of the third book. 

I ended up changing my rating to 2.5 stars for all of the books.  I typically don‚Äôt mind YA , but this just felt SO young for some reason. 

Curious to hear other‚Äôs experiences.",books,572

"Hi all,

Few month ago I decided to read Asimov's cycle.
I started with the robot, followed by the empire to end with foundation.
Today I finished it, I don't have anyone to share this with so here I am.

Tldr in the end

From best to worst ( there isn't one tome that is bad, I just enjoyed some better imo) :

Robots 
Foundation 
Empire

Here is a little feedback from my point of view, first of all even though Asimov himself said the last tome of foundation can be read alone I wouldn't recommend it, I would advise to read the Robots cycle and the fourth previous tome of foundation.
The empire cycle can be left appart as it doesn't brought anything important to fully understand the ending of foundation. However it's only 3 books that can be read fast, so if you enjoy his work go for it.

Robot cycle is the one I enjoyed most, you are first introduced to the cycle with novels mostly connected (I only recall one with jupiter being not related to the rest of the cycle) it build up the world we will later see evolve and the psychology of the robot are imo very interesting, I found myself thinking about how things could evolve through each reading time. Then there is few roman directly connected to each other, the characters are well written and I got attached to them (special shout out to my man... Robot Giskard) the story is slowly build to something which will be the foundation of the late tome of foundation.

Empire is good to read with great story, I enjoyed it less because I failed to see the connection between the Robot cycle to the empire, which I found while reading Foundation, before the final tome of foundation I wondered what was the point of the empire cycle in the global cycle. Nonetheless it's well written and isn't a loss of time.

Foundation, I first decided to go through all the cycle to read foundation and I dislike to pick up a book when it's connected to other without knowing what happened before. The first 3 tome are amazing the travel it brought us through space is awesome. The depicted humanity is on point. The science fiction is based mostly on science ( off course there is a lot of fiction in the science part) and can be appreciated as much by a scientist mind or a literary one. The 2 last which he wrote later in life are also great book I would recommend. You apparently can read both without reading any other book from the cycle, I fail to see how you could appreciate those two without knowing the galaxy he created before, so as said above I would recommend to go through at least all foundation book.

What is likeable about Asimov's works is the cinematography, with little details you can picture most of the scene, dialog, planet, spaceship.
It can be a good introduction to reading for those who don't particularly enjoy it, it's in the same time we'll written without being complex (maybe a few scientific words here and there but overall easy to read). It's sci fy so off course it's what you will mostly get however there is a bit of polar vibes throughout all the cycle and specialy in the robots.
It's humorous but never too much.

I am glad I went through all the cycle from start to finish, it was an amazing travel through space and time.  I will now put Sci fi on the side for a while and keep going with philosophy, French literature for a while then back to fantasy/Sci fi to relax.

Tldr : Asimov's cycle is great I would recommend it to anyone who wants to read a bit of Sci fi without it being too hard. I just wanted to share my appreciation for his work.

Thanks to those who read all my text.

For those who went through the complete cycle or even some of it, how did you enjoy it? 
I am particularly curious about those who only rode foundation, how did you apprehend the ending? 

Ps: sorry for some repetitive sentence, I just finished reading in my native language and switched back to English to wrote that.(yes still easier to read in your mother tongue even though there is a loss in translation)",books,3990
"I don't know how else to phrase it other then I'm new to reading. I can read and have been for aleast 25 years now haha but never did it for pleasure. Getting close to 30. Married and going through life. Perspectives change. Wants change. Dreams change. Just trying to better myself and experience new things. 

 Gave reading a go and love it. I've been missing out. Had no idea what I would like as far as genres or styles. Gave a few different ones a go and can say I enjoy everything I've read so far. I started with movie genres I like and went from there. Stephen King's salems lot. Frank E Perreti's The Oath. Sisters Brothers by Patrick deWitt. Biography on Johnny Cash. Forget the exact one off the top of my head. Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell. The first three books in the john carter series by Edgar Rice Burroughs. Just a few of what I've been getting into this past year. 

Id like to push myself to read atleast a book every two weeks for 2021. Saw a few videos of people who did one every week and thought that would turn it into a chore more then an enjoyable experience for myself where Im at right now. Figured one book a month would be pretty standard. Settled on every two weeks. Some books and series I'd like to tackle leave me a bit worried still on the two weeks. 

I've been creating a list on amazon as the next year gets closer. Like I said, Im new to this. I have no favorite author or type of book I love...yet. Any suggestions would be appreciated. What I have added so far is Wheel of Time, Dark tower series, Nathan Fa'avae: adventurer at heart, Economics in one lesson, Catcher in the Rye, Time Machine, Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy, World War Z, Blink, Dune, and tale of two citys.

"I read Catcher In The Rye at one of the peak moments of my teenage depression. I was 14 and on a really awful holiday with someone I thought was my friend at the time, but of course she wasn't a true friend as herself and her family verbally abused and neglected me the entire time. I wanted to go home, I was also dealing with neglect there too, but at least it was home. Alas, they wouldn't let me. Looking back, it (the holiday) wasn't  the worst thing that has happened to me, but it certainly felt like it at the time. It was  the longest 16 days of my life. I will spare the details...

 I guess I really related to how lost and depressed the protagonist felt. I remember thinking if Holden can make it back to NYC without committing suicide, then maybe I could make it back as well.

Right from the start, I was reminded of just why I love this guy's work so much. There's such a unique quality to his brand of storytelling. He has this unbelievable quality of presenting seemingly one dimensional characters, and then making us root for them. Nobody, and nothing is ever as it seems. 

This book is absolutely hilarious, but at the same time so impactful. It speaks of the difficulty of growing up, the complications of adulthood. As always, Backman finds the perfect balance between humor and tragedy, and weaves a charming tale about people who are a lot more than they're letting on. 

It's a lot about how messy life is, and how we inevitably keep making mistakes. But above all it's about compassion, and moving ahead, and giving others a chance to move ahead. There's just something so comforting about the stories he tells, and honestly I really needed this with the way the past few months have gone.",books,1223

"For those that don't know, Parable of the Sowers (book 1) and Parable of the Tenants (book 2) are post-apocalyptic dystopian novels written by Octavia Butler in the 1990s. They are based In 2025 and 2033 respectively. 

Specifically in this post, I wanted to emphasize how eerily accurate these books are in predicting some of the large issues we are experiencing in the modern US political and environmental climate. 

In the novel, the world is set in 2025 as a dystopian future where governments around the world have become more privatized, corrupt and against the common good, due to a warming climate, wildfires rage throughout the Southwest and California displacing millions and finally, synthetic drugs kill millions of poor and displaced persons.

In Parable of the Tenants a new President is elected who preaches zealously about the loss of American Christian values and taking back America from other races and religions that are not white or Christian (by violent forces often). Here is a passage from the book that I made me mutter ""crazy"" out loud : 

""Jarret \[the President-elect\] condemns the burnings (of non-Christians) but does so In such mild language that his people are free to hear what they want to hear....\[Jarret speaking\] 'Join us! Our doors are open to every nationality, every race! Leave your sinful past behind and become one of us. Help us to make America great again.' \[pg24\] . 

Following this is the following quote about his opponent ""Vice President Edward Jay Smith calls him a demagogue, a rabble-rouser and a hypocrite. Smith is right, of course, but Smith is a tired gray shadow of a man..."" \[pg24\].

Like WTF. Does this not sound like our current President calling the White Nationalists in Virginia ""very nice people""  not directly condemning racist acts by police or the couple in Missouri who flaunted guns at BLM protesters. Or the FACT THAT MAGA is in the text or that Vice President Smith does not sound slightly like Vice President Joe Biden. 

I write this line from usually sunny California, where rampaging wildfires have literally blotted out the sun. And based on global warming predictions are only to get worse. I feel as if I am in the shoes of Olamina's father watching the world devolve into the world of Parables.

While Parable of the Sowers and Tenants is much more extreme, creepy, dystopian world that I am happy I am not a part of, the book eerily predicts some of the modern trends that American citizens are grappling with and makes me even more scared for what else this book will predict correctly as time continues.",books,2593

"My mind is blown; this book is an experience. There's just so much going on and for such a large book, I'm surprised I breezed through it so quickly. The Secret History has such despicable characters, I'm sorry, and everybody had it coming but I still manage to love these people, and I can't quite put my finger on why. If these 5 were caught in their murder, they'd be on r/truecrime where everybody is calling them psychopaths and chanting for their murder. 


One thing I'm convinced of is that they sacrificed that man during the bacchanal on purpose, because I do not buy it for a second that they had truly 'lost their minds' as Henry would like us to believe. Oh, Henry. I have so many conflicted feelings about him. For one, he's awful and he's cruel and psychopathic and I cannot get why he's so romanticised and yet...I just love this character. Donna Tartt has made me realise that Henry Winter is all these romanticised violent Phillip Lombardesque characters, but when karma gets them.


As for Richard, I truly despise this guy, because he's a spineless coward but his 'morbid longing for the pictueresuqe' was terrifyingly relatable to me. But what gets me is how up until his murder, Bunny was always the least likeable and most awful of these people and yet, in death, Bunny was a great person whose memory lived on in a spurious manner. I don't think his murder was justified, even if he's classist, homophobic and misogynistic, but how they all ended up in awful places while his memory was pristine makes you think. Charles is the prime example of this, whom I can't help but like even when I know I should despise this person.

"I read the Steve Jobs biography and it was a fantastic read. I was impressed with the limited time that Isaac had in order to create this work. He did great research and he didn‚Äôt include a lot of fluff, which helped keep you interested throughout the book. I picked up his Benjamin Franklin biography out of respect for his Steve Jobs biography. 

It‚Äôs hard to give a score objectively to this biography because it‚Äôs a deeply political book and you have to be very interested in politics to keep yourself interested. In many parts of the book it was pretty hard to keep reading. I also felt that there was much more fluff in this biography that didn‚Äôt feel important enough to show the reader to keep them interested. I suppose Isaacson learned from this book and improved his writing in his later books, as this was written in the early 2000‚Äôs. 

With that said there are positives. As expected, you get a pretty good glimpse in what kind of person Benjamin Franklin was and insight into his genius. He influenced American society much more than I thought and was basically the foundation to old American culture and independence. Extremely impressive on the amount of research Walter Isaacson put into this book; easily the hallmark of this book. With that said, more research does not necessarily mean a better book as it starts to narrow your audience that is willing to be interested in all of that knowledge. 

Objectively, I give this book a 5/5 as a biography, as if I was a history buff who wants to accessorize their already strong foundation in early American political history. 

As someone who isn‚Äôt well read or interested in politics, but was interested in getting a glimpse into who Benjamin Franklin was as a major figure in American history, I give it a 3/5.",books,1777

The writing Is great, it's just hidden in dense sentences, with weird wordplay and esoteric words.

Yet when you do finally understand what he means it's a wonderful feeling. The imagery in the book is incredible.

A man seeing a rocket take off from his balcony, with the knowledge that it may kill him, and his panicked moments trying to prevent his demise with the clock ticking ever closer.

Soldiers stepping out of a lit up bus stop into a pitch black bus, forever disappearing into the night never to be seen again, some gaining more seconds with the last flecks of their cigarettes.

Then you've got amazing prose, like his comparison of a family's demise using an almost mathematical representation, by showing their dwindling power through the interest, of the interest on accounts, and how it ever nears, but never reaches absolute zero.

Incredible....

I'm going to be at this book forever, but it really is incredible once you understand what it's going for.

&gt;Dzurec didn‚Äôt identify the owners but told the board they‚Äôre in their late 60s and that one has an illness that left them in a wheelchair.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúThis case, at its core, is about accessibility,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe property is owned by a trust, and our clients are the beneficiaries of the trust and will reside there hopefully for the remainder of their lives. They‚Äôre an aging couple that both have mobility issues. One of them is essentially down to a wheelchair now, and we don‚Äôt anticipate that changing any time in the future ‚Äî and this is about providing safe access to an upper-level deck structure.‚Äù

So does that mean GRRM is now in a wheelchair? Or did something happen to his wife Parris? I know they have enough money to burn, but they're both getting older and reading that one of them has become wheelchair bound made me a bit sad and worried for them.",books,1654
"I've just finished this amazing book recently and i really would love to see this story on a big screen. I especially liked the style, feeling and vibe of the Moscow and Russia as a whole during the Stalin era. It was just so great and interesting.

If it was made into a movie, i think it could have similar energy and aesthetic to the movie 'Great Budapest Hotel'. And i think Christoph Waltz would fit Alexander Rostov's role just perfectly!

"Just read both **Milk and Honey** by *Rupi Kaur* and **The Princess Saves Herself in This One** by *Amanda Lovelace* and I have to say, not that I'm disappointed because I didn't expect much to begin with, I'm just sad that this kind of poetry is so popular. 

I think that being direct in poetry can be quite pretty and moving, only if it's done well. I don't know if it's unpopular to say this, but I don't think that it's done well in these books. It's as if I'm reading sentences 12 year old me wrote on her tumblr blog thinking I was being deep. 

The way it's written also annoys me, I know some people find writing in lowercase letters aesthetically pleasing but it just seems lazy and unoriginal to me. 

I think some lines were pretty yes, but I don't think I've read a single one of their poems that stood out. They lack depth, meaning and anyone could have written them.

I'm interested in why people like them, I mean, I get teenagers and kids who enjoy this kind of poetry and share it on their social media, but if there are any adults out there who enjoy this I'd love to hear your perspective.",books,1109
"Hello,  
I'm looking for literary retellings of the story of Hua Mulan by contemporary authors. Preferably by Chinese female authors.  
I'd love to find an adult version that goes in depth about Mulan's mind and feelings while in army, surrounded by men and in disguise. Think of something similar to Ursula K. LeGuin's ""Lavinia"", Madeline Miller's ""Circe"" or Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni's ""Palace of Illusions"" but about Hua Mulan.

Any suggestions?

PS: I've read the Ballad of Mulan already, I'm trying to find other traditional versions of it by Chinese sources.

"I'm in my thirties, and throughout my life, I guess I've never sought out tragic movies, plays, books, etc.  Sure, I've heard sad songs and watched and read Shakespeare plays, but there was always a remove.

Last night, I read Norwegian Wood by Haruki Murakami and it broke me inside.  I've never shed tears about a book until that night, and even this morning.

(This is where the spoilers start, so if you're interested in reading it I highly recommend you do so and click back now while you can).

This book just had an overwhelming sense of dread, and unavoidable calamity, and relentless sadness.

Momo, Kizuki, Hatsumi, and Naoko all take their lives over the course of the story of this group of people.  All of them with no explanation, save for the hint that Hatsumi never got over her toxic college relationship, and that Naoko was almost cursed from birth having experienced the suicide of both her sister and her best friend/soul mate.

Toru experiences pain all around him.  Lonely, mocked Storm Trooper.  Midori's cancer-stricken father.  Reiko, giving up on the outside world and retreating into a hermetic existence.  And even himself, taking himself too seriously.  But how could he not?  He's surrounded by loss, almost constantly.

At the end of the story, he's calling his neglected, likely furious girlfriend and wondering where he even is.  How soon until she hangs up on him, exasperated and just done with it?  In the beginning of the story, he's feeling sick simply from listening to an old song twenty-years after the events of the book.  The events of his youth still have that much of an effect on him.

I just wanted to protect all the characters, to fix them, to change how the events happened.  But I couldn't.  Sometimes people just... die.  Sometimes it's just a matter of time.  Naoko was probably dead as soon as Kizuki killed himself.  And why did he kill himself?  Mental illness?  Depression?  He was young, had a great girlfriend, a best friend.  Doesn't make sense.  But sometimes, it just doesn't.

I'm torn between wanting to watch the movie, and read essays and opinions on this story... and never touching it again.  It's just too raw, too real for me.  If I can take one positive thing from this, it's that this book reminded me of how powerful art and writing can be.

Thank you for reading this.",books,2342

* How much did you know about the work the Resistance (and the women working for it) did in Europe before starting this book?

&gt;He claimed they would excel at clandestine tasks, as women were secretive, accustomed to isolation, possessed of a ""cool and lonely courage.""

* What do you think of this reasoning as to why women in particular are suited to spy work?
* What is your impression of the women involved so far?
* Do you think Rose is doing a good job of conveying how dangerous the work these women (and men) are doing in France?
* What do you think of Rose's writing style overall?
* What has been the most interesting thing you learned from the book so far?",books,973
"First off, let me say that it is a really good book and I enjoyed reading it and how it made me reconsider how we live as a society and why books are important.

That being said, all my life I was told this was a book about censorship. After reading through it for myself, I would say that censorship is actually a rather minor message in this book. Yeah, books are banned and burned, but it's not that the information in them is illegal. Society as a whole removed books, rather than the government, because they no longer wanted to have to THINK. All the stories could easily be made into 5 minute movies or shows to be quickly played on the TV and I'm guessing no one would have an issue with it. It's the fact that books make us think critically about the world we're living in is what created a problem for so many people. Critical thinking can be very painful and cause us to feel emotions we would rather avoid because it's easier. We see this when Montag recites part of ""Dover Beach"" and Millie's friend begins crying immediately. This is not about censorship. This is about people avoiding things because it's easier to do so.

It makes me wonder why so many people have told me that's what this book was about. Bradbury talks about critical thinking, interpersonal relationships, depression, and so many other themes, but censorship is only present in book burning.

After reading *Fahrenheit 451*, I would say that this book is about so much more than censorship. I think if one theme were to be given to this book as a whole, it would have to be the importance of critical thinking. And critical thinking doesn't always have to come from books (there's a quote about this in *Fahrenheit 451* somewhere, but I can't find it), but books are the greatest facilitators of it.

Overall, Bradbury did a great job with this book. Excellent use of characters and symbolism (I really like the duality of fire being destruction and knowledge). Sorry if this post seemed stream-of-consciousnessesque. I just wanted to quickly jot down my thoughts and see what other people were thinking.",books,2089

"As you know there is an Iranian character in the book. Parvaneh, the pregnant neighbor. I‚Äôve seen very few books and even movies where the Iranian character is not politicized or mixed with other races.It was so refreshing to see characters with the same race. Parvaneh, whose name literally mean butterfly, gave me so much hope that people don‚Äôt see Iranians by their government and politics. For those who may not know, Iranians generally are just that welcoming and friendly like you wouldn‚Äôt ever miss a gathering at your relatives every month. I praise Backman for his portrayal of Iranians. Unfortunately, I read the book translated into Persian/Farsi, of course, it was brutally censored; like the gay guy was not even mention he was gay. There was some signals otherwise I wouldn‚Äôt have known. Overall, Beckman‚Äôs masterpiece has made me a lifelong fan :)",books,862
"Of course, small spoilers. I loved it. 

I never read this one in HS, and I can see why a teacher may choose it for ""angsty"" teens, but I am glad I didn't. 

Having just finished the book and not yet looking to tear it up with analysis, my initial reaction is that I saw a lot of my high school self, and even more my freshmen to junior college self, in Holden. I hated everything, small things would get on my nerves so much, I would fail classes I shouldn't have failed, and I couldn't get past a bad teacher to apply myself. I always wanted to find some passion in life and never was satisfied with anything. I would daydream of being someone that mattered. And the way Holden handles his sexual desires hits hard. I can't imagine what that kid would have done if he had an internet browser. Oh wait *I* can...

When I read Mr. Antolini's monologue about falling forever, it really connected to me. I'd like to get it printed out and framed.

Not everything Holden believed was true for me, for example, I loved movies, and I could stand most small talk. But, alternatively, many of Holden's more specific problems were analogous to mine. Holden mentions his hate for New York a lot, and his desire to move West. I grew up in a Raleigh, NC. Not exactly NYC. Yet, my feelings about Raleigh soured as I did, especially my feelings towards suburbia as a concept. I often dreamed of moving west, of course, I never went so far down the rabbit hole as Holden.

After reading, I looked around online to see what other people had to say. Many didn't like it. I totally get that. Perhaps if I had an easier transition with maturity, none of this would relate to me at all. Likewise, Holden's specific identity might play into what he is feeling. If I were not a middle-class young white male, I am not sure all the same connections would be there. Of course, that's an assumption I can't confirm, and many people can find analogous experiences in characters with little shared identity. Additionally, I noticed that many critics (especially at the time) didn't like the language, which I guess is valid. But for me the language was perfect, and I loved it the same reason I love Huck Finn. As for Holden being annoying, hell yeah he was. I am sure I was too, but I would have died before I admitted it then. That's kinda why I wouldn't have liked it in HS.

I understand that for someone who has read and reread this book and has thought deeply about the themes, my initial reaction my be a bit surface level. Can't help that. But regardless, what did y'all think?",books,2559

"It got me interested in the count of monte cristo - I am 31 and when I was a kid I remember seeing the wishbone version of it...what's the storyy wishbone? do do do do do do dooo

Tbh though I do not like reading so I looked for the best film adaptation of the story and turns out its the count of monte cristo 1998 miniseries from france. 

What i've learned you can't do these big books justice in a 2 hour movie, but with a 6.5 hour series it does a great job and is quite true to the original minus a few minor changes!

Then i watched charles dickens great expectations serial and I liked it too, and then david copperfield series.

I like that they make these cos people who don't like to read can still enjoy a good story and don't cut out a bunch of stuff like the movies do. It seems the 80s and 90s were a great time for these kinds of shows.

Now i downloaded all the episodes of wishbone and I got the Cyrano de Bergerac movie which everyone said its good, but im not sure im interested cos the girl from wishbone seems very annoying like ""oh you can tell me great poetry? get lost!"" but i guess thats just how it is, people say that story is best to view in a story cos originally its meant to be a play and reading it doesnt do it justice, so i guess thats an instance where the film is better than the book xD

Things I am hoping for:

* Consistently solid writing throughout the series
* New worlds (not necessarily magic)
* A great sense of arc through the individual books and through the series
* About the same page count for books
* Ease of access (it can be for adults, but not too complicated)

"I'm trying to convince my mother to read or at least listen to audiobooks. I've got her to read warbreaker by Brandon Sanderson and she really liked it. I also read aloud every day in the kitchen when my wife or mom (mom lives with me and my family) are cooking. She's sat through the whole mistborn trilogy and even was the one who would ask me to read most of the time and got really into the story. All of this has convinced me that she'd probably enjoy reading or listening to audiobooks.

The thing is she's very religious and had a lot of books on religion and what not that she's amassed but never read. She insists that she loves those books but hates reading because whenever she tries reading one she gets bored or falls asleep. I'm trying to explain that if she enjoyed warbreaker and the mistborn trilogy she probably doesn't hate reading as much as she thinks but rather is trying to read stuff she doesn't like because she assumes she should like reading it. 

Not trying to bash religious books or anything just saying if you can listen to someone reading for an hour+ a day or spend an hour a day for a while reading but you fall asleep within 10-15 min. Or reading or listening to a certain book then perhaps it's less that you don't enjoy reading and more that you don't enjoy the book you're reading.",books,1319

"First and foremost, don‚Äôt judge a book by its cover. If you think you know Che, you don‚Äôt. If you have any interest in Che and how he came about to hate the U.S. and other imperialist countries, Castro and his brother, Cuba, the Bay of Pigs, the Cuba Missile Crisis, Che's involvement in the Congo (another great book covers this better:King Leopold's Ghost), South America, and the involvement of the U.S. in Latin American politics (the CIA setting up puppet governments to control the spreading of communism and the killing of thousands of individuals which as caused a wave of events that we still continue to see today with immigration) then I highly recommend this book. This is such a well-researched book with so much detail as it uses many of Che‚Äôs personal letters and journals and poems. This book covers Che‚Äôs entire life and it does not worship him nor makes him seem as an evil individual, but rather paints a perfect image of who he truly was: a very complicated individual.

"This is a researched account of the history of secret societies and/or of numerous less known/understood philosophies/beliefs that have been held by many famous people over the course of documented history. It was well cited and has a great appendix and index. 

I appreciated how the author made it clear that the theories are wildly controversial, sometimes offensive and often quite laughable. Yet at the same time he writes from a 'believer' point of view. His writing with confidence helps to keep the credibility up which makes it simpler to maintain an temporary belief in it, like reading an historical fiction. I also liked how it starts from the beginning of the universe up til modern day. 

Esoteric and philosophical books often bore me, this was different. This was somehow fun, possibly because it was so unrealistic and barely possible while being told from a total believer view, like a sci-fi.  

While long, it was an easy read and didn't feel like a text book (it reminded me of reading *A Peoples History of the US* ((Zinn)) although i admit APH was much easier and believable, this book is like a fantasy APH). It became hard at parts as it requires the reader to literally suspend belief in reality in order to describe history from its pov. I started to consider it an exercise in open-mindedness. 

Generally i am a reader of fiction and sci fi, my favorite authors are Kurt Vonnegut, PK Dick and Tom Robbins. I came at this in a similar mind set, just out to be entertained and somewhat induced to stretch my mind a bit. This book totally did all that, also it offered other ways of looking at specific instances in history from a different point of view. 

An unintended consequence of this book was a look into the Abrahamic religions more confusing (magical) beliefs and how they relate to each other, Buddhist/Hindu beliefs and the actual time period they existed in. 

This book doesn't offer a rational singular belief, it doesn't try to convince but it describes many of the worlds more famous people belief in a way i have never read before.",books,2075

\*\*What is Perry Rhodan you may ask?\*\*

 Perry Rhodan is from Germany and the longest running SciFI Series in the world. The first novel booklet was released in September 1961. Since then, they have released a novel booklet, which is about 50-70 pages of full text, every single week, not missing a single instance. This week they released Novel Booklet No. 3082. Obviously there are multiple people planning and writing the story together.

 \*\*Why are there books at the top of your picture?\*\*

 I have the first 1099 novel Booklets in book form. Each book contains multiple novel booklets, roughly 6-8 (it depends), to make it easier to read (and store). The ‚Äúsummary‚Äù books started after the original series, so they are behind the first edition. Therefore I decided to quite the books at Book No 129 ( Novel Booklet 1099, or end of the 11th Story Cycle) and switch to the original novel booklets. 

In the top left corner you can see Book 1, containing Booklets 1-8, and book 129 at the bottom of the shelf. The series then continues in the boxes.  
 Each of my boxes contains 70 novel booklets, with one at the front with a nice visible front. I did put double sided tape at the front and a transparent cover, so that I can put different  novel booklets and design in there, what ever I feel like.   
 The boxes therefore contain novel booklet 1100-3082, the newest, + a box with bonus booklets.

 \*\*What is the story about?\*\*

 Written in 1961, the story starts in 1969, back then 8 years in the future. The main character is an astronaut and the first man on the moon. But on the moon, he discovers a spaceship from another species. The series than goes on with what would happen it mankind would suddenly be catapulted into the technological future from one day to the next day. What would we do with such power? And then, mankinds long journey into space begins‚Ä¶

 Before you ask: Yes, it is one single story line (with lots of sub-plots obviously), but generally, behind every cycle (mostly 100 booklets) is a super-cylce which contains multiple cycles and is often about 400-600 booklets long. Its like your favourite book/series never ends.  
 Also: I didn‚Äôt finish reading everything, and it will still take me multiple years (depends how frequently I read) to finish all the booklets, considering they put out 53 new ones each year.",books,2479
"Basically as the title said,I'm looking for ways to improve my reading experience on my PC/phone and make it more enjoyable for myself. Are there apps dedicated to reading or some settings?

I was really into books when I was younger but at some point I couldn't continue because major printing/publishing companies dropped my favorite books. And getting them shipped to mu country is too expensive. Also the quality of books declined.

Plain white background and dense text makes it impossible for me to stick to reading. Additionally I don't like scrolling with big zoom, I prefer full page change with arrows.

I spend 16 hours a day in front of my PC as it is, reading documentation and writing code in dark mode so looking at black on white text is unbearable on my eyes.

Also it would help with reading my text books.

I really liked an app I used for reading Chinese light novels, with brownish paper, and paragraphs were more spaced out, and not so dense.",books,964

"Hey guys,

I finished reading The Death of Ivan Ilyich, and I found it to be an amazing read. I actually read it twice and picked up on character nuances that I missed the first time. It is hard to explain, but Tolstoy does characters really, really well. I think it is the subtly he writes into their thinking and motivations around their actions.

What do you guys think about the book and how Tolstoy draws the characters in his novella?",books,440
I listen to the audiobook of whatever book I'm currently reading in the shower and on my daily commute.  My biggest pet peeve is when the narrator whispers or yells according to whatever the character he's reading is doing.  I find myself having to jump back and adjusting the volume level over and over.  I'd MUCH rather have a monotone narrator that sounds like he's reading a washing machine repair manual than put up with that.  At least with a boring narrator you can understand what is being said.  I got about a chapter into A Brave New World before giving up on it.,books,573

"I did enjoy the book, but my main enjoyment came from her writing style and descriptions. The line 'People really can change one another' near the end of the book confused me a little, because I'm not really sure how they changed each other. They obviously altered the events that happened in each other's lives, but I don't know how they changed each other internally, and if I'm being perfectly honest I don't see that much growth in either character over the course of the novel. I felt they allowed different sides of each other to be expressed when together, but I dont think this is the same as changing. 
I might just be a bit dense and unperceptive though so if anyone could provide me with a character analysis / arc that would be appreciated. 

Also when reading people's opinions online, there seems to be a divide in opinion between people who think the book is a great character study, and people who think the characters are undeveloped and basic. What do you guys think and why? I guess my personal opinion is that she's done a really good job at drawing out characters that you can empathise with on a deep level - you really do feel their pain. But I am kind of torn on whether that means they are developed / complex characters, I'm not sure why but even though I felt like I 'got' both characters, it felt there was something lacking in their motivations? I'm not sure if that's exactly the right way to describe it, because I'm pretty sure like for any given event in the book I could provide an explanation for why the characters were acting / feeling how they were, but I dont know why but something feels lacking to me.

"And it was amazing! And i personally think everyone should give it a read. The story is about a group of farm animals who are going against their human farmer. In doing so, they are trying to create a society¬† where the animals can be equal, free, and happy. Things dont go as planned for the animals, and the farm ends up in a state as bad as it was before, or maybe even worse.¬†


The themes of this book are very political, in a very satirical way. Everything from manipulating the rules, to making deals with other humans, lying about deaths and making secret¬† alliances, it shows what can happen when people, (pigs) get too much power.¬†


The 7 commandments: Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy, whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend, no animal shall wear clothes, no animal shall sleep in bed, no animal shall drink alcohol, no animal shall kill any other animal and all animals are equal. The way the pig leaders on the farm constantly change the commandments using propaganda was very interesting. And there is one quote that i think is more important and relevant than all the others, when the leader pigs have taken control over the other animals and changed all of the 7 commandments:

I can't find an answer for this question. There are countless great novels that have not been adapted for the film/TV medium. As mentioned previously there could be a number of reasons for a great work having not been adapted.

There are also a lot of authors that have had one or two of their works made into movies or shows, but then have the majority of their novels stay solely as books.

I suppose this is a hard question to answer. A way of answering this question more easily would be to put together a list/s of the 'thousand best/great novels' and see if those works have been turned into screenplays and films. I don't have a clue how many 'great novels' there might be under a more subjective, looser definition.",books,949
"Hey all,

So, I have started reading ""And then there were none"" by Agatha Christie, I am currently in the 2nd chapter. I saw that there is also a miniseries on it so, thought to do it parallelly. But here comes a problem.

I see that the content in the miniseries and the novel differ for a bit for example:-

//Start of a bit of story:-

In the novel, Emily brent was there with the others in the boat during arrival but in the series, I didn't see her, also in the novel there is a conversation of Lombard with vera near the taxis at the train station in the series I never got to see the train station at all. I only watched till there and am posting this to clarify things out.

So, what I want to ask those of you who read the novel and watched the series do you think its a good idea for me to watch/ read parallelly, or is there any chance of clashes and spoilers for me.

Please Do not give any spoilers. Thank you.",books,923

"I have never read it and don't plan to but the story behind the author made me cry. A 16 year old who had a passion for writing created a fantasy fan fiction novel and submitted it to a fan magazine. He drew little pictures in the margins and it was clear he was proud with the world he created and this was something he probably also wasn't very serious about nor actually thought would actually get published.The magazine did publish it without his name on it hoping he wouldn't notice. 

Later his book became mocked by the whole world. Grown adults were making fun of this boy and making their own copies to sell as a joke. The boy did not receive a single cent for his work. He was bullied to the point where he vowed to never write again. He never did because he did in 2002. The thought that a beautiful passion was lost due to something like this is heartbreaking. Yes the book may have sucked but he was a teenager who did this for fun. Looking back at the stuff I wrote as a kid it probably was just as cringey. He could have been able to write better stories when he got older if he practiced but that drive was taken from him. His name and passion tarnished forever. 

I think about him from time to time and it makes my heart sad. Writing is such a beautiful and personal hobby, whether the writing is bad or not its always something I would want someone to feel encouraged to do. Grown adults made money off another person's ( child ) pain. Its one thing to not like someone's book or writing or to give a fair/critical review on it but to do so should be in the hopes that the author gets better, not to belittle them.",books,1633
"Hi Guys,

Did anyone have a hard time getting through DAN BROWNS' ORIGIN? I bought 4 of Dan browns books with so much passion, and I cant get into the very first one.

There is way too much description of the architecture and the progression of the story is insanely slow. I could care less about most of the characters, the books details so much about.

"I recently finished reading Rebecca by Daphne du Maurier, which I loved overall. The one thing that struck me the most though was the way the author describes the main character's anxiety. She (we never learn her actual name) is pretty consistently written with this aspect of her personality either just below the surface as an internal monologue, or sometimes blatantly on display. Specifically, a couple sections really spoke to me and my own struggles with anxiety. 

There's a bit where the main character is worried about her husband because he's been away for a while, and she spirals down this thought process of ""what if he got in car accident"". She's completely at the mercy of her imagination, and I can't count how many times I've been in that exact same mindset in my life. I'd consider my own anxiety relatively mild, but I've still walked myself to the edge of a panic attack when a loved one seems like they've been gone just a little too long. 

Another section involves the MC worrying that her husband &gt;!will be hanged, and she rambles on about how she's heard that hanged people don't always die right away.!&lt; It's written in a way where you can tell she's losing her grip, how she can't really get away from the thought. She then attempts to think about something, anything, else. She imagines her former employer and what her life might be like, but the attempt is futile and eventually leads right back to that crippling thought. This was another all too familiar experience for me. I've made that desperate attempt to get my mind on something else, only to have it fail miserably. 

This all led me to think about how special it is when you feel ""seen"" by a book, and how a book can maybe do this better than any other medium. Instead of this story sending me into a panic attack, it more often than not made me feel a little less isolated in my anxiety. 

Seeing yourself in a book is something often talked about as an important experience for young readers, but I didn't expect it to still happen to me as an adult that has been reading for most of their life.",books,2093
" Hello! I have been recently re-reading my all time favorite novel (or stories, more accurately), The King in Yellow by Robert W. Chambers. I have long been a fan of horror, mystery, and heavy emotional pieces. In high school especially I read stories such as Dracula, Lovecraft's famous works, Neil Gaiman's ghost and horror stories, and the like. I loved each of them - mostly for the feeling they created, and the messages they provided. Enveloping my brain in adventures which featured the disturbing, the unnatural, or the ambiguous was very rewarding for me, and I could hardly get enough of it.

When I finally got my hands on a copy of The King in Yellow - a story I had only heard of and knew nothing about - I was very anticipatory. I was excited to learn that Lovecraft was a humongous fan of Chambers, and that the short stories within The King in Yellow had been remarkable influences in American horror literature as a whole. Still, I was a bit fearful that grabbing this book blindly off the shelf would yield a mute disappointment. 
    
Wow. I was wrong. The King In Yellow is, in my experience of horror literature, the most beautiful and powerful piece of dread-inducing writing I have ever laid my hands on. If you love dark, ambiguous, cosmic horror, you are doing yourself a disservice by not reading this book. Chambers creates the most potent feelings of unease I have ever read in a story - the fear from the words on the page are almost dream-like in their captivation and intensity. Finishing each of the four stories which encompass The King in Yellow‚Äôs writing was a shock to my system, and needed a moment to reorient myself after finishing each one. 
    
Lovecraft, despite his deep influence and creation of the Cthulhu mythos, had a few weaknesses within his horror works. I found that his tales were at their best when they encompassed a sort of true, subliminal, dread or madness - The Picture in the House, The Rats in the Walls, Nyarlathotep and The Color Out of Space reign, in my opinion, his best works - not because what they present is scary, but rather, what is dangerously out of place - the fearful existence of something which truly should not be. The madness, disturbing mental processes, or (in Color‚Äôs case) ambiguity of the danger and threat are what makes cosmic horror great. Despite his writing that Cthulhu, Dagon, or Shub-Niggurath are horrid and mind-numbing in their incomprehensibility, they‚Äôre still physical. I can grasp an Octopus god, or an evil creature from the sea. These horror icons are still, well, horrors; something to a great extent, understandable. 

This is where Chambers shines, in my opinion. The King in Yellow‚Äôs ‚Äúantagonist‚Äù is not inherently a scary thing. It is a play which drives those who read it mad. But something that Chambers never lets go of is the King in Yellow‚Äôs ambiguity, its dangerous ‚Äúotherworldliness‚Äù. We only receive snippets of the work, and nothing of its terrible second act. The dangers of many horror creatures are dispelled by knowing about them (The Shadow Over Innsmouth‚Äôs monsters, Cthulhu, IT,  - these are fears that are for the most part explained, and we begin to know how they work).  Instead, we are given how the character reacts, how they respond to a world forever changed by the work‚Äôs horrid words. We begin to see these characters, people who are in one form or another, broken, horridly shattered again by the words on the King in Yellow‚Äôs pages. These four stories don‚Äôt show normal people evading a threat. They show people who are damaged and wounded, who are seeking calm and quiet, and then hunted by their own sins in the King in Yellow‚Äôs pages. Invariably, they do not escape.

Each of these short stories pulls from biblical texts and ideas of mythology to enchant the reader, ideas which reference, directly or not, common stories and themes. They have an almost familiar quality to them, as if the fears put within The King in Yellow was something startling familiar, that we ourselves have dreamed or experienced. Lovecraft could create a monster, and his works are undeniable in their range and influence. But Chambers creates something greater than that in his story - a dread and feeling of malaise as dark and as numinous as the King in Yellow himself, something which will linger with your soul for as long as you remember the cold winds on the lake of Hali, the black stars hanging in the sky, the towers behind the moon in Carcosa, and the pervading words of The King in Yellow. 

(To boot, the six other stories featured in the King in Yellow which do not directly relate to it are wonderful as well. Though they are far more romance oriented - of which Chambers was famous for - they feature an amazing quality of genuine emotion and feeling. In particular, The Demoiselle D‚ÄôYs is my favorite literary work, ever. It‚Äôs fucking amazing.)

TL;DR: Read the King in Yellow.",books,4910

Lovecraft could create a monster, and his works are undeniable in their range and influence. But Chambers creates something greater than that in his story - a dread and feeling of malaise as dark and as numinous as the King in Yellow himself, something which will linger with your soul for as long as you remember the cold winds on the lake of Hali, the black stars hanging in the sky, the towers behind the moon in Carcosa, and the pervading words of The King in Yellow. 

(To boot, the six other stories featured in the King in Yellow which do not directly relate to it are wonderful as well. Though they are far more romance oriented - of which Chambers was famous for - they feature an amazing quality of genuine emotion and feeling. In particular, The Demoiselle D‚ÄôYs is my favorite literary work, ever. It‚Äôs fucking amazing.)

TL;DR: Read the King in Yellow.",books,4926
"There's always been great adaptations of source material and poor adaptations. But what's really amazing to me is the amount of great works of literature that are yet to be adapted into film or 'television'.

I would imagine most of us have read novels, many of them decades old and have noticed that they are yet to be turned into a script. There are obviously a number of different potential reasons why something great has yet to become a film or show; be it deemed too risky financially or too hard to transport the novel's imagined world onto the screen.",books,559
"I‚Äôm sure this subreddit is getting an influx of Dune posts, but I‚Äôve been playing interested in Dune for awhile and the new trailer his piqued my interest. I hear people say it‚Äôs hard to get through though.

I was satisfied with it at the end, but was wondering if aspects of that book and Dune were comparable.",books,478
His book Swan Song was pretty easy to find and I noticed a couple of his others were too.

"I‚Äôve had so many people tell me I should read Dune and I‚Äôve never gotten around to it - the trailer that just dropped looks pretty awesome, but now I‚Äôm not sure if I should hurry up and read or if I should wait and watch the movie first and then dive into the book for more detail. Maybe this can‚Äôt really be answered without the movie already being out...

I did the same thing with the Martian, and was very happy to have read the book first. That said, the Martian book to movie conversion was pretty flawless. I‚Äôve heard that previous attempts to make Dune in not-book form weren‚Äôt that hot.

"Those are harder to find, don't you think? Because either the girl is a do-good, naive one or a tough, feisty-er one. At least those are the main tropes-- correct me if im wrong. I *do* love a sassy spitfire female who's confident as fuck and owns it, but sometimes a sweeter one is more refreshing. Though not the kind that lets everyone walks over her... just that her personality is softer. And it's cool to see her scarier bad-ass side like 'in your face!' attitude. Same with boys. but different. I lean towards a milder, not quite as bad-boy kind at times. Hot, caring, thoughtful, sensitive (swoon) with a vulnerable side, but has a hidden alpha side too. But also, the sexy asshole ones are so...

"I remember reading a book in the past year about a dog that walks on her hind legs, and can glide like a flying chipmunk for a few seconds because of a fold of skin under its arms. The series probably only had 2 books, and the dog like creature had all of her family killed because of hunters. The animal was very rare, almost all of her kind was dead from mass killings cause of their extremely soft fur, the kind of animal it was didn't have a related name to dog, and I can't remember her real name. She saved an animal from a boat in the sea that soon becomes her friend, and the animal was short, big eyes, with huge ears.

I'm reading *Kolyma Stories* a collection of short stories written by Shalamov about his time in the Gulag. The stories are powerful. The writing is meat and potatoes so to speak but it is really personal and relatable in its style. The translation is beautiful with many sections where the translator clearly had to be on his game. The stories are really gripping and they pull you into the setting beautifully. I wonder why this work is not popular? I believe it compares favourably to Solzhenitsyn at the very least it should nbe shelved alongside *The Gulag Archipelago.* Shalamov remains out of sight for most people and that's a shame.,books,641
"And it was amazing! And i personally think everyone should give it a read. The story is about a group of farm animals who are going against their human farmer. In doing so, they are trying to create a society  where the animals can be equal, free, and happy. Things dont go as planned for the animals, and the farm ends up in a state as bad as it was before, or maybe even worse. 

The themes of this book are very political, in a very satirical way. Everything from manipulating the rules, to making deals with other humans, lying about deaths and making secret  alliances, it shows what can happen when people, (pigs) get too much power. 

The 7 commandments: Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy, whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend, no animal shall wear clothes, no animal shall sleep in bed, no animal shall drink alcohol, no animal shall kill any other animal and all animals are equal. The way the pig leaders on the farm constantly change the commandments using propaganda was very interesting. And there is one quote that i think is more important and relevant than all the others, when the leader pigs have taken control over the other animals and changed all of the 7 commandments:

 "" All animals are equal, but some are more equal than others""",books,1279

"There might be something I'm missing here, but I'm wondering why the ebook isn't included with the hard copy at this point. Retail is dying, more people are moving to ebooks and audiobooks every year that goes by. Why not give some incentive to by the hard copy?

I really enjoy collecting books. I like the cover art, the feeling of sitting on the couch and reading an actual piece of paper. We spend every waking moment staring at screens, and it feels great to take a break from that with a book. 

That being said, every time I buy a relatively long book, I end up wanting the audiobook and ebook anyway. I want the audiobook for the car, and the ebook for my computer and phone for basically any time I am away from my couch or bed. 

I've already spent $20 on the book, plus my $15/month Audible subscription (which I just can't give up even though I also use Overdrive/Libby, since many books that I read are always 8 weeks out or not on there at all).

I just feel like once the book has been purchased, we shouldn't have to spend $10-$15 on a 600kb ebook file. It would also seemingly help the struggling retailers.. although I'm guessing the publishers would rather let them die out and sell everything through Amazon anyway..",books,1236

"I don't just mean giving their characters a gruesome early death GRRM-style, but when the writer writes a character whose story could've been really interesting and then never bothers to develop it. (Usually dropping it in favor of a character who is really boring.)

I've always hated Madeline L'Engle for doing this to Zachary Gray in A Ring of Endless Light. For those who haven't read it: basically, it's about a teen girl choosing between 3 guys, he's one of the 3 guys. I empathized with him a lot because he spends the book being suicidal due to his rich-but-emotionally-neglectful family, having an entire town of wholesome salt-of-the-earth types hate him because one of theirs died trying to save his ""spoiled"" ass from a suicide attempt, and desperately latching onto the female lead because she's a nice girl from a loving family who is at first sympathetic to him. The author just presents him as a ""bad boy"" for the lead to be initially attracted to, but in the end righteously choose against. I mean, I'm not saying he necessarily should have ended as her boyfriend, but L'Engle could've  shown what happened to him instead of just completely dropping his story. Well, not completely: he shows up in a later book where he's not suicidal anymore (no reason given) but still a jerk the reader is supposed to hate. Because in a world where the main characters mostly come from good healthy families, let's all hate on the person who had a bad childhood and is emotionally damaged from it.

That being said: writers can also shortchange their characters by being too sympathetic to them. Jordan in Color Me In  by Natasha Diaz was this, I think. She's a dark-skinned black girl who is extremely ""woke"" and gives the biracial main character a hard time, in part because the guys around them are rejecting Jordan in favor of fetishizing the MC's light skin. You feel for her, because she really has suffered a lot due to racism, but she's also a master at using social justice jargon for personal social gain, the kind of person who will be trying to destroy lives left and right on social media for microagressions, if she isn't doing so already. In the hands of another, better writer, she would've been a fascinating sympathetic villain. Instead, by the end of the book she's presented as just having been right all along about everything. Too bad, because she could have been the most interesting character in the book.

Anyone else get super annoyed when they see a writer shortchange their character like this?",books,2525
"I'm not a part of this community or at least of yet, I enjoy books but I have a more solid enjoyment for writing (which can be a downside a lot of the time because I haven't broken up my time to read a lot).

But I was reading The Things They Carried by Tim O'Brien, and I kind of got a little bit of a surprise when I noticed that they listed off what they carried a lot, and I saw that as an info dump quality.  But now that I see an ""info dump"" being projected in the first chapter of the popular story, I'm starting to question whether I know what an info dump actually is.

If ""Listing off what they carried"" perhaps is an info dump, then, in what would be my opinion, this dumping of information could be the strength of that chapter. But ultimately, I'm still starting to question if this was a use of writing power, or I have info dumps all wrong and lists aren't bad.

Briefly said: does the first chapter contain info dumps? Do I not know what an info dump is and it's actually normal to list out everything at once? Is it genius writing work that converts the downside into strength because they ""Carried"" it? Or is it something else entirely? I mean, ultimately it's the reader that converts this knowledge to what they know and such, but I really just want to know if I know what's going on here.

"Hello fellow book lovers,


Hello fellow book lovers,

As many of you have likely seen the¬†PNW¬†is under siege from the many wildland fires in the area. Each year the fires blaze through Oregon, California and Washington so this is not something unique to 2020. The circumstances that lead to this moment however are unique in that a¬† historic wind storm the likes of which hasn't been seen in over 50 years has ripped through the state causing downed trees and power lines and pushing the fires that are not contained even further into our communities.

My town is now under level 1 evacuation orders. This means it's time to prepare for the order to leave. It will be impossible to take everything with us, there just isn't enough room. I¬†have a decent¬†sized book collection (always wanting more!) and will have to choose only a few to take with me. My question is how do you choose? Which books would you take with you¬†in the event of¬†an evacuation such as this? 

Stay safe out there PNW buddies ‚ù§",books,1000
"Hello,

Writers mostly count numbers of words because the pages size and the space between the lines affect the numbers of page needed to display those words. A 100'000 words novel will have more or less 300 pages in 12 time new roman, double space line.

As for Fantasy and Sci-Fi, the usual word count is about 150'000 or about 450 pages.

&amp;#x200B;

For the longest of time, paperback book were the only viable option and printing a 300'000 words book in 900 pages was out of the question or would have result in the book costing 50 USD. And not that many people are willing to try out a book from a random author with no back ground library and risk 50 USD to find either a good or bad book. It's not a good gamble.

But with Ebook, the numbers of pages doesn't increase price because they are pdf. So more pages doesn't mean higher price range. Many authors release as many books as they can to have more books to sell, but is it really a good thing story wise to split book into smaller one?

I'm a financial analyst and as a hobby, I've been writing medieval dark fantasy for about 4 years. I have a full book completed (750 pages, 250'000 words), I did the first full edit and passed it to my 3 beta readers to get feed back before editing it again. The book was well received, but, 2 out of 3 beta readers said that I should split it in 2 books instead of one to release them one after the other and have a better marketing for the release. 

Again, I don't write for money and it feels wrong to me to split it in half. 

&amp;#x200B;

How would you react towards a book with 750+ pages for about 250'000 words from a complete stranger? Would the page numbers turn you away? 

Would you rather read many small books?",books,1741
"I have dozens of other things that I need to complete today, but I don't want to do those. I want to go on a brief rant to no one about *Gideon the Ninth*. I saw this book mentioned on various book sites and it was available at my library, so I figured I'd give it a go. Overall, I liked it and I will read the sequel, but I was annoyed by a few things.


**Book Blurbs**

These are always dumb and I know it is to get someone to read the synopsis in the hopes that they then buy it, to catch that someone will just see on the cover that ""George RR Martin says ‚ÄòThis. Kicks. Ass.‚Äô"" and be like ""He wrote GoT!!!! Dope. I'll take 2."" I took special exception to some of the blurbs on *Gideon the Ninth* for some reason.

&gt; (on the front cover) ""Lesbian necromancers explore a haunted gothic palace in space! Decadent nobles vie to serve the deathless Emperor! Skeletons!"" - Charles Stross. 

1.	First, everywhere I saw talk about this book, they mentioned lesbians. After reading the book, the sexual preferences of characters felt like an afterthought that did not have an impact on the plot. I think ""necromancers explore a haunted gothic palace in space"" is already pretty niche, and would get the book into the right hands. I want more lgbt friendly media and literature, especially in the sci-fi/fantasy genre, but they way the book was marketed (or at least what I saw of the marketing) feels cheap after reading the book. I don‚Äôt identify as lgbt. I would like to learn more about if this is a common thing with lgbt representation in media. Is this a healthy or helpful way for that representation to occur? I know there are better books to read if I am looking for lgbt representation, but I am wanting to learn what people think about this approach. Was it used as marketing or was it fair and representative?
2.	 Second, Decadent nobles makes me expect the vampire league from Twilight. I would not describe anything in this book as decadent. There was one dinner party that was described as a dinner my family would try to throw that has the intention of being something major, but really, it‚Äôs just my mother-in-law making the same meal she was going to make on Sunday regardless of whether my sister-in-law brought a fruit salad or not.
3.	Finally, ""Skeletons!"" Well, I was on the fence at this point Charles, but you really sold me with this note! Can you hear necromancers and not assume skeletons?


&gt; ""Goofy and gleaming; a profane Daria in space."" - Robin Sloan 

Daria would snark the ever-loving shit out of this book. I don't think so. 


&gt; ""This crackling, inventive, and riotous book from an original voice is a genuine pleasure. Also, the author is clearly insane."" - Warren Ellis

The first part is fine, but come on. That last bit is terrible.


&gt; ""Necromancers! Dueling! Mayhem! *Gideon the Ninth* is disturbing and delightful in equal measure"" - Yoon Ha Lee

""Dueling!"" well, shit. Combine this with the ""Skeletons!"" on the front and I'm surprised this didn't sell a billion copies. 

In summary, this book is ""goofy, crackling, inventive, gleaming, disturbing, and delightful and it's kind of like Daria, but with lesbians, skeletons, and dueling."" It is also written by ""an insane person."" WTF? Get your shit together and sort out what this is. They act like this is some completely undefinable book that couldn't be fathomed before it was written. Settle down, ToR.

**the book itself - just like 2 weird editing things**


* Page 378, at the end of the chapter a character says, ""We can't do anything for them. The living have to take precedence here, if we want to keep living."" Then the next line to end the chapter was, ""As it turned out, he was wrong."" I am not sure if this writing device has a name (where they kill any tension building by using Arrested Development narrator voice), but this was the first and only time I remember it appearing in the book. This book is like 450 pages long. Why introduce this 80% of the way through? It was really jarring.


* I don‚Äôt like characters that are the type that say or do provocative things just because, but I think the author did a good job with it here. The MC had a lot happen in their life and you could tell they had empathy in the right moments, so the provocative stuff was just a shield. This made it really frustrating when the MC ignored this and it felt like the attitude was used for a gag. 

    For example, a character dies and the MC is witness to it. When the MC goes to tell the deceased character‚Äôs partner, instead of the empathy coming through, or the character growing and being direct, the MC opts for a lame joke. Yes, the MC uses humor as a shield, but they didn‚Äôt need to here. It wasn‚Äôt set up for that. While it was a let down the MC opted for the joke, the most frustrating part is that it wasn‚Äôt reflected on or addressed at all. Everyone just moved on from it like it didn‚Äôt matter. It wasn‚Äôt a huge deal, but again, it took me out of the writing and the character where I had to pause and be like, ‚Äúwhat the hell? Did I miss something?‚Äù

Again, I liked the book. I‚Äôll pick up the sequel at some point. I just wanted to avoid working and this was more satisfying to do than my next real task.",books,5220

"Have you ever been turned off from a book series that you'd been enjoying because it made a twist or turn or decision that you just couldn't stomach? Did you stick with the series, or did you NOPE right out of there?

So I'm taking an online course about mystery and suspense literature, and the lecturer strongly recommends the Dexter series by Jeff Lindsay. My library carries the whole series, so I picked up *Darkly Dreaming Dexter* and was immediately sucked in. (More by the character than by the plot, TBH.) I devoured it in short order and returned to the library post haste to grab the second and third books in the series (*Dearly Devoted Dexter* and *Dexter in the Dark*, respectively). Book #2 had its issues, but was still enjoyable throughout...

...and then book #3 lost me from the very first chapter, by introducing a new element to the story that was WAY out of left field. I slammed the book shut and said ""Nope, nope, not doing this.""

"
So I read Dune by Frank Herbert and I was very impressed. I loved the characters in the book such as Paul and his mother and the way they grew throughout the book. The scale of the book seemed very large, but most of the action still happened within the focus of the book. 

Then I read Dune Messiah, and it had a very different feel to it. Most of the action happened outside of the actual focus of the book, and the characters I cared about became kind of stale in my opinion.

"Hey guys!


I downloaded the whole of Lovecraft Fiction, thinking I'm in for a treat.. and I gotta say that my impression of the first story - The Nameless City - is pretty low.


Firstly, the sentences have no flow at all and there is frequent repetition of the same words in nearby sentences (which is usually bad and indicative of poor vocabulary.). The whole thing is filled with fancy schmancy words (as a non-native speaker, I had to look up like 10 or so words) which, in contrast with the rest of the story, seems just like showing off. Same with mentioning random gods and historical figures. My showoff alarm is going off. Dude trying to be Plato or something. The two passages he ""cites"", are literal dogs_it, no offense. They don't rhyme, make no sense, and if there is any supposed rhythm being created, it is only by short'ng words heavily.



I seriously feel that I could write something like this with no problems. It's such bad quality. You solve they mystery a mile away, and the ending is just stupid. The beginning is full of filler, writing the same thing in 20 different ways, while completely failing at actually describing anything or creating a sense of mystery or curiosity in the reader.



So my question for you is whether I should bother with the rest of the stories? 


If they are not at least 500% better, then I think not. I have just come from reading Tolkien, and I don't wanna offend anybody, but what I have in The Nameless City is f-tier dogsh_t.


Thanks!",books,1496

"So I read Dune by Frank Herbert and I was very impressed. I loved the characters in the book such as Paul and his mother and the way they grew throughout the book. The scale of the book seemed very large, but most of the action still happened within the focus of the book. 

Then I read Dune Messiah, and it had a very different feel to it. Most of the action happened outside of the actual focus of the book, and the characters I cared about became kind of stale in my opinion. Yes the political intrigue was interesting, but the story of the first book outdid that of the second by a lot. 

I have 3 questions for discussion then. First, did you guys think the same way about the first 2 books? Second, is there a key element which I may have missed about these books (I did read them about 6 months ago so I am forgetting some of my original thoughts about the books). Third, what do you guys think of the following books in the series; are they worth the read?",books,964
"Are there any online tools for reading comprehension. For example, if I am reading Dune is there a resource to ask thought provoking questions as I go through the book? Similar to reading in a book club, but just an online resource that I can use at my own pace? I dont need to read the clif notes, but would rather ask myself thought provoking questions to stimulate engagement. Any advice is appreciated!",books,406

The greatest books are defined as classics for a reason. Written by the greatest literary minds of their time, they have universal themes, characters, experiences, emotions and perspectives that are still relevant today. Some of them are the very inspiration from which entire modern genres of literary fiction have sprung up from.

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone should read at least once for these 30 books ‚Äî some are well known classics, others are modern giants. ¬†All are well worth reading at least once in your life!

## 1. To Kill a Mockingbird,¬†by Harper Lee

&amp;#x200B;

Published in 1960, this timeless classic explores human behaviour and the¬†collective conscience of The Deep South in the early 20th century. Humour entwines the delicate strands of prejudice, hatred, hypocrisy, love and innocence to create one of the best novels ever written.

## 2. 1984,¬†by George Orwell

Although 1984 has passed us by, George Orwell‚Äôs¬†dystopian,¬†totalitarian world of control, fear and lies¬†has never been more relevant. Delve into the life of Winston Smith¬†as he struggles with¬†his developing human nature in a world where individuality, freewill and love¬†are forbidden.

## 3. Harry Potter and the Philosopher‚Äôs Stone,¬†by J.K. Rowling

I‚Äôm willing to bet you‚Äôve heard of Harry Potter, but have you read the books? Join Harry Potter as he begins his journey into the world of magic, where he is the celebrated Boy Who Lived. Visit Hogwarts, meet your favourite characters and watch Harry grow into the one of the most famous literary characters in the world.

## 4. The Lord of the Rings,¬†by J.R.R. Tolkien

Middle Earth is a wonderful, expansive fantasy world filled with turmoil, heroes, evil and innocence. Although our protagonist Frodo Baggins‚Äô quest seems impossible to complete, this trilogy is a tale of triumph in the most impossible circumstances.

## 5. The Great Gatsby,¬†by F. Scott Fitzgerald

Published in 1925, Fitzgerald‚Äôs *The Great Gatsby* explores the decadence¬†of the Jazz Age, and one man‚Äôs introduction into a world where even those with the most indulgent lives cannot earn love.

## 6. Pride and Prejudice,¬†by Jane Austen

One of the most famous novels of all time, Pride And Prejudice details¬†the courtship of two opposed characters in a world where manners and courtesy are of the utmost importance.",books,2324
"Or at least explain the opposite point of view to me. One of my favorite parts about reading is the physical manifestation of the act - seeing the fruits of my labor in a broken-in paperback, putting it away to step back and admire how much I've read. I am VERY attached to my bookshelf. I am not usually one to lend/gift/donate books but I want to get there. I don't think of myself as a hoarder (I have space to place them and they give me joy) but when I see other people defending downsizing I feel kind of ashamed of myself.",books,529
"Everyone who loves sci fi seems to recommend this book, but about a third of the way through it, my reaction has just been that it's really poorly written. It seems like it constantly violates the rule of ""show, don't tell"" because it seems like every three paragraphs a character is doing an aside about how they feel about some person or treachery. As a result, the narrative style constantly reminds me of this iconic [Futurama scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFBhR4QcBtE). Obviously it's not poorly written given its stature and acclaim, but I can't help but being taken aback by what seems like a constant violation of the ""show, don't tell"" rule.

Surely I'm not the only one who feels this way?

I tend to not like tv shows where they have a protagonist describing things either (think Dexter), so maybe that's just a personal preference thing?",books,858

The trailer for the new Dune adaptation has finally been released. Overall, I think it looks encouraging in the sense of graphics and settings. It really looks how I imagined Arrakis and the graphics look amazing, especially considering the graphics in the 1980s film. 

I do have some concerns of how it will live up to the novel in terms of casting. I know Timothee Chalamet and Zendaya are the new hit people in Hollywood, but are they the best for Paul and Chani? They also appear to be combining the characters of the beast Rabban and Feyd-Rautha, which I think is an odd decision. 

What do you think about the new adaptation and what are your concerns?",books,751
"I‚Äôm aware of a previous post on the r/history subreddit in which someone recommended Johnathon Sumption‚Äôs series. His books seem to have what I want in terms of being easy to read but I‚Äôm particularly cautious about reading books that are potentially ‚Äúout of date‚Äù (the first book in the series being released thirty years ago). History is a field in a constant flux of new information and I‚Äôd like have the up to date story. I‚Äôd also like recommendations for books on late medieval and early modern Europe with an emphasis on monarchies, particularly Britain, France and ‚ÄòGermany‚Äô (Holy Roman Empire).",books,602
"I'll be honest this genre isn't my wheelhouse as I'm primarily a reader of high fantasy but a few years ago kindle recommended a book called Guilty by Association which I ended up loving by this author.  Needless to say when I found out he published another book I was excited and curious.  It in many ways can be read without reading the other but it many ways it's book 2. 

It follows main character Nick Burke who's profession is questionable at best bordering on vigilante.  Along the way you get to see him go through internal struggles and climb mountainous fears in ways of love and intimacy.  Also you are introduced to the small crew that usually accompanies him on his oddball missions of justifying those who fell through the cracks which are a fun lot. 

Its has a few tie ins with GbA but they're all explained in the novel without the need to read the first. 

All in all it's an action/ thriller I guess is what you'd classify it as. The fight sequences have a realism I absolutely loved there were a few scenes throughout the book that were a bit iffy but I generally loved it.  Easily a 4/5",books,1108
"Hello! I‚Äôm compiling a list of all the books I‚Äôve read so far in quarantine (I‚Äôm almost at 20!!!) and one title escapes me. I was hoping to get some help remembering it!

It‚Äôs one of the Gabriel Allon novels by Daniel Silva, and in it he recruits an American woman to go undercover on the mega yacht of a terrorist leader. I looked at all the titles and synopses on good reads but I can‚Äôt remember which one that was!!!

Do any of you remember?",books,444
"This is my first Murakami and I LOVED it. It's a 4/5 for me. I love his writing. I think it's very  cozy and elegant and atmospheric. Others described it as *dreamlike* or *dreamy* and I definitely agree on that. I was very immersed the whole time. I thought about it a lot after I finished reading. I kinda ""analyzed"" it and here are some of my thoughts:

- The story itself isnt that great but the writing is just so beautiful. This book left me with an unexplainable feeling and I love it when I get that from a book. 

- I totally understand other people who hate the characters. I think the characters are terrible people. Maybe because they are teenagers lol. They are very easy to hate. The MC is a terrible guy. Naoko as well. Nagasawa is a jerk. Midori is weird (but I love her). Reiko is okay until the last part. Stormtrooper is probably the best character.

- Midori is weird. But I really liked her. When I thought about it, her character is not really that likeable irl. If I meet a girl IRL that talks a lot about sexual stuff even if she has a boyfriend, I probably would stay away from her. But I LIKED Midori. It's weird. This is the first time I actually liked a character from a book. I was always looking forward to her scenes. A lot of times when she's not on the scene I find myself turning the pages to see how many pages before I 'see' her again. This is the first time I felt that on a fictional character. 

- I loved MC and Midori's relationship. I'm happy that they fell inlove with each other but I think it would be fine for me as well even if they just remained best friends and MC and Naoko ended up together.

- I wish Murakami thought of a better way of removing Stormtrooper from the story.

- I didnt hate Reiko until the last few pages. I would probably give this book a 5/5 but the last part threw it. The sex scene with Reiko is unnecessary imo. A lot of sex scenes are actually unnecessary but it's an erotic novel so yeah


I havent read a lot of good books. I only started reading as a hobby this quarantine. Maybe thats why I'm so inlove with this book even with its flaws and imperfections. This is also my first time writing my thoughts about a book that I liked so I'm sorry if it's messy. MIDORI BEST WAIFU.",books,2255

Oscar Wilde once said ""If one cannot enjoy reading a book over and over again, there is no use in reading it at all"". I am sure most of the readers would agree with Mr. Wilde. Unfortunately, in the recent times, books belonging to this special class have lost traction. Mentioned below are the top 5 top reasons why people reread certain books.

&amp;#x200B;

1. One of the most common reasons which many readers offer for their rereading affinity is powerful story. It not only beckons them to take another shot at the work but instantly drags them within the pages and transforms them into a participant. It is this virtue which coerces the reader time and again. This kind of literature usually finds its way into bibliophile's collection.

&amp;#x200B;

2. Earlier, especially in the 70's and early 80's few books were printed, and there were fewer authors. It was also difficult to buy books due to its unfriendly price tag. To overcome this hurdle, most readers built a mini library which was exploited innovatively. Owners of these personal libraries either exchanged literary works with friends and relatives or reread interesting ones. These private libraries flourished in every neighborhood. Interestingly, some of them transformed into commercial entities especially those which had a large collection of books.

&amp;#x200B;

3. Then there are readers who swear by God that every time they reread one of their cherished books they gained a newer insight into the author's writing style, story and characterization. Of course, most of them believe that it is age related thing. For example, some of classic literature which forms a part of school / college curriculum is way beyond the understanding young minds. However, a decade down the line, the same books depict a different tale. As one reader pointed out that it was all about a matured mindset which develops with age.

&amp;#x200B;

4. Empathetic and compelling character/s, especially those with whom we can easily relate to, and connect with is yet another common reason for rereading. It is this connection which draws readers to the book again and again, at times to fetch inspiration and at times to compliment the author for its outstanding characterization.

&amp;#x200B;

5. Dog eared books are like muses. They seduce readers and then allow them to recapture some of the chapters, scenes or passages of a novel. When a reader marks the page during the first read it simply means that this person will return one day. It is a signal that the particular part of the story has somehow made its way to the reader's heart. Incidentally, in these contemporary times most of the book lovers use bookmarks which somehow dilute the intensity, the passion with which the page was marked.

&amp;#x200B;

So, why do you reread if at all you do? And do you believe it is an unfair practice because these books are ""Gods of Literature"" and many new authors lose out a sale because of them.",books,3224
"I first got into Doctorow's fiction in the mid-2000s. Some time around 2012, I got my last Doctorow book - For the Win. At the time all his books were free for download on his site and he had all this information about fan translations and fans converting the books to various ebook formats because it was all Creative Commons. Around the time of Walkaway (some time in the last 3 years? Or maybe time is REALLY flying by), I went back to his site craphound and now all the books are only available for purchase. Nothing about fan translations or different ebook formats .

Did I miss some news story or blog post where he declared that Creative Commons wasn't working for him anymore?",books,685
" I recently finished the last book, Dispel Illusion, in the Impossible Times book series by Mark Lawrence and wish it was not over!

Did this series peak your interest in playing D&amp;D",books,346
I‚Äôm curious how people feel about them as I‚Äôm recently listening to the audible books and at first I thought it was a fun little bit. The further in I get into Fellowship at least the more poetry and music happens and it tends to lose my interest and then I find myself missing info being distracted by a passing butterfly. The writing is fantastic and I feel like I maybe don‚Äôt have the proper admiration for the poetry/music,books,426
"I think objectively it was well written and I understand why other people might like it.  But I've read a lot of  post-apocalyptic fiction and for me there wasn't anything that made it special.  I think the hype might of ruined it for me.  I don't feel like reading it again.  If you didn't like it and you have read it recently could you explain to me why you didn't like it?  

Or if you did like it but feel that you have insight into why someone who reads a lot of books from the genre might not like it?

For myself I just remember feeling that it didn't stand out.  I remember thinking that people were reading this book that didn't normally read post-apocalyptic fiction and being blown away by a lot of things that are pretty well trodden territory for the long time fan.  I enjoyed The Road, A Canticle for Leibowitz, World War Z, The Girl with all the Gifts, and many countless books that are more action oriented and pulpy. 

I don't think that Station 11 is a bad book. It is a good book.  But I don't like it when it is held up as THE book to represent the genre.  I really don't like that.  I might however recommend the book to a someone who i wanted to dip their toes in and didn't want to overwhelm.

"*The Strange Case of Jekyll Hyde* is one of the most popular books representing split personalities and the conflicting moralities in every person, even though that's not what the book is about.

As many well know, Mr. Hyde is not a separate person or personality from Dr. Jekyll, it is but a mask for him to wear to indulge in his secret desires without fear of retribution from Victorian society.

Modern interpretations of the story have changed the narrative that Hyde is the physical and/or mental embodiment of Jekyll's id, an uncontrollable monster fueled by desire and emotion. These types are shown in movies like the League of Extraordinary gentlemen or any Looney Tunes cartoon.

The other popular variation is a mixture of the two former. A human being in shape, but a creature in actions. A differing personality to Jekyll, but closer to Jack the Ripper than the Incredible Hulk. Mild mannered Jekyll is taken over by the evil personality inside every man. An example of this is the criminally underrated Jekyll and Hyde musical.

What I want to ask is, what is your favorite variation? Either to read, watch, write, hear, anything. The classic mask of desires in the form of a short ugly man, a hulk-like beast of emotion, or the evil inside of every man that becomes a crazed killer?",books,1298
"Firstly, I'd like to give a shout out to all of you who have recently posted about East Of Eden. There were so many overwhelmingly positive experiences that I ordered it, read it and loved it.¬†

I usually read around 600/700 pages a week but this has been the first time I've read every single word of a book. Nobody has made me feel both optimistic and depressed when thinking about love and experience the way Steinbeck has done in this novel. You know when you tear up a bit thinking about true beauty, whether it's a moment, piece of art or an abstract idea? That's how I feel about this book, so thanks to everyone who posted about it!!

Secondly, I just want to reiterate my gratitude for those who post/comment/share experiences or suggestions on here. Not many of my friends read these days so it's comforting coming here and seeing what other book lovers are up to.¬†

And that's it! Haha. I'll take what I've learned from Steinbeck and let you know that I have a bit of love for all of the readers out there. Cheers :)",books,1027

"I think a lot of people have the same issue that I had where I struggled to maintain interest in titles. I like the idea of reading a book on the history of the AK47, the human gut biome, Asian postcolonial economics, and titles of classic literature but struggled to maintain genuine interest. 

After all, how much do I *really* need to know about such niche topics? Do I maintain the knowledge I am trying to absorb?

I found that with audiobooks I have been able to put less stress on myself and fall into enjoying listening about such topics and actually finishing book after book. I have a couple of Audiobook apps that I am subscribed to, but I will put out a quick plug: Scribd is the best one I have encountered for the value. It doesn't limit your titles (i think it caps full downloads of audiobooks per month but you can always stream) and I have been pleasantly surprised over the past three years of using it how many popular titles are in the library. There are also print titles. 

The app isn't great and crashes... Eh, pretty frequently. But for the price per month ($10) it's my favorite monthly subscribed entertainment source that I pay for. 

just wanted to share because $15 per downloadable title by the company-who-must-not-be-named makes me feel punched in the gut sometimes. there's no reason to ration one book per month, what an anemic service",books,1372

"I'm aware of a few similar posts but in my case, I've recently pulled some books off of my bookshelf and I have noticed they have deformed into a sort of 'S' shape.   


Am I packing my books together too tightly? I have loosened them up since but I used to pack them tightly. I think perhaps the deformation has occurred when making room for a new book. The bottom of the existing books are stationary until I push the top of the book one way or the other which causes the book to drag, hence the 'S' shape.  


Is this plausible?",books,531
"Thanks to a post created by u/unklethan a few days ago, I was convinced about buying new books to support authors and bookshops. Usually, I'm of the mind to just shop at the thrift store or use my library. However, being a very slow reader, the library just makes me anxious as I struggle to finish before the due date. 

As I read only about 12 books or less per year, I'm very selective with what I read. The other day I paid $26 to watch Tenet in IMAX, so I figured that if I paid the cost of a book for 2 hours of entertainment, why do I see the cost of an actual book as a waste? I have switched my thought to think of this as a purchase of an experience instead. And several hours of experience, especially for slow readers like me. 

Another great thing with this is that once I'm done with the book, I can hand over the book to someone else whom I think might enjoy. 

I bought two new books today from my local retailer and it was completely empty. Its a shame really. As someone who loves retro things, I already miss stuff like browsing for films in the video store or listening to the latest albums at a Virgin Megastore. So I might as well savour as much of this experience of browsing for books in a shop before they shit down as well. I have narrowed down my purchases to buy memoirs, books written by New York Times journalists/editors and novels written by Indian authors (that's my heritage). And of course, I'll just use my kindle for the all else.",books,1467

"I've recently been getting into reading again lately and I am running into the same problem that always leads to my inevitable withdrawal from books. I love novels but I often get confused while reading them because I can't take in the exposition material.

This seems weird to me because when I read paragraphs of dialogue, I can almost perfectly recall what was written. But then when I go onto read paragraphs of exposition, none of the material sticks. This combination leads to much frustration as I need to read exposition paragraphs multiple times over whereas I need only one attempt to read dialogue paragraphs. It's almost as if my brain goes blank when the characters aren't speaking.

I don't know how to fix the problem because whether it's dialogue or exposition, I feel as if I'm reading the same way. But only the dialogue results in my brain ""clicking"" with the material.

If anyone has any suggestions on how to fix this problem, It would be greatly appreciated.",books,980
"*Nausea* by Jean-Paul Sartre was exhausting. Truly. But even more than that, it was very repulsive at times. Like, I would do anything rather than pick up the book and read another page.

For those yet unaware of the plot, here is the blurb from the back cover of the Penguin Classics version translated by Robert Baldick‚Äî

&gt; Nausea is both the story of the troubled life of a young writer, Antoine Roquentin, and an exposition of one of the most influential and significant philosophical attitudes of modern times - existentialism. The book chronicles his struggle with the realisation that he is an entirely free agent in a world devoid of meaning; a world in which he must find his own purpose and then take total responsibility for his choices. A seminal work of contemporary literary philosophy, nausea evokes and examines the dizzying angst that can come from simply trying to live.

The book begins in the form of mystery with an apparently simplistic protagonist‚Äî Antoine Roquentin. He has started feeling something, but cannot put into words what it is. (Spoiler: it is the Nausea). With this lead, he begins his epistolary narrative which takes the reader through the town of Bouville and its inhabitants.

Throughout the book, Roquentin perishes into a deep darkness (both literally and metaphorically) and the world around him makes less and lesser sense and he discovers the meaninglessness of life without its purpose.

Alongside, he also realises that until and unless *Things* are *defined* by others, the Things by themselves are nothing and can be anything. For example, one time while sitting in a tram, Roquentin realised that what he is sitting on is only called a*seat* because others perceive it to be so. According to him, it can be anything other than a seat; even a*donkey's belly*, and other people won't realise it because they have already accepted it as a *seat*. As Things start losing their natural integrity, he witnesses the presence of Things as **existences**; that too superfluous, because other than just *existing* those Things do not have any other meaning.

It was a deeply unsettling read, and one of Sartre's earliest and least-political works, as it was written before the Second World War, after which his philosophy of Existentialism inclined more and more towards Marxism with a vehement repulsion towards the bourgeois.",books,2370

I want to say so much because so much has happened.

Spoilers: &gt;!I overall really enjoyed it. I thought it had a lot of similarities to the Neapolitan Novels but a lot of differences. It seemed somewhat lighter than the NNs, but dealt with a lot of heavy topics. Giovanna is a depressed teenager dealing with a lot in the wake of her parents' ugly divorce and has become utterly unhinged from her feelings, as she states. 

The ending certainly perplexed me, as she chooses to keep her relationship with Roberto platonic and then loses her virginity to Rosario. The second part much more so.

"I just finished it and all I was left with was a ""meh"" feeling. Its a story. Not bad, but not great. I can see it being enjoyable to read as a pass-timer, however I was really intrigued as it has a Nobel prize of literature and other important prizes. I thought ""wow that must be a good book"".

I am truly wondering why did it win those awards? It just doesn't make any sense to me. I saw people claiming its great to portray human emotions. For me Virginia Woolf is better in that case. Others claimed its great for it being subtle about non-explicit events. For this I prefer crime novels. I also saw comments that the book is great for portraying the conflict Stevens goes through concerning his feelings and his ideas. It really is, but winning those prizes because of it? It seems too much for me.

Then I want to know, why do people claim it is amazing? What makes it worth it of those prizes? Do you think its just another story, like me, or do you also think its a great book everyone should read?",books,1005

"I‚Äôm about 123 pages in and this book is extremely tedious and rambly in its wordplay and frankly I‚Äôm just bored to death. It‚Äôs 960something pages I believe so the reason I‚Äôm posting is I‚Äôm hoping that it gets better at some point. I mean, it‚Äôs almost a thousand pages so I‚Äôm just gonna ask if it‚Äôs worth it to get through, or would I just waste 2 weeks of my life since I am not able to read daily?",books,398
"So I'm halfway through reading Orwell's 1984 and I can't help thinking that it is just a bit boring, rubbish even.  I would give it 3/10 thusfar which I believe is on the lenient side.  It is a classic and it gets a lot of hype and admiration.  It is near the top of every ""books to read before you die"" lists.  I am just wondering if most classics are like this and whether it is worth it to read any of them.  I originally studied 1984 in higher English in school just 2 years ago; of course I didn't actually read it, nor did I read any novel we ever studied.  However, I couldn't help but notice that the book is revered as one of the best so I thought I'd give it a real go, out of school.  What did you think about the book?",books,730
"So I'm entering the stage in my life where I want to give Leo Tolstoy a real go but I'm wondering which book I should read first? 

I'm quite familiar with the stories of both and am a bit of a Russian history nerd so I am really keen/excited but also have a bit of a fear of not finishing because of how overwhelmingly dense big books can be for slow readers like me lol.

I was just wondering if one was easier to tackle than the other and what have your experiences been with either of these? Any thoughts are appreciated!",books,525
"I have been impacted by depression and social anxiety most of my life.  In the past two years I have completely transformed from my younger self. Self-awareness is something I could of done without, living my entire life in the dark not knowing a lick of sense better. In this time of self-help I read that the best way to learn is to teach, so I wrote a book. A short and simple guide for self-help, if you are looking for a  quick read that sums up most self-help books, send me a PM for the link.",books,499
"Immaculately conceived and executed. Beautifully written in prose sculpted from selenian marble uprooted from the autumnal quarters of a skeletal desert. Existentially taut and harrowing‚Äîand yet exuberant in its own restrained, taciturn manner. An elemental journey wherein youthful immaturity and senescent wisdom intertwine and unravel with all of the fabric reality and celerity of unspooling life. McCarthy is incapable of penning a novel that is less than good, and this trilogy opener is *great*...",books,504
"I read this book series like a few years ago and I can't remember what it's called to save the life of me. It took place in a kingdom that was called something like Avalon. The main character was a 12-15 year old girl. Through-out the series, it is revealed that her parents aren't her parents and her really father is the king or leader of the series or whatever and he dies. She got a prophecy that he was going to die but she thought it was the man who she thought was her father. She also followed a butterfly after her father originally went missing. Does anyone know what series I'm talking about",books,602
"I had given up on books years ago but then decided to read again so I challenged myself to read 20 books this year (baby steps!). To make the story short, I finished my challenge 4 months earlier couldn‚Äôt be more happier. I know some people have a hard time to read again like me but don‚Äôt give up. You can do this! (Also thank you quarantine)",books,343
"Do you have any good anecdote or examples regarding what has worked well for you when learning something totally new? Key here is learning new skills or things and fast!

I have YouTubed for this and came across few good Ted Talks, but, I am hungry for more information and practical tips. Thanks for your time and sharing this in advance.

"I am looking for a book, but don't know which genre.
I like political books, biografies and books about our society, but I also like love storys and a little bit of thriller and fiction.
Can somebody suggest me any good books?
Are their any books you would say, everyone should have read in their lifes?

(English or German pls)",books,328
"I wanna hear the blend of book, scene and context that will never ever leave you. One of those moments you richly recall, knowing exactly where you were and what you were reading. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've got a a top 3, for kicks: 

&amp;#x200B;

1) Towards the end of The Amber Spyglass, Lyra and Will kiss. I was 10 years old in my auntie's London attic room; this was the steamiest love scene I had come across. Which probably means - first. Just two kids my age, kissing. The taste of strawberries.

&amp;#x200B;

2) Animal Farm in a two-day blast on an Italian mountaintop. I was 22. It remains my only Orwell, but I recall finishing it, gazing at the bluish valley mist, and craving a bacon sandwich. 

&amp;#x200B;

3) George Saunders' Pastoralia. Like many Saunders geeks, I was hooked early at university. The story in which a boy is electrocuted, then thrown from a roller coaster to a lion's den on a TV show called (roughly) Awful Things That Could Happen At Any Given Moment made me crack up fiercely. My friends were all watching a movie and couldn't hear it. At last I knew that great books should be funny, and funny books could be great. 

&amp;#x200B;

What else ya got, Redditors?",books,1195
"Ever since I read my first book, I have only ever read one book at a time. No matter how slow the book is, and I think it actually drains me sometimes especially if it is a heavy non-fiction. 

I really want to start reading a fiction and a non-fiction at the same time, but I don‚Äôt know why it scares me haha, I kinda worry I‚Äôll get too invested in one and end up reading only that (specifically the fiction), and then the other one won‚Äôt be read and by the time I finish the fiction I‚Äôll have forgotten all the important details of the non-fiction.

How do you balance reading two books? How do you make sure you don‚Äôt only end up reading one?

For some reason I feel like I‚Äôll be having an affair with a book by reading another one.

Eeeeee",books,743
"I picked this up last week after seeing some chat about it on Twitter and I found it to be one of the most eye-opening books I've read in a long time. It tells of the author's experience coming of age in London's gang culture whilst also studying for a degree in English, and it's this dichotomy which drives a lot of the book's uniqueness; the way he can be discussing Nietzche and the basis for morality by day and stabbing a rival gang member by night, all framed in this youth argot which is common in London but gives it a feel almost like A Clockwork Orange. One of my favourite passages is the opening one:

&gt;And jump out the whip and I'm hitting the pavement and it's this moment - when you jump out of the car and it's too late to go back - when you know that you're definitely gonna do it, even though the way the adrenaline bursts through your body makes you wish for a second that you weren't here. And now we're creeping up the street, she's too far ahead of us, we got the timing wrong but we can't run to catch up because that will alert her and she'll turn around, so we're creeping fast. The bally is hugging my face tight and I've also pulled my hood over it and I feel the adrenaline explode in the pit of my chest like a dying star and it's like my entire body has turned into the pumping of my heart.

Anyone else read it? What did you think?",books,1366
"Last year, one of my professors recommended this book to us and I‚Äôm so glad I finally got around to reading it. I think one of the reasons I enjoyed it so much is because it‚Äôs multidimensional. It contains literary analysis, an emotional autobiographical story and a crash course on what it means to teach and learn, all at the same time. 

&amp;#x200B;

The author does a masterful job choosing when to alternate between fragments about the Odyssey and stories from his own life and his father‚Äôs in order to avoid becoming too pedantic or, on the other side of the spectrum, overly sentimental. The way he draws parallels between the poem and his relationship with his father is spot on. Mendelsohn‚Äôs recollection about his father is very touching and poses some deep questions like ""how well can we truly know our parents?""

&amp;#x200B;

Also, if you haven‚Äôt read the Odyssey, Mendelsohn pretty much offers a summary of the poem throughout his book so you will still be able to understand pretty much everything. (However, I would still recommend reading the Odyssey as well because it‚Äôs great).",books,1098

"I've thought about this a few times. I think when I first really thought about it was when I read through all of the Game of Thrones books back in 2008. The following year I finally read the original Dune series. I couldn't help but feel like GRRM had to have read and been heavily influenced by many of the characters, plot points, and systems in Dune. Now I have started the Wheel of Time Series. I'm up to 'Shadow Rising' and I'm getting that feeling again. As  a kid/young teen I loved Harry Potter and now I'm reading and thinking ""okay...Rowling HAD to have read this right before she started Harry Potter"".

"I am currently rereading the Harry Potter series (fuck JKR but I still like the books) and I am aware that there have probably been lots and lots of threads about the various plot holes and weird things that don't make sense in those books. But still, I read them before my reddit time, actually before my internet time mostly and felt I needed to vent. Sorry about that. 

There are so many thinks especially plotwise that seem a bit stupid to me and I am willing to ignore many of those things but what annoys me so much right now is general world building stuff. Like how on earth can it be that Igor Karkaroff, a confessed death eater who was tried and convicted for torturing muggles, ended up spending about half a year in Azakaban for that crime and was later allowed to run a fucking school, teaching the dark arts to freaking children? All while a 15 year old kid like Harry Potter was threatened with expulsion and destruction of his wand, effectively excluding him from the magical community for the rest of his life without any hope for redemption, because he performed a patronus charm while being underage and in the presence of a muggle. I would argue that being excluded from the magial community is a way, way harder punishmend then half a year in Azkaban, regardless of how bad being in Azkaban is. Karkaroff got his life back after he got released and had another chance at living in the magical community while people like Hagrid who got expelled never get a second chance and can only live in the magical community with many restrictions, if at all. The whole expelling kids from school and thereby banning them for life is stupid anyway but for the love of god, I will not understand why there would be any case in which torturing muggles should be punished a lot more leniently then doing underage magic.",books,1827

"Is 12 rules for life by Jordan Peterson an easy to read book?

"A lot of people were criticizing the book for its hebephilic material but it was bearable and her relation with her symbionts is adorable aside from that, the storytelling was excellent as expected from Butler, both character design (and narrative concept are A1. Also, the chemistry and interaction between the cast are particularly organic and well thought out and the narrative has a deeper social commentary regarding race relations. What is there not to like?

I am not saying though that this is her best work, I would place each Parable as well as Kindred and the Lilith Brood series over it. I mean that it is better than a lot of fantasies stand-alone, especially from the same era.",books,691
"The book club that I just started wanted to read this book as our first book and truthfully, I just really do not. Firstly, I am trying to just get away from the toxicity of politics and just enjoy an escape into reading, despite that, I would say from this group of friends I follow politics the most. As an example, there were multiple times last year when I would talk to them about the primaries usually after the debates or a big primary and the different platforms of the democratic candidates and they would just be glossed over and I kid you not would just transition over to ""The Bachelor"" so much so it felt like they did not watch any of the debates (including the girl who recommended this book). There is nothing wrong with that I guess so I stopped talking about politics around them.

 Secondly, I feel like it probably is just going to be propaganda for the left (and after seeing reviews that say that they could not find a fault with her or Barack- that seems more and more likely). 90% of the reviews seem to say ""I used to love her but now I love her soo much more"". I looked at the good reads reviews and it has a 4.5+ rating, which is an insanely high rating when The Autobiography of Malcolm X has a 4.3 rating- that is not right. I say this as someone who supported/voted for Obama in 2008 and 2012, and a person of color.

It seems like we are going to have to read this book and I will bite the bullet on this. I hope to be pleasantly surprised and hope I am wrong about the conceptions held above, but I am curious to see what you guys think of this book.",books,1582
"To me writing style/structure is more important than what the characters saying or doing. Once you figure out for example how the author describes things or the way the author tells you key details then it changes your whole perception of a book.

Take GGM, he does something not many writers can pull off, he gives you major plot points ahead of time/key information early on without build up to it. Take Chronicle of a Death Foretold, on the first page he tells us Santiago will be killed, very early on he tells us who committed the murder....basically the opposite of a who-dunnit, but he still keeps you hooked with jumps forwards and backwards in time. To some this may be very disjointed but like a who-dunnit novel (whereby the detective uncovers information bit by bit and in the end you get the big ta-da reveal of the killer) GGM like the detective in those novels gives you the information but he does so sometimes jumping forward in time and sometimes backwards.

Even in his most famous work 100 Years of Solitude he starts with 'many years later as he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buendia...' so already you have something major that happens to the character at the end of his life told within the first sentence. I did see a post on reddit from my browsing someone saying they disliked GGM telling you the information (they felt somewhat cheated of the climax to the moment) but i think this style is key to how GGM wants to structure his narrative. For example in Chronicle of Death Foretold he tells you the reader that Santiago will be killed, the story goes on and we uncover that many other characters knew he was gonna be killed so it puts you the reader with the other characters and isolates Santiago even more. 

Do you guys focus much on structure? Or not so much because I don't see many people focus much on structure unless someone does something very unique or obvious",books,1911
"Hello all,

I wanted to read the original story of King Arthur, his knights and the Holy Grail so I tried to find it online. According to my very quick research, it seems like there is a million books about the legend of King Arthur. I was wondering if there is an ""original"" book, or it is basically a legend with multiple interpretations and thus there is not really a single, original book. 

If anyone here is more familiar with the stories, I would love a recommedation on which edition from which author to read first. I am not really interested in reading anything in old/middle English, so I guess that a modern adaptation would be best - but which one?",books,661

However, the amount was deducted from my account (I checked with the bank and my banking app). This is despite the email from Abebooks, who specified, no amount will be deducted.

"There are two books from my childhood I desperately want to share with my children (and students) while they are still children which are inexcusably out of print.  The most important of these is ""Archelon and the Sea Dragon"" by  Frances K. Pavel and Jim Lamb from Childrens Press, 1975.  This one was so good that I always thought that I would need to read it to any children I might have in the future and expected great books to remain in print.  Apparently, this book was only ever printed once, and there are currently NO copies available from any online sellers.  There was a copy available from an Amazon seller last year for $36 which I was considering for a time when I was not so poor, but that copy is now gone.

The other book which I just discovered is long out of print is called ""The Terrible Trick or Treat"" by Edith Battles from Young Scott Books, 1970.  The only copies I can find online are in fair condition (i.e., beaten nearly to death) price at $35 AND $34 but with price gouging on international shipping nearly doubling that cost.  The fact that there are no ebook editions makes no sense, either.  I would absolutely love to have pdf copies.  I should also mention that there is probably not one single library copy of either of these books anywhere on my side of the planet (eastern hemisphere), either.

I will also mention with a little shame that I have even tried some dubious websites looking for ebook editions with no luck.",books,1457
"I commute for 2 hours a day. Ebooks are a blessing. I bought ""Best of Lovecraft"" as I have read a lot of positive things. I read/heard the Lovecraft Frankenstein story, the Rat and witch in the room under the roof-story. The silver stuff in the valley and glass maze on another planet-stories. And the thing is - I'm not impressed... Sure he had a great imagination, but I just don't think it's well written. In the story about the dude that switchers body with an alien, he rambles on about species and tribes on what has to be several pages, things that are just not that relevant to the storyline.

"Hey guys, 

I have been trying to find similar posts here but they always include information what ends up being useless. I have been trying to find a proper e-store where they sell used language books. All the posts what have similar topics, always recommend only UK or US based e-stores what are useless for me. 

I do not want to pay huge shipping cost + taxes if I order from US and most UK based bookstores do not ship outside of UK or all of their prices are in pounds what make everything 10x harder for me to understand since I have to use currency calculator.

Only website I know what sells language books is [awesomebooks.com](https://awesomebooks.com) but I did not find a lot of language books there and hoping for you guys to help me find more. This website ships to all EU countries, has very good shipping cost and has proper currency already ready for you based on your location.

I am based in Estonia and would like a store what offers EU shipping (reasonable price not 20EUR for shipping) and preferably used book store.

Unfortunately I can not afford new books around 15-30 EUR.

Thank you so much in advance!",books,1131

"Hello all, I hope you enjoyed the pun. üòÅ

I'm trying to get myself into reading a little more. I'm 23. I'm really bad at reading and paying attention in general. The words are not an issue, the issue lies in the meaning behind those written words. This is due to the fact that I have not read many books, but I'm changing that starting today! 

The goal of this journey is to have a more in-depth understanding and appreciation authors try to convey in their literature, as well as the ability to discuss these insights with fellow peers! Additionally, I would like to increase my attention span as it is minimal at best!

My book list (Thus far):

The Alchemist (Paulo Coehlo)
Demonata series (10 books, Darren Shan)
Of mice and men
The lion the witch and the wardrobe (C.S. Lewis)
Harry Potter, PS and CoS (J.K. Rowling)
Witch and Wizard (James Patterson) 
The gift (James Patterson)
(Various children's books when I was little lol)

Plays that I have read:
A view from the bridge (Arthur Miller)
Pool no water (Mark Raven hill)
4:48 Psychosis (Sarah Kane)

As you can see, there are some really interesting pieces of literature here. My favourite book so far being ""The Alchemist""!

I had really resonated with the story, as it is about a young boy, Santiago, searching the world to realise and fulfill his dream.

I am currently reading ""The Underground Railroad"". I am finding it a little challenging. The writing style is not what I am used to, but repeatedly reading the same pages to make sure I understand really helps!

I also have a tendency to ""zone out""... So hopefully, this will be the start of an exciting and educational new journey! ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Please feel free to recommend some books for me to read! I am open to lots of different genres! 

My reading list so far for this month is as follows:
- The Underground Railroad (Colson Whitehead)
- Misery (Stephen King)

Also please excuse my writing style, grammatical and spelling errors! üòÇ",books,1948

"I longed to find out when Eric Newby would run into Wilfred Thesiger during ""A Short Walk in the Hindu Kush,"" Newby's tongue-in-cheek, observational travelogue of his journey through Nuristan in Northeastern Afghanistan in 1957ish. Apparently, Newby and his traveling companion Hugh Carliss ran into the famed explorer and Arab loyalist during there ill-planned trek through these inaccessible mountains. When you finally get to it, it's two short pages of dialogue and observation of Thesiger, who I had never read about before. He's depicted as kind of an eccentric traveling charlatan, who calls Newby and Carliss ""pansies."" I chuckled and then felt slightly disappointed that this apparently famed explorer, who walked through the Empty Quarter in disguise for five years, was so churlish. 

But woe is me. And surprises abound. I turned open the pages of ""Arabian Sands,"" Thesiger's account of his tramp through the Empty Quarter and I find a much different man, and a much more loyalist and abiding character than the one in Newby's book. I mark this down to Newby apparently being something of a jokester and a wit, and maybe that he had to keep the ruse going in ""Hindu Kush"" of being the rather feckless and bumbling wannabe explorer who was a little out of his depth.

Thesiger is anything but a dog-paddling ne'er do well in up over his head. Thesiger's approach to the travelogue is to really do three things well that Newby tries to do but can't really mark down: 

1. Understand the ""way of life"" of the people and why they live that way
2. Focus on the personalities and the stories that come from the people themselves, rather than his own personality and his own drama 
3. Understated historical accounts of the true nature of the ""place"" without getting lost in the details of archeology, or architecture (I mean, what buildings are there in a desert, true), and politics and government. 

Where Newby spends pages and pages in British administrator historical narratives of details that do not at all link to the action on the soil, Thesiger takes us into the hearts and minds of the men he chose as his traveling companions (at great personal risk to himself and they, who left their families behind and had no way of making any money through trade or cultivation during the five years they traveled). 

In the end, I am not too sure why Newby gets so many accolades for being one of the greatest travel writers, for, in my opinion, he wastes a lot of time displaying his writing talent, and loses the thread of the true human stories of those he encounters. Though Thesiger was not an expert in the Arabic language, at least he seemed to know enough to investigate and account for the minds therein. I applaud him for that, and think that his travel writing style is the better one.",books,2803
"I was going through some of the book recommendations in this subreddit and found myself intrigued by 'A little life'. After almost a year of contemplation I bought it and started reading it.

"My favorite thing about them was just Hilton's writing style. I can't pinpoint exactly what it is about his writing but it's so easy to read and feels really modern even though these were written 80-90 years ago. And I liked the dialogue that he writes as well; I wasn't surprised to learn that he got in to screenwriting (he has a writing credit on the 1942 best picture winner Mrs. Miniver). The conversations between characters flow so naturally.

Lost memories seemed to be a common theme in his writing. I especially liked how Random Harvest is structured where the reader pieces things together along with the narrator.

Mr. Chips is a super short story, Lost Horizon is pretty short as well (I read it in 3 sittings) and then Random Harvest was a little longer and probably my favorite of the three.

Has anybody else read any of his other works? I started with these three as they seem to be his most read by far, but if his others are worth reading I'd love to check them out!",books,985
"Yes. I came back begging for more, even though I complained so much about the first book in the series (‚ÄúLittle Women‚Äù). What can I say? I like to finish what I‚Äôve started. 

Jumping straight in, I didn‚Äôt like ‚ÄúLittle Men‚Äù at all (even less than ‚ÄúLittle Women‚Äù), but I DID appreciate that it was WAY easier to read than its predecessor. 

This book definitely felt like it was written for little kids. I know that ‚ÄúLittle Women‚Äù is supposed to be a YA novel, but it felt more adult than this one. Sitting at 400 pages (just like the first one), ‚ÄúLittle Men‚Äù took me way less time to read. I guess the main reason for that is that it was definitely written in a child-friendly way. 

&gt;! I guess the only exception is John Brooke‚Äôs death, though even that was written in a very child-friendly way. !&lt;

Just like with the first one, the characters were very bland. Every boy had one specific character trait that dominated his personality, turning him into a sort of a ‚Äúpower ranger‚Äù or ‚Äúcare bear‚Äù. Nat is the ‚Äúangelic one‚Äù; Demi is the smart one; Daisy is the wifely one; Tom is the troublemaker... You get the gist. 

The only character that was even remotely interesting was Dan. Starting out as a troublemaker and a bit of a bad influence on the rest of the boys, he rises to the rank of one of Jo‚Äôs favorite and most devoted ‚Äúboys‚Äù. 

As with every book series, what interests us the most is the reoccurring characters and the way they developed over time. 

Even though this is a sequel to ‚ÄúLittle Women‚Äù, the characters from that book actually barely appear in this one. Of course, you have Jo, who is pretty prominent, though nowhere near the de facto main character that she was in the first book; you have Professor Bhaer, who‚Äôs presence in this book takes up even less time than his presence in the first book; and, of course, the eternally present Laurie (for he‚Äôs eternally following his ‚ÄúBFF‚Äù Jo). All the rest of the characters are either only mentioned in passing, or only appear at the end of the book.

These characters have changed IMMENSELY since we left them off in ‚ÄúLittle Women‚Äù. Jo has stopped writing, instead choosing to become a copy of her mother (Marmee) from the first book. Full of wisdom and motherly love, she completely denounces her personality from the first book, calling her younger self ‚Äúnaughty and a huge burden on the family‚Äù. As for writing, it‚Äôs almost as if she never head the aspirations she was incessantly harping on in ‚ÄúLittle Women‚Äù. 

Friedrich Bhaer has become the new Mr. March- almost completely absent, only appearing sometimes to spread wisdom across the land. The hot romance that he had with Jo at the end of the first book is now completely missing. It‚Äôs kind of like the two are more work partners than husband and wife. Then again, Fritz is absent 90% of the time, so I guess it makes sense that they aren‚Äôt really close.

Laurie has changed almost completely. His Christian Bale-like toughness and rebelliousness that I actually kind of liked in the first book is now completely gone, exchanged with a millionaire‚Äôs nonchalant personality. Because he is so boring now, I will only say one more thing. THE LOVE HIM AND JO HAVE FOR ONE ANOTHER IS ALMOST MORE TRANSPARENT THAN IN THE FIRST BOOK! The way they talk to each other; the way they touch each other... It‚Äôs almost a miracle that the Professor hasn‚Äôt beaten him yet! 

As for everything else, there isn‚Äôt much to write about. The book is written in a series of short stories kind of way, with each chapter involving the misadventures of one of the boys from Jo‚Äôs school. I‚Äôm not going to say that every single anecdote was terribly boring- it wasn‚Äôt. A couple of stories that come to mind are &lt;spoiler&gt; Demi‚Äôs sacrificial pyre; Nat being accused of stealing Tommy‚Äôs money; everything involving Dan &lt;/spoiler&gt;

Lastly, I will rate the book. 5 categories, 1-5 stars for each category. Averaging out all 5 ratings will give me the final rating.

1. Writing (how well I liked the writing style/ how easy was it for me to read the book) 2 stars. Though I still didn‚Äôt like the writing, I will give Alcott an extra star just for the fact that the language was much easier to read than in the first book.

2. Themes (how well the themes were developed/ did they come through well/did I agree with them) This book was even preacher than the first one. It was clear that this book was written for a much younger audience than the first one- or the author just thought that she should dumb- down this book because it was to be read by boys, as opposed to girls... I will give the themes 1 star, simply because I really hated that Alcott denounced any activity that wasn‚Äôt charity, giving to others, or self-denial. 

3. Characters (how well were the characters written) Though very bland, there were a few characters I was invested in, so I‚Äôm giving it 3 stars here. (Thank Dan, Alcott)

4. Plot (was the plot interesting; was I invested) The plot of the book was kind of boring. It‚Äôs as if Alcott spent more time and effort on the morals and themes, rather than the story. 2 stars.

5. Emotion (I am a pretty emotional person, every book makes me feel something) I would‚Äôve quickly dismissed this section with 1 Star, but &gt;! Dan‚Äôs story arch and John Brooke‚Äôs death DID add SOME spice to this otherwise bland book !&lt; add an additional star. 3 stars. 

Average: 2.2 Stars",books,5401

"This book received harsh criticism, some of which was just for the title and by people who said themselves they haven't even read it, saying it is transphobic. I presume it's because of the wrong pronouns being used for a transgender person (in this case, a person born male but identifying themselves as female is being referred to as a brother rather than a sister). 

I myself am not convinced and would like to dig into it and figure out what I think about it myself (as a cis, I might add) for the simple reason that I believe there isn't any book which should be instantly dismissed because it would be like dismissing a person's opinion as soon as they open their mouth. Each book tells the story of a unique individual (and I'm talking about the author, not the narrator) with their own beliefs and experiences, and no matter how backwards you think those beliefs are, they are still worthy of being understood. Books are not merely there to explain and educate, but also to let the reader become aware of different ways of thinking and in that way, instil empathy and sensitivity towards others.

"Brutal is the first word that comes to mind. Fantastical characters such as shape-shifters, witches, vampires, giants and demons all of who murder, rape and ravage indiscriminately are the driving force behind this action-adventure story. James fantasy world stems from African history, myth and folklore as opposed to the traditional European tropes of the genre. The narrative jumps around in time and moves lightening fast, which can make it a bit confusing at times, but keeps it a thrilling read. Even at a hefty 600+ pages, it never slows down because it is packed with so much action while deeply exploring the lore of his world. It's post-modern style and themes also provide some intellectual challenges beyond the epic tale, such as exploring the nature of truth. The appeal of this book reaches beyond genre and has a lot to offer many different types of readers, but don't pick it up if your just looking for a light beach read. 

Bonus: Michael B. Jordan has purchased the rights to adapt this book. It is rumored that this will be part one of a Rashomon-style trilogy in which each book is the same story told from a different perspective. There is a lot of talk about how this book is, and its adaptation has the potential to be, an ""African Game of Thrones."" Although there are similarities to be found between the two and I believe that fans of one will become fans of the other, I think this is a simplistic comparison that does not give justice to the originality of BLRW.",books,1491
"In 2005, **Cormac McCarthy** wrote a novel ‚Äú*No Country for Old Men*‚Äù. Two years later, the **Coen brothers** made the movie. The distinction between the novel and the movie, at least in terms of presented ideas, seems to be small enough to allow us to consider them as one thing. The title itself already hints at a story of an old generation struggling to keep its place in the new world. Too big and too old of a question. What context was given here? How sheriff *Ed Tom Bell*‚Äôs (**Tommy Lee Jones**) tragedy is different from those of the previous generations of people? The sheriff is pretty certain those differences exist.

In his first monologue *Bell* tells the story of a boy sentenced to a gas chamber for murder. The boy admits that he had been planning to kill somebody for as long as he could remember and ready to go to hell. In the book, *Bell* wonders whether men like this one ever existed before. In the movie, he then turns to *Anton Chigurh* (**Javier Bardem**) and the crime he was about to commit. *Chigurh* features not only extreme audacity, elusiveness and seeming immortality ‚Äî no one even knows how he looks. In a later scene *Bell* would call him a ghost, although totally admiting his reality. Having zero knowledge about who *Chigurh* is, where does he come from, he feels an unprecedented evil, threatening not only physical existence of humans but rather their souls. He says, ‚Äú‚Ä¶More than that, I don‚Äôt want to know. A man would have to put his soul at hazard. He would have to say, okay, I‚Äôll be part of this world.‚Äù Because of the fright for his soul *Bell* is not ready to accept the new world, he is not ready to fight it. The sheriff shows no sign of physical trauma, or even exhaustion, but still quits the job.

*Bell* and his uncle *Ellis* share the same blood and the same profession, but their views and situations seem to be opposite. *Ellis* is confined to a chair, half blind, isolated from the world and almost forgotten by it. Nevertheless, his spirit is obviously strong. He says that \*Bell‚Äô\*s position is nothing new, that the evil *Ed Tom* sees has always been here, and people only failed to react. ‚ÄúThis country was hard on people. But they never seemed to hold it to account.‚Äù To support his words, *Ellis* tells the story of uncle *Mac* killed by some rogues in 1909. However, by the end of the dialogue *Bell* still believes in the uniqueness of his troubles. Looking at this, *Ellis* concludes, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs vanity.‚Äù

\*Bell‚Äô\*s disgust towards the contemporary world goes along with an idealizing of the old one. He says, ‚ÄúI always liked to hear about the oldtimers. Never missed a chance to do so.‚Äù Another example of utter reverance and admiration ‚Äî his second dream about the father. Finally, in the book we see one of the causes of his mental sufferings ‚Äî during World War II, *Bell* once left his wounded comrades to die on the battlefield, got a medal in spite of it and could never forgive himself ever since. Although it wasn‚Äôt a sheer cowardice, rather a ‚Äúrun or die‚Äù scenario, he is assured that his father, being a better man, would have never ‚Äúrun‚Äù. To this, *Ellis* shows readiness to expose *Bell*‚Äôs father in a much darker light. Thus we arrive to some questions.

&gt;*Why do these two close men, Bell and Ellis, disagree in their views on current generational turnover? How their own generations are different?*

As it appears to me, a very good start for searching the answer is to notice that two things in this artwork, namely newspapers and TV, occupy disproportionally large space. You find them here too often to ignore. It is completely natural to see a TV set in a motel room or in *Moss‚Äô (****Josh Brolin****)* trailer, or to watch *Bell* reading a paper during breakfast. But this is not quite all. *Bell* twice re-tells stories from newspapers during the movie. The nature of them and the accents given are important. In what way the newspaper presented to the public a murder of a 14-year-old girl by a 19-year-old boy told at the very beginning? As a ‚Äúcrime of passion‚Äù. In effect, the newspaper had almost justified a maniac and a relationship between a guy of his age and a teenage girl. In another example we hear about a couple, who rented a house to old people. They were burying victims right in the backyard. They tortured them. They were stealing their money. *Bell* reacts to torturing, ‚ÄúMaybe their television set was broke.‚Äù Then he quotes the newspaper, ‚ÄúNeighbors were alerted when a man ran from the premises wearing only a dog collar,‚Äù and comments, ‚ÄúBut that‚Äôs what it took, you‚Äôll notice. Get someone‚Äôs attention. Diggin graves in the back yard didn‚Äôt bring any.‚Äù The last sentence made *Wendell*, his young partner, giggle. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs all right. I laugh myself sometimes. There ain‚Äôt a whole lot else you can do,‚Äù *Bell* replied. How could we translate this? The television and the newspapers provide the public with tons of content built around cruelty and violence. And they tend to bring an entertaining side to it. By placing the story under specific angle and light they search for scandal, provocation and intrigue. If it lacks neccessary elements they sometimes invent them. Only two such stories made way into the movie, but the book contains a lot more. In a 150-page book we meet with the word ‚Äúnewspaper‚Äù and its derivatives more than 40 times.

What about TV? The most important scene, I presume, is the one in *Moss*‚Äô trailer where a merciless killer *Chigurh* sits on a sofa with a carton of milk in his hand watching his own reflection on the TV screen.

This scene is too strange to not to bear a specific meaning. It must have a non-trivial explanation. Especially since it almost repeats again, a couple minutes later, with sheriff *Bell* in place of *Chigurh.*

Take notice how bewildered *Chigurh* is when he takes a seat and looks at himself. Like he was asking, ‚ÄúWho am I? What am I doing?‚Äù Look at his eyes staring at the screen. These are of a person who dived deeply into his consciousness, in his memories. In an attempt to find an interpretation, let‚Äôs imagine that a many years ago a small boy *Anton Chigurh* in the same manner sat on a sofa drinking milk and watched TV for hours, watched exciting movies and TV series, cartoons and news reports. Then imagine, since it is rather easy, that no one was explaining to him properly all the cruelty and violence he saw. Everything shown by a glowing screen reflects, one way or other, in the viewer, forms his personality. The moment this very screen turns off we see the opposite ‚Äî the viewer‚Äôs reflection on it. In case of *Chigurh,* reflection looks dark and gloomy, light shines only somewhere outside, in the window. And we know how dark his soul is.

Now, look at the ‚Äúcopy‚Äù of that scene, the one which depicts *Bell*. His reflection on the screen is considerably lighter. You can see the shape, the posture, and the signature hat shining like an aureole.

Moreover, at the right side of the image we see *Bell*‚Äôs shadow looming over the screen. The shadow proves that unlike *Chigurh,* whose personality drowned completely inside the world of television, *Bell* stays outside. To some extent, he sees the influence and controls it. At the end of the scene *Wendell* asks *Bell*, ‚ÄúYou think this boy *Moss* has got any notion of the sorts of sons of bitches that are huntin‚Äô him?‚Äù Sheriff replies, ‚ÄúHe ought to. He seen the same things I seen and it made an impression on me.‚Äù Suppose, he refers to the scenery of gunfight in the desert. It is possible for *Moss* to get impressed by it, even with his experience of the Vietnam war taken in consideration, but I surely find it hard to believe that *Bell* himself, long-serving sheriff, saw there something new. Have you seen any sign of any impression on his face during the course of the movie? I think I have not. Therefore, I suggest to pay attention to this: while saying those words *Bell* looks directly at the TV screen. We hear the words ‚Äúhe seen the same things I seen‚Äù right at the moment when the close-up with *Bell*‚Äôs reflection on the screen appears. Even if he was formally responding to *Wendell*‚Äôs question, his real thoughts could have been different ‚Äî concerned with the things he has seen on that screen in all these years. *Moss* saw the same things. Millions of others too. And surely everyone was impressed.

&gt;*These two scenes give a visual representation of how television influences people. One reflects in another.*

Recall the scene in motel with *Chigurh* fixing his wounds. The book tells us about a five days he needed to recover, and almost all this time he spent in front of a TV. Nothing suspicious, you could say. Only **McCarthy** notes that the wounded villain never switched channels. ‚ÄúHe watched whatever came on. He watched soap operas and the news and talk shows.‚Äù It is a behaviour of a mesmerized. In the movie this scene looks different, we do not hear about ‚Äúfive days of laying in bed‚Äù, but nearly the whole process of *Chigurh‚Äôs medical manipulations proceeds with a TV turned on. Anton shuts it off, in a rather unconcious, mechanical way, just before he finally sits on his bed and relieves himself with the final drug injection. Chigurh represents evil,* and we see how a television accompany its healing. Meaning, television gives strength to evil. Such interpretation can be considered fanciful, but not if we see a direct connection with other scenes and a strong compliance with some general idea existing throughout the movie.

&gt;*For what reason in the artwork dealing with themes of violence and gore so much attention given to newspapers and TV?*

Frequent experiencing of the same feeling makes it grow dull. If you see violence and cruelty everyday, especially in a romanticized form, and from a safe distance, then it would not be so difficult to lose any sense of them, to become devoid of compassion. When covered with blood, exhausted *Moss* met three young men on his way to the Mexican border, their only question was ‚Äúwere you in a car accident?‚Äù We see not a bit of compassion, not a slightest desire to help. In the book, they went by without paying much attention to *Moss*. He was forced to call out to them.

In the car crash scene, that left *Chigurh* with a broken arm, boys act very differently. They are shocked by the sight and willing to contribute help. They just know too little about acting under such circumstances. However, the very moment the villain makes them accept the money a conflict arises between them. The thing is that the boy who gave his shirt to *Chigurh* has an appearence suspiciously similar to the one who sold a jacket to *Moss*. Look at their faces, these two could be the same man, just a few years apart. It must be intentional. The question about car crash given to *Moss* and an actual car crash *Chigurh* was in together make another clear link between this two scenes. Their goal probably was to show the genesis of corruption and the behavioural changes it leads to.

At first glance, these two scenes have nothing to do with TV and papers ‚Äî money is the issue. In the movie, soon after *Moss* being murdered, local sheriff, the one with a grey moustache, tells \*Bell, ‚Äú\*It‚Äôs all the goddamned money. The money and the drugs.‚Äù Only he forgets that money has been there for hundreds of years, and thus it cannot explain ‚Äúkids with green hair and bones in their noses‚Äù emerging on the streets. Speaking of drugs, **McCarthy** indicates the importance of the existence not only of sellers but of buyers too. Someone must place an idea of buying in person's head first.

&gt;*Both, money and drugs, are easily explained with the influence of popular culture, which built a cult around them.*

A random worker from the nineteenth century had no idea of what ‚Äúa lot of money‚Äù is. He never saw anything beyond his own, very limited life. Now, with a push of the button he saw, at his own level of perception, what a million dollars could serve for, what a man could do in order to get it, how could it change human life. Television brought a concept of million dollars to ordinary man‚Äôs feet. But only the concept. Only an illusion of its existence in his life. In case of *Moss* and his family, only death became real. Note that his downfall was partially caused by the receiver hidden inside the satchel. What could notions of signal ‚Äúreceiver‚Äù and ‚Äútransponder‚Äù refer to? Moreover, television can be easily compared to a bunch of money found laying in a desert. It is relatively cheap, almost to a point to look like a gift, like a blessing. Huge amount of pleasure inside. But what is the price? What else is here?

For some ‚Äúmysterious‚Äù reason, **McCarthy** mentioned in his book that *Ellis* threw his TV away, and *Loretta*, *Bell*‚Äôs wife, stopped reading papers. ‚ÄúAccidentally‚Äù, they seem to be the only characters with no given evidence of mental trauma or disorder of any kind. People were getting hurt psychologically before the invention of television too. Maybe even more. But such troubles always took origin in their real life experience, in a more explicit way. Here, in this virtual world they were far from seeing all the influence they were embracing. When *Bell* hears from *Ellis* the story of uncle *Mac*‚Äôs murder, which is a part of his family history, he admits that he hears it for the first time. Reasonable men always protected people they care about from stories of this kind. Modern newspapers and TV often decide not to confine themselves in such fashion.

Events of the book, and the movie, occur in 1980. The TV industry started developing in 1940s, thus, by 1980 the world got its first generations of grown up people whose whole life went in the age of television. At the same time, the last generation of those who grew up without seeing a single TV broadcast was still alive. It was the point of ultimate contrast. Of the brightest, or the grimmest, contrast. Newspapers existed long before that time, but their contents changed along with the rise of popular culture. As a result of this rise, not only people became more cold, heartless and less empathic, but their ability to determine what is good and what is bad, what is important and what is not, drastically weakened.

&gt;*People simply look the wrong way. Their eye catches ‚Äúa naked wearing only a dog collar‚Äù, but fails to see the suffering neighbor.*

When *Bell* and *Wendell* came to the crime scene in the desert, *Wendell* instantly noticed, from a distance, that someone took the inspection plate off the door. Such power of observation may look impressive, but what exactly it contributes to here? It has no use for the investigation whatsoever. Yet, a couple scenes later, *Wendell* knocks on the door of *Moss*‚Äô trailer and does not see a huge hole in it left by *Chigurh.* He does not see an utterly important and evident thing standing right in front of him.

You cannot discuss the old without discussing the young. You cannot explain one thing without the other. **Cormac McCarthy** concentrated himself on the old. To balance it, the **Coen brothers** amplified the young characters to the point of being extremes too.

Look at *Wendell*, he is shown not just stupid ‚Äî he is childishly stupid. His interaction with *Bell* looks like an interaction between a grown-up and a child. And this particular grown-up has already lost faith in the child and sees his every action, hears his every word with pain. Who would be asking why didn‚Äôt coyotes eat the bodies? Who would go exclaiming ‚ÄúWhoa! Sheriff! Sheriff, we just missed him!‚Äù? Who would joke at a crime scene, in front of an enflamed car, about frying wieners? Looking at this car, *Bell* tells his version of supposed \*Chigurh‚Äô\*s chain of actions. *Wendell* calls it ‚Äútoo linear‚Äù. Isn‚Äôt the word ‚Äúlinear‚Äù often being used to describe plots in movies and books? Anyway, he is more of a comical figure. If a man has to grow up on second-rate movies and TV series he could easily become like *Wendell*. Actor‚Äôs job here was to play not a policeman, but rather a man who ‚Äúplays‚Äù a policeman in his real life.

*Llewelyn Moss* may look like a good guy, but does he really discern good and bad? His return to the dying of thirst Mexican does not appear to be an act of mercy. More like a blind imitation. His pretentious admittance of stupidity of this decision may fit good to a soap opera hero, only what we see here is a much more serious work, filled with dramatic events and important ideas. Its characters should look natural and real. What person when going towards death, and admitting it, would be joking about his dead mother? Like *Wendell, Moss* is natural only as someone who imitates movie heroes, throws a movie line in the moment of truth. He showed no sign of compassion when saw that Mexican in agony and pain right in front of eyes. *Moss* refused him in a plead to finish the sufferings (to save from *lobos*). Also\*,\* he completely ignored his dying of cancer mother-in-law. He fleed from his wife when the mess began, though justified it with her own security. Finally, he rejected *Chigurh*‚Äôs deal that could have saved her. Television made *Chigurh* cruel and heartless, but to *Moss* it gave a too shallow and false notion of virtue. He truly knows only those simple practical things he learned in Vietnam.

What about *Carson Wells* **(Woody Harrelson)**? Isn‚Äôt he a movie hero? Again, what I mean is what his role is about. Do not confuse it with him literally being a character in a movie. His looks and manners are too fancy. His self-assurance is repulsive, his resounding jokes are stupid. He was very successful, but only to a certain point at which his spirit and character vanished. *Chigurh,* who rarely shows emotions, openly smiles at *Wells* for his transformation. He did not expect to see that nervous, sweating, blushful face and a pitiful attempt to buy the life with a 14k from an ATM (remember earlier that day *Wells* told *Moss* about *Chigurh*‚Äôs contempt towards money). Key question *Chigurh* asks is ‚Äúif the rule you followed brought you to this, of what use was the rule?‚Äù It translates to ‚Äúwhat was the point in all that coolness and fancy if at the toughest moment you descend to such a misery?‚Äù Colorful image had no strong spirit behind it.

*Wendell*, *Moss* and *Wells* in comparison with *Bell* and *Ellis* look like teenagers who can only imitate grown people. Surprisingly though, the biggest child is *Chigurh*. First thing to notice is that mentioned scene with milk. Second, look at his ridiculous haircut ‚Äî such disasters usually occur to small kids, victims of their parents‚Äô incompetence in the tricky question of style. Look at how he talks, at how he walks, at how he holds hands straight during walk. He reminds of an elementary school pupil. How does he look when he kills the driver on the road with his air gun? Maybe like a curious child who experiments with an unknown thing? This air gun is a personal toy he takes everywhere. A very strange and unique one. He found a special use to it, to shoot locks off doors, and does so anywhere he can.

Why did *Chigurh* kill those two men in the desert? Maybe he was upset with their suggestion to ‚Äúride bitch‚Äù? Middle seat of a car is a typical place for a small kid. But everyone wants to ‚Äúride shotgun‚Äù. Already traumatized child could have received another psychological problem concerned with a middle seat. When the kid grew up into a maniac, the price for an accidental reminding of it was human life. It may be far-fetched, but if the answer is different then what is it? What were those rather pointless words for? Why did he killed? \*Chigurh‚Äô\*s actions are defined by principles, not chaos. A principle to kill everyone you see is not among them.

The woman from the trailer park spoke to *Anton* like a wicked teacher to a small kid. Pay attention to her glance, the tone of her voice, the fact that she is sitting at the desk and holding her nail file like a pen. Then look at \*Chigurh‚Äô\*s face and voice. What does he say to her? He repeats the same line three times in a row, ‚ÄúWhere does he work?‚Äù This is how a bewildered, frightened kid would react in face of something unknown and hostile. He gets no answer to his question and can only feverishly repeat it again. The maniac living inside knows the solution, but a toilet flush sound unexpectedly makes him go. A school bathroom can become a scary place for a kid. The most violent things in his life could happen here. Anyway, while watching this scene just imagine her to be a teacher and *Chigurh* to be a child, and you‚Äôll see ‚Äî every thing fits here.

However, the strongest proof of a small boy‚Äôs presence somewhere inside this psychopath is the scene of *Carla Jean*‚Äôs murder. Here we see tears in \*Chigurh‚Äô\*s eyes. What caused them? What could have come to his mind here in a neat bedroom in a small house while sitting in a comfy armchair in front of a young woman? Could have he remembered his mother, remembered himself at the age of, say, eight years old? Could have he recalled all the sufferings of that time, and of the time to follow. Could have he recalled a moment of happiness, maybe the last one of his life? He could have. If he did, then no wonder this small boy inside him began crying and tried to save her. Only the maniac side was too strong and *Carla Jean* didn‚Äôt want to be saved by luck. In the movie, her bitter end can be easily concluded from the look *Chigurh* gives to his shoes when leaving the house ‚Äî after killing *Wells* he carefully put his feet away from the blood spreading on the floor. Although in the book, her fate is revealed openly.

Therefore, since we see no ‚Äúgrown‚Äù men in this movie, except for *Bell* and *Ellis*, then instead of ‚Äú*No Country for Old Men*‚Äù you may call it ‚ÄúNo Country for Grown-up Men‚Äù. Popular culture, chiefly childish in its form and content, created generations of grown-up people, whose mentality for bigger part stayed childish if compared to the standards existed a hundred years ago. Moral principles degraded, entertainment is the primary goal. Of all the characters of the younger generation, *Chigurh,* the crazy maniac\*,\* is the only one who has principles. *Wells* says about him, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a peculiar man. You could even say that he has principles. Principles that transcend money or drugs or anything like that. He‚Äôs not like you. He‚Äôs not even like me.‚Äù In the modern world, having principles that transcend money and drugs is considered a peculiarity, if not a craziness.

To see the degree of moral degradation is pretty hard since the previous generations are almost forgotten. This is symbolized by *Ellis* and his oblivion. His house stands alone in the middle of the desert, his only company ‚Äî stray cats. The Eagle hotel is another example. Its interior refers to a period no later than the beginning of the 20th century. The walls are covered with paintings showing the Wild West. There is no one here besides the desk clerk. *Moss* asked him to give a call if someone checks-in. He got none. Finally, just as in *Ellis*‚Äô house we see a cat. The symbol must bear the same meaning across these two scenes, and senility and loneliness is the most obvious one. The hotel is empty and the world it belonged to is forgotten.

There is more to say about *Chigurh.* More than any other character, he can be seen as an embodiment of some entity. He is a walking death. But we need to narrow it down. What about his air gun? Don‚Äôt we, combining ‚Äúdeath‚Äù and ‚Äúair gun‚Äù, arrive to the word ‚Äúdeathblow‚Äù? And it describes perfectly what popular culture did to society. The strike was made, it‚Äôs deadly, and *Chigurh* is the walking manifestation. Talking to *Carla Jean*, *Bell* tells about a modern way of killing beeves: by a shot from an air gun to the brain. This is a very literal representation of a deathblow. ‚ÄúAnimal never knows what hit him‚Äù, says *Bell*. The driver killed with an air gun stood patiently till the last moment. \*Chigurh‚Äô\*s appearance alone is a good enough reason to panic. Here, he steps out of a police car, not wearing a proper uniform, and puts a tube to the man‚Äôs forehead. What else do you need to make one shudder? That man just fell asleep.

In the movie, there is not so much information to make sense out of the scene at the roadside store, where *Chigurh* puts an old man‚Äôs life against a coin. Since *Anton* despises money, it is reasonable for him to hate a man for an arranged marriage. A coin is money too. But only not for *Chigurh.* He uses coins to give way to chance and to unscrew bolts from ventilation grilles. In the book, the answer is written almost directly. People do not notice how common things influence their lives, up to deciding fate. People do not comprehend the real meaning behind these things and how they came into their lives. Moreover, they seem to never think about it. A coin is just a small piece of metal being used for exchanging goods. *Chigurh* and **McCarthy** ask that old man, ‚ÄúWhat could that be an instrument of?‚Äù TV is just a box displaying images, you could say.

The biggest difference between the book and the movie is in much more plain and open exposition of ideas in the first. The excessive openness of the book could be the reason why some of the original lines, even the whole characters and storylines, were cut from the **Coens**‚Äô work. In the movie, *Moss* hitchhiked to the Mexican border and his route was shortened to a half-minute screen time with a remark of how dangerous this activity is. In the book we see a whole chapter dedicated to it. *Moss* is the driver and the hitchhiker is a 15-year-old girl, running to California chasing her dream. There is no need to specify what kind of dream it is and to what industry it belongs. *Moss* tries to explain how erroneous this decision is, and how important it is to approach your every move with care. Unfortunately, these words apply to him too. Maybe that is why *Moss* tells them.

For a definitive convincement in importance of movies and TV in this artwork, take a notice of the drug store, where *Chigurh* stole his medications. Its name is ‚ÄúMike Zoss Pharmacy‚Äù. The **Coen brothers** have their own film production company called ‚ÄúMike Zoss Productions‚Äù. The legend says that they named the company after a real drug store, ‚ÄúMike Zoss Drugs‚Äù, where brothers actually worked in their youth. This could have been a sufficient explanation in this case. But only if to undestand nothing in art, or to think the **Coen brothers** to understand nothing. Reasonable author would never want to make a pointless reference having no ideological connection with his work. The paramount task for art is to perfect the inner world of the viewer, to cure his moral ugliness. Drug stores are meant to cure people too. Maybe **Joel and Ethan** gave their company such a name out of a desire to be healers for the masses (not a thing one should openly admit). If you combine this assumption with the suggested earlier idea of this movie, then such a choice of the name for the drug store in the movie would make sense. Inarguably, ‚Äú*No Country for Old Men*‚Äù can reveal important things to the reader/viewer, it can heal and teach him right. But only if he understands it right. If he sees here just an entertaining story of a cowboy with a bag of money and a maniac chasing him, then the evil would find there help instead. What opened way to the drug store for *Chigurh*? He blown up a car, everyone flung to it, thus leaving him the space and time to steal the medicine. He created a false target for everyone‚Äôs attention and entertainment and that saved him. This is what happens when you look the wrong way ‚Äî evil wins.

Now, let us get back to the main hero, *Ed Tom Bell,* and his personal tragedy. When he came again to the motel where *Moss* got killed, his every move was full of hesitation. *Chigurh* was right there, behind the door, yet *Bell* didn‚Äôt search the room properly. He gave up. He was too afraid for his soul. He knows he did wrong. He implied this when spoke about the God justly refusing to come into his life. The story about *Charlie Walser* and his accident during slaughtering beeves was meant to convince *Carla Jean* not to be so sure in *Moss* and his victory over pursuers. ‚ÄúEven in the contest between man and cow the issue is not certain‚Äù. Ironically, these are the exact words *Bell* should have said to himself, when, ‚Äúfeeling overmatched‚Äù, retired from his job.

The story beautifully ends with *Bell* talking about his two dreams about father. In the movie they happened in a single day, at the very end of the story. In the book, these two are the only dreams he had about the father since his death, meaning, they could have happened long before the events shown to us and therefore should not be explained with them. At least, \*\*Cormac McCarthy‚Äô\*\*s vision must be found through analyzing *Bell* and his nature.

*Bell* says that he barely remembers the first one, the one about losing money given by the father, and mentions it very reluctantly. If the obscurity of his memory is sincere, then the unwillingness to turn to the dream could be explained by unimportance of content. But how could it be unimportant, being one of only two such dreams about his beloved father in a decades? Maybe the real story behind this dream was painful enough to hinder the remembering of it. Yes, only *Bell* himself couldn‚Äôt have deep regrets about losing money. He is a protagonist of a movie where a strong contempt towards pursuing money is expressed, and to lose money shouldn‚Äôt mean anything to him. The father must have punished the boy for his recklessness, the boy learned his lesson and sees no point in further discussion, since he sees no point in worrying over money. *Moss,* running for his illusory million dollars, symbolizes all the futility of a commoner‚Äôs dream about getting big money. He would only waste his life.

&gt;*‚ÄúHuman life should not be about money‚Äù is one of the prime messages this artwork conveys and the first Bell‚Äôs dream should be understood in that way.*

The second dream *Bell* describes in a much more vivid and detailed way. The tale is about his father riding a horse through snowy mountains in a dark night keeping a burning torch in his hand. It demonstrates the admiration *Bell* had towards him. In his eyes his father was a man always fighting till the end. He was willing and ready to bear that small light he had to those who needed it, to where darkness and cold reigned. To ride there, no matter what. Unlike his father, *Bell* gave up. The darkness and the cold scared him.

At last, I should try and guess the meaning behind the very last words of the book and the movie: ‚ÄúAnd then I woke up‚Äù. They don‚Äôt seem strange. Or do they? *Bell* was telling his dream and, obviously, was meant to wake up in the end of it. And that is exactly where the strangeness lies. Why would you tell something automatically implied by the very nature of your story? It is like to finish a telling about two people making a converstion with the words ‚Äúand then the conversation finished‚Äù. You must have a specific reason to make such a remark. In this case, you may notice that those words bring to an end not only the dream, but the whole book/movie as well. ‚Äú*No Country for Old Men*‚Äù is about moral degradation of society under the influence of popular culture. Not only about the fact itself and its causes, but also about the inability of people to see both. **McCarthy**, maybe because of his age, told his story in a rather open manner (the **Coen brothers** fixed it). He must have grew tired of people failing to see such apparent things. He must have grew tired of people failing to wake up, just like that driver who stood before *Chigurh* and his air tank.

&gt;*Maybe* **Cormac McCarthy** *hopes that the last words of his novel a man will read with a feeling that he finally woke up.*",books,31977
"a little bit if backstory:
 Before I begin, I am going to to through out that I am not a Christian by anymeans. 

 I was standing in the book aisle of Target, with a crisp twenty in my hands. I'm looking around for a new book, sadly, to no avail. That wad until I stumbled across 'Dream Big' by Bob Groff. On the surface it just looked like a self help book that centered around following your dreams. After opening the book up I (very) soon realize Bob Groff is a Christian author and the book seems to be a very Christian based book.

I was not excpecting this, and Im conflicted if I should even still read it. On one hand, I have a list of other books and I dont have intrest (or atleast I fear) in having Christian Self Help shoved down my throat. But on the other, it may not be all that bad and I did pay twenty dollars for it

"One of my favorite wind-downs during these quarantine-y times has been to get a little high, have a glass of wine and take a bubble bath. I also like to read in the bath, but I refuse to take in a new book, or one that can‚Äôt be easily replaced, because I‚Äôm a horrible klutz. Usually, this means a plain ‚Äúmass-market paperback,‚Äù the little ones they can be replaced for $10.00. 

My paperback of the moment is ‚ÄúGoing Postal,‚Äù and Pratchett was prescient, as usual. It‚Äôs funny, because Moist von Lipwig is a con man put in charge of a government offshoot‚Äîwhich has been a frequent complaint against sketchy presidencies, not just this one, for many years now‚Äîbut he turns out to be more of the Saul Goodman variety (innovative and wacky) than the Walter White variety (sociopathic and bonkers), so there‚Äôs that. But the part that really sticks out to me is the management of the Clacks (semaphore/telegraph towers). At the time he was writing, Pratchett would‚Äôve been referencing the questionable treatment of UPS/FedEx drivers, or their British equivalent. It reminded me of nothing as much as it reminded me of Amazon, however. Little care for workers‚Äô health or safety? Ruthless business practices? Reacher Gilt has a little more panache than Jeff Bezos, but the parallels are there. 

I also think it speaks to the cyclical nature of society. The citizens of Ankh-Morpork decided they were ‚Äúover‚Äù the Post Office when the Clacks popped up, and then the Clacks started to fail them, so they had a renewed interest in the Post Office. Nothing gold can stay (unless it‚Äôs Moist‚Äôs oft-mentioned wing√©d hat), and public opinion is variable. People love the convenience of Amazon today, but I think people will become nostalgic for shopping, human interaction, and tangible goods by the time the pandemic blows over, and retail will be reborn in a different form just like Moist‚Äôs Post Office is.

"53M and I‚Äôve set an intention to increase my reading after years of shallow internet-based ‚Äúscanning‚Äù.

I was something of a bookworm in my younger years, through to my early 20‚Äôs and have a recollection of reading being a vivid, imaginative experience.

I‚Äôve been reading a lot this year and enjoying it very much. I don‚Äôt need to force myself to read at all.

However I notice that my experience of reading, my ‚Äúimmersion‚Äù so to speak, feels somewhat limited and have a sense that it could be a bit richer.

I don‚Äôt know if this is related to how I read (maybe I‚Äôm reading too fast?) or it‚Äôs the price I‚Äôm paying for years of internet browsing or maybe even just my age.

I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs the authors I‚Äôm reading. Most of the books I read I can‚Äôt put down and I don‚Äôt feel I‚Äôm having to effort my way through them.

I‚Äôm curious if anyone has consciously sought to ‚Äúdeepen‚Äù their reading experience?",books,904
"I started the book ""Catch and Kill"" recently and completed 50% of it. It is about the reporter who reported on Harvey Weinstein. It keeps repeating the same thing over and over, with a little bit of information added from time to time. I do not want to give up on it but I am fed up with the drag. I do want to complete it but I have much better books I want to read. I thought I could complete it before starting a new book, but I cannot.

 How often do you guys leave a book after reading a part of it and then come back to it later?",books,535
"I‚Äôve been reading the broken earth trilogy and for some reason I‚Äôve been picturing Alabaster as Bill Pullman. I have no idea why he popped into my head but he feels like the perfect actor to pull off that character.

"Don't know that I've read anything more eloquently relevant in a long time. 

'When a slave rebels, it is nothing much to the people who read about it later. Just thin words on thinner paper worn finer by the friction of history. (‚ÄúSo you were slaves, so what?‚Äù they whisper. Like it‚Äôs nothing.) But to the people who live through a slave rebellion, both those who take their dominance for granted until it comes for them in the dark, and those who would see the world burn before enduring one moment longer in ‚Äútheir place‚Äù‚Äî

That is not a metaphor, Essun. Not hyperbole. I did watch the world burn. Say nothing to me of innocent bystanders, unearned suffering, heartless vengeance. When a comm builds atop a fault line, do you blame its walls when they inevitably crush the people inside? No; you blame whoever was stupid enough to think they could defy the laws of nature forever. Well, some worlds are built on a fault line of pain, held up by nightmares. Don‚Äôt lament when those worlds fall. Rage that they were built doomed in the first place.'

"I used to be embarrassed that it takes me forever to take a book. I like to only read a couple chapters a day so the story can sit with me for a while. It stirs in the back of my mind throughout the day and it helps me get immersed in the world of the story. It took me over a month to finish Empire Falls but I think taking so long made it special for me. I'm gearing up to start East of Eden and I'm so excited to make that my autumn read this year.

Is this crazy? I always read posts from people who manage to read 50+ books a year and wonder if I'm missing out on something.",books,579
"I hated reading for basically my whole life.  I got by in elementary school by reading the bare minimum of assigned books (if I read them at all, spark notes usually sufficed).  In college I tried to read the textbooks but I hated it.  Junior and senior year I didn‚Äôt even purchase the books because I knew it was a waste of money, I wasn‚Äôt going to read them.  Looking back, I don‚Äôt know how I had as good of grades as I did.  I picked up Game of Thrones before the first season was released on HBO a blew through those.  For the next 5 years or so, GOT were the only books I read.  There were years where I didn‚Äôt read a single book.  

After college I was recruited by a company and have worked there for 8 years now.  I love it.  The guy who owns the company is AWESOME.  They treat their employees really really well.  For example, I broke my back a few years ago and had to go into emergency spinal surgery.  He told me to take 3 weeks off, fully paid, no hit on my vacation time, &amp; then work from home while I recovered.  Who does that?!?  He and I have grown closer of the years and he has become a fantastic mentor (both in my career and my life).  He was the one that pushed me to start reading more.  He recommended all sorts of books (most of which I really liked).  We started a weekly book club just for the two of us.  We pick a book and know out 2-3 chapters a week, then discuss it for 30-45 minutes.  We started off by reading only business books and now read business, ‚Äòself help‚Äô and even some fiction.  Thanks to him, I constantly have 3-4 books going at a time.  I ready 14 books last year and am on #17 this year.  

**What I‚Äôm really getting at is that I appreciated what my boss did for me.  He helped me discover the joy of reading.  He pushed me down the right path of personal growth and continued learning.**  This year my favorite read has by far been Meditations by Marcus Aurelius (closely followed by Atomic Habits by James Clear).   **I can only hope to help someone else discover reading like I did.**  I passed my copy of Dune on to a buddy with the hopes that he enjoys it (and so we can talk about it before the movie comes out!).  My brother is also a huge book worm and it has given us a ton more to talk about.  Now that I‚Äôm a reader, he has been recommending all sorts of goo books.  

All this reading has made me realized I really missed out on A TON of great reads.  I‚Äôm trying to play catch up on a lot of books I should have read by now (EX: 1984, Fahrenheit 451, Of Mice and Men/other Steinbeck, and a whole huge list of other classics).  If anyone has copies of some of these must read classics that they want to donate, PM me, or leave a rec. below.",books,2703

"Don't remember where or when I was recommended this book but it stood in the back of the queue for a while and now I finally decided to pick it up.
I really enjoyed it! I thought the reading experience was very pleasant. Short book, not very plot heavy but Jiles' writing and the two main characters made it really worth it. I loved the setting (late 1800s Texas) and despite it being somewhat wordy and description heavy style of writing it was a relatively easy read for someone who doesn't have English as a first language.

My only problem with the book were the plotarmor... Kiltaj survives, Venka well... also
N√∂-Csa lives, and they take him away alive so we will see him for sure... everyone dies, a whole city is massacred and tortured, but somehow not one but 2 friends of Zsin survive... I mean we see like 2 named, important characters die, a guy who was a few years older then Zsin but he met him at Szinegard, and Ircsa, the strategy teacher... Oh and Altan but well, that was a heroic ending self sacrifice stuff, so not really what I mean.

What I really loved is that the main character is following her goal. Not like 90%of books where the wise masters word is followed and teaches the hotheaded MC... nah, lets just destroy a whole continent cuz I want revenge. Loved it.

- Micronesia
- Monaco
- Niger
- San Marino
- Timor-Leste

"After having just read it, I have to say that I thought it was very good story that kept me engaged throughout. I liked it overall, although not on the same level of The Brothers Karamazov or One Hundred Years of Solitude in terms of a family saga novel. I would rank those latter two in my top 10 books of all time though, so no shame in that. 

But does anyone feel that by having the ‚Äútimshel‚Äù mistranslation, not the mention the fact that it is mistakenly written as timshel instead of timshol in the first place, significantly detracts from the novel?

I feel it wouldn‚Äôt be such a big deal if the novel wasn‚Äôt built around this, but because it‚Äôs such a major component and a central theme/parting lesson, it cheapens the story overall, at least for me. Something like having a historical movie that is riddled with inaccuracies, e.g. Braveheart or Gladiator, they can still be well done/highly enjoyable overall, but it impacts the story.",books,944
"I really enjoyed the series, with the exception of the latest book, which I still liked, but I think it was a bit of a tie together for things to come.

So I've been lurking on r/suggestmeabook for a few months, and on almost every thread there is someone recommanding The Secret History by Donna Tartt as their favourite book of all time, so when I saw it in a second hand bookshop the other day, I HAD to buy it to see what the fuss was all about.

I just started it this week and I'm only at the second chapter but so far I feel like I'm watching the series How to Get Away with Murder. Here are some of the similarities I noticed:

- College setting
- The mysterious and famous teacher who does not abide by the rules and is super innovative in their way to give class
- The five elite students chosen by the teacher and who have private class with him/her
- The murder ""flashback"" at the very beginning of the book/series 
- The new student who is not as rich as the others (""Waitlist""/Richard who's on a scholarship)

And I'm sure I'm missing even more similarities!

It's not possible, one has surely influenced the other?! Or is it a big coincidence?",books,1052
"I'm a huge Danielewski fan, having collected two copies of House of Leaves, The Whalestoe Letters, The Fifty Year Sword, and Only Revolutions. I've picked up Little Blue Kite, but I'm afraid of reading it, I'm not sure why. But years ago, when The Familiar first came out, I picked up the first volume and got completely lost in its pages. With entire chapters written in a different language,  I felt as if I'd never be able to finish it. I really want to like it and was hoping for some direction. Did others that have been able to get through the twist and turns of the Familiiar have to have some sort of translator to understand what they were reading or did you just skip over entire chapters? Any suggestions would be welcome. I feel I've done a disservice to Danielewski by not reading it, and want to be able to complete the collection someday.

"I'm wondering what people thought of this series. 

The Shadow of the Wind and Angels Game felt like two very separate stories but set in the same world. Just hints of the connection. The Prisoner of Heaven threaded the two together and indicated a greater story and then The Labyrinth of Spirits closed it all off.

I really enjoyed the first two, was intrigued by the third and then thoroughly disappointed by the last book. I felt that by sealing the story and removing all the mystery and supernatural themes it became a bit mundane for me. It took away all that enthusiasm i felt after the first book. 

I'm wondering if giving the series another read, without a break would be a good idea. What did people think? Were you happy with how it ended?",books,752

The level of detail that went into Jake's journey through the 50s and 60s alone was simply breathtaking, but the way Jake's romance with Sadie progressed was lovely. 

I'm not going to lie, I had to take a break and shed a year towards the end when he finally talks to JFK on the phone. It just felt to me like all what Jake went through, was entirely justified by that call. 

The ending was very well done. Certainly I'd class is as ""bittersweet.""

"Hello fellow book lovers!

I'm a game developer working on a project that turns literary, quotable extracts from books (mostly novels, but some non-fiction) into puzzles.  Each extract needs to be roughly 2-3 sentences long.  I'm just wondering what authors/books people would recommend I read to find great new sources of quotable extracts for a project like this.  

The best extracts are self-contained (i.e. you don't need to know anything outside of the extract to fully understand its context) and tend to elicit a strong emotional/intellectual reaction or instead create a vivid, beautiful mental image in the mind of the reader.  Not looking for negative, depressing or otherwise ""unpleasant to a standard audience"" type stuff.  

If you've recently read anything where you find yourself really savoring a particular paragraph like the above several times per chapter, I'd love to hear your recommendations.

Some examples of authors that have yielded LOTS of great extracts so far from this project:  J.A. Baker (""The Peregrine""), Madeline Miller (""Circe"" and ""The Song of Achilles""), Annie Dillard (""Pilgrim at Tinker Creek""), Pico Iyer, Iris Murdoch, Willa Cather, Anthony Doerr, Mark Helprin, Dervla Murphy.

"From to kill a mocking bird to Harry Potter I always love books with trial scenes, the fear of the prisioner at the punishment, or his indifference. The inteligence of a lawyer or the advance of a ruthless and unfair justice are some of the elements I love about these scenes. In my opinion the court room captures many of tge extreme sides of human behavior.

"### The reason I post this is I just finished reading *How to Stop Time by Matt Haig* but not limited to so lets talk about it..!

Might a lengthy read but we are all here to read aren't we? 


I don't have a lot of *free time* but I specifically create time for reading books in my daily life and it's a bummer if the book doesn't satisfy me at the end. I might be in minority but I don't enjoy the act as f reading but instead I enjoy a good read, a good story, a good usage of words next to one another. If a book rises my expectations throughout the reading but then doesn't reach to that, I genuinely feel bad. How do you feel about this?


If a book starts boring then ends boring I am totally cool with that it means that this book is like that. You don't have to like it but if it shows a great potential then drops down...it's not something I can tolerate to.


##How to Stop Time [No Spoilers] 
The book was delightful to read, pretty interesting topic well executed, keeps your connected, character arc is well balanced but....has a *not so great* ending. It just left me wondering whether the author has been forced to rush the ending because of financial issues or the publisher but it definitely has a dull ending compared to the rest of the book.

No spoilers but it's one of those books that reveals itself in layers as you go and once you have a handle on it it really leaves you thinking.  It had me going back and reading some stuff to solidify my thoughts.  The author chooses her words carefully.

"My twin cousins' birthday is coming and I was thinking of buying a book for each. I decided for Anne of Green Gables and Journey to the Center of the Earth.

One of the girls is very introverted, a bit numb, and has a complicated family situation. Basically she doesn't really belong anywhere and she can feel that. I thought that Anne of Green Gables could give her a bit of a more positive outlook on life and maybe some passion and enthusiasm.

The other twin lives with her parents. She takes a lot of responsibility taking care of her two younger sisters and most of the chores. She says she likes geography, but she has a very dull life. I thought an adventure book could make her life a bit more interesting. 

The issue is that I have never read Anne of Green Gables and the last time I read Journey to the Center of the Earth was 20 years ago. So I don't really remember them well and I am not sure if these books are age-appropriate or good ideas as gifts.

"First off, Wow. What an awesome reading experience that was. I enjoyed this book from start to finish and am grateful to SK for the enrichment to my life since starting to read. 

** Spoilers From Here On **

The atmosphere of this book was astounding. I have never read the book before and only ever depended on movies - which I now know is a bad idea - to fill the gap.

The movie really never puts across just how alive the actual hotel is. It's not just a few ghosts and a man going crazy with cabin fever like the movie seems to suggest but the whole thing had its own life and presence.

Also you get no sense of just how powerful Danny is and how grown up a 5 year old has to be in this terrible situation the family find themselves in.

I also enjoyed how Dick had a much more important role in the rescue. The movie really was dire on this aspect.

It's crazy how a movie i once saw as a masterpiece of cinema can really just dissolve into the floating turd it really is when compared to the novel. There is no wonder SK hated it,it missed out so much of what this book really was about... I mean what the hell is the talking index finger all about (Tony).

I'm am just so grateful and thankful that I'm finally able to read these books after such a long time of basically being in the dark and missing out on this whole new world of enjoyment. (anyone wondering why see my old post, it's a long story)

I found this subreddit in March, when the COVID-19 pandemic escalated in the United States. I suddenly found I had an incredible amount of time on my hands. Which prompted me to start reading. 

Finding this subreddit and engaging in rich discussions about literature turned reading into a mere pass time into an obsession. I set myself the goal of reading a book a week until the end of the year (35 books in total). Literature is such a gift -- a fundamental part of humanity.

I don't care for the story so far, nor the setting and the prose is not of my liking. The very slow pacing bothers me the most. I'm a hundred pages in, and the story can be reduced to: a family moves to a new place, there is a cemetery for pets which bothers the mom and the daughter and the neighbor is (or seems to be) a nice guy.

"The Martian Review.
TICKET TO MARS. AND A LOT OF LAUGHTER.

Released 2011

Rating by me: 8.5/10

Andy Weir, this guy has done a great job and has put together a book that is not only realistic to extreme lengths but is funny as hell. It has an apocalyptic vibe which for some reason is not scary at all (well, except sometimes).

The story revolves around Mark Watney, an Astronaut who is deserted on Mars. Yes, the planet. With nothing but an exceptional sense of humor, a mediocre understanding of botany (eh, Plant Science), and a bountiful of bad luck, he challenges the odds of his survival.

The science in this book is real, not that I am encouraging you to try working with Hydrazine (Highly Flammable, Mom will shout at you), but it makes you think you're smart and are capable of being a scientist. The story is quite gripping and funny even though the entire burden of keeping you stuck to the book is held by only one character.

The book has a lot of swear words, but I don't blame Mark, he is stuck on Mars so cut him some slack. It never goes down the drain like many books of a similar apocalyptical genre would do, where the protagonist loses the determination to fight off the negative element. While you read the story, you will feel as if you are there alongside Mark, and last I checked, everyone needs a getaway from their crazy lives. And Mars isn't all that bad, except for the poor oxygen and water supply.

Let this be it. Getaway to Mars. Aboard 'Hermes'.

Till Next Time. Goodbye You Lovely Readers.

"My dad read to me and my siblings every night for years, even if he had work the next day and had to go to bed early. At first, he picked the books out, and we devoured The Hobbit, Wizard of Oz, James and the Giant Peach, Bunnicula, Narnia, you name it. 

As we got older we scarfed down The Series of Unfortunate Events, The Mysterious Benedict Society, Ella Enchanted, Warrior Cats (he wasn‚Äôt too keen on this series, but I kept buying them with my allowance so I gave him no choice), Harry Potter, etc. Some of my best memories are of curling up with him and reading through Calvin and Hobbes for the 7th time.

She may be the victim, and rightly so, but some just lets the bullying drag on until 'she gets enough' but *still* hasn't have a backbone. Many have great female characters, don't get me wrong, but quite some are either too forgiving to the male characters later on, or us reader feel that she is frustrating and every time she sees the male she melts.

"Let me guess, they‚Äôre an amazing kick-ass warriors, that are strongly independent and just as good as the boys in everything. That‚Äôs about it. Being a fierce warrior is not a personality trait.

So many rising books on the top charts for YA (and some adult) fantasy are like this.

Again, I do love that writers are giving a more modern portrayal of women, but being a women myself, it feels a bit patronizing and one dimensional. I love when there is fierceness mixed with soft tenderness and more personality traits and moments of personal character growth, like actual human beings.

Now I know that what was a scholarly edition and what is now a scholarly edition may have changed. But, would anyone explain what differentiates a scholarly book from a plain book?",books,310
"What can I say. Its actually GOOD!

&amp;#x200B;

Sure, its in the format I like.  I enjoy blog posts vs extended scientific debates.  I enjoy short stories over novels.    Its easier to make a small decent quality meal vs a three course entree which ends up boring you.

&amp;#x200B;

The short stories are engaging and have a nice personal touch to them.    Its wide variety of jobs of individuals has actually reminded me of the book ""Working"" by Studs Terkel.

&amp;#x200B;

The best stories are, of course, about the people not involved with the military.  Zombie stories are best done like survivalist stories. That way you can make the behavior of the people actually believable and gripping!  Most of the military stories involve absolutely idiotic behavior and planning.  Mindless zombies with no strategy have no real hope of taking on an organized military...so the only way to make them win is to give the commanders severe mental deficits. 

&amp;#x200B;

Once you forget about the above...the stories are well written!    Humans turn into cannibals.  Humans bring their gamecubes they cannot play to remind them.   People get saved.  I ""liked"" the story of the Martin Shkreli pharma guy who made the fake zombie vaccine.  People gradually turn into monsters in order to fend off monsters. A trope, but one which at least makes sense.

"Victober is a month-long readathon in October and is devoted to reading Victorian (1837-1901) literature! This year it is hosted YouTubers lucythereader, Books and Things, and Kate Howe.

This is my first Victober, and I haven't read a lot of Victorian literature before, so this will be exciting. I've read Jane Eyre (1847), The Importance of Being Earnest (1895), The Yellow Wallpaper (1892), The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1886), some Edgar Allan Poe short stories, and that's pretty much it. I enjoyed most of them, so I'm excited to see what this readathon has in store for me.

What I'm planning on reading this Victober:
- The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde 
- Little Women by Louisa May Alcott
- Far From the Madding Crowd by Thomas Hardy
- North and South by Elizabeth Gaskell
- (maybe) Great Expectations by Charles Dickens

What are you planning on reading for Victober and what are your favourite Victorian classics?",books,949
"There are books in which you travel unseen next to your dear protagonist. That so unusual, yet so relatable, someone does not know you are there, of course, but you know that someone so well. By the time you turn that last page you know not just what that person did, but the scent of his favorite tea or that her back stiffens at the sound of her mother‚Äôs voice. They matter, these details, because together they somehow make all the decisions that moved the plot along make sense.

Then there are other books that guide you into uncertainty, grasping for bits of information that must be connected, but you can‚Äôt be sure how or why until the end, where the joy is in tracing back over your steps to see what you missed or misunderstood. 

Rare is the book that does both well. 

Imagine a man that is kind enough in his actions, both big and small, that it would not occur to him to be otherwise. Much of who he is, what he could be, is pushed down inside, cramped and miserable, while his life is devoted to the care of others. 

Then, in the midst of all the grey nothingness that his life becomes, gold. It‚Äôs a gift, far too fine and extravagant to have a place in his life. Yet there it is, no question about it. Who would even think of him to give him such a thing and why are questions that perplex him, of course. He would delve into them further if he could. The work hours are so long, though, and he lives in such a dangerous time and place. He might not survive the week anyway. It‚Äôs best to use his time making his death as little an inconvenience for others as possible, he decides. 

When he doesn‚Äôt die and the gift giver appears to be involved in an impossible way, we must run to keep up with the changes in this man‚Äôs life that lead him into a new existence. His world becomes so vast and beautiful it would be a good book even if the ending wasn‚Äôt so amazing. It is though. It is beautiful and unexpected (at least it was for me) and kind, so kind. 

Whether you prefer to shadow people that become more real and valuable to you with every word or you need to escape into strange events that you know aren‚Äôt real, but are so believable you will feel the mist of them in your everyday life please read &gt;!‚ÄúThe Watchmaker of Filigree Street‚Äù by Natasha Pulley&lt;!. 

If you‚Äôve already read it, please let me know your thoughts. I love getting others people‚Äôs insights on books.",books,2404

It was a scholastic book from the ‚Äòmy America‚Äô or ‚Äòdear America‚Äô series. It had a smooth matte cover.

"I'm a fairly casual Stephen King fan and, having already read most of his books, I decided to use all this free time to pick up the uncut edition of The Stand (with the intent of eventually moving on to the Dark Tower series afterward). 

The first half(ish) of the book was really compelling but I've now reached the point where all the characters have come together in Boulder and...I'm losing interest fast. 

It reminds me of the less-interesting seasons of The Walking Dead (which is really saying something, considering it's not the most compelling show even at its strong points) where the characters join up with a community and everyone plays nice for a while before the shit inevitably hits the fan. There's just a feeling of 'been there, done that, decided not to buy the tshirt'. And having every other chapter be an hourlong read isn't helping much either. 

Obviously I can't ask ""Does it get better?"" without opening myself up to spoilers, but I'm curious whether this is a problem other people have faced. After all, it's an extended version of an already-long novel, and King is known for being a bit self-indulgent, so I don't mind a bit of a narrative lull before things pick up again. But boy...I don't think I can do 200 pages of people doing laundry and inviting each other over for dinner in the meantime. 

Anyone have thoughts or input? Vague spoilers are fine.

"So I‚Äôm major bookworm and I own paperbacks, hardbacks, ebooks on my kindle, and manga/graphic novels/comics. 
My bookcase has been halved into two sections, one side for my manga collection and the other half for my absolute favourite author Sherrilyn McQueen. 
My kindle is for all other books that I love but don‚Äôt want to have on my shelves. 
So I purchased two ebooks and one hardback book
The hardback book is called Hex Life and it‚Äôs a collection of short stories from different authors ( one is Sherrilyn McQueen and the other is Kelly Armstrong), this book will arrive at my door tomorrow. 
On the Wings of War is from the Soulbound series by Hailey Turner and is the book I‚Äôm currently reading, her books are brilliant especially this series and I‚Äôve been hooked since book one.   This is the first proper book I‚Äôve been reading in a while as I‚Äôve been rereading a certain manga series constantly (Inuyasha) since lockdown and have only just managed to pull myself away from it when On the Wings of War was released. 
The final book is called Second and his Bonded by Kiki Clark, it‚Äôs the second book from her Kincaid Pack series. 
I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll really enjoy all of these as the authors are all amazing in their own fields.",books,1232
"I recently read Parable of the Sower and absolutely loved it and it is one of my new favourite books of all time, and highly recommend it to everyone! First of all, Olamina‚Äôs story is once again phenomenal, it‚Äôs raw and real and so tragic and beautiful. It‚Äôs a phenomenal exploration of so many issues, and the things Octavia E Butler predicts and sees are borderline prophetic. And it‚Äôs still one of the best books I‚Äôve read. 

Now I have read Parable of the Talents and am very much conflicted. Long rant about Parable of the Talents incoming, apologises in advance, but have to get this off my chest, I‚Äôm probably gonna say a lot for stupid things so forgive me that and I do realise that I‚Äôm probably trying to rationalise something it is irrational lol but I can‚Äôt help it.  (Main points are in TLDR) 

I had a major, major problem: I hated Asha Vere in this book. It bothers me so much more than it should and it‚Äôs difficult to explain why, I actually feel she is poorly written as a character and created to fulfil a very specific role in the book, she seems to have one main trait (in that she dislikes her mother) and nothing beyond that... yet in my opinion this book is actually more about her and her perspective than it is about Olamina, despite Olamina playing a far larger role.

The way she talks about Olamina, the anger and almost hatred she seems to have for her, which makes absolutely no sense to me and have no justification. She seems to blame her mother for everything that has happened, several times she says her mother should have moved to the other community with Bankole, as if her mother could have possibly predicted what would happen, as if her mother is to blame for wanting to stay with her friends and build a community with them. Several times Asha also talks about Earthseed being bad and how her mother might have been a ‚Äúwholly admirable person‚Äù if she hadn‚Äôt created Earthseed. Yet never once does she mention the fact that because of Earthseed her mother enabled groups of completely traumatised and abused people to live happy lives, never once does she mentioned that her mother saved so many people, that she gave so many people hope. That her mother was just, in every sense of the word, a good person. She went out of her way, putting herself in danger, in a world were no one could be expected to be good, to help strangers - just random people on the streets, even people who didn‚Äôt agree with her, even people who made fun of her beliefs. And yet Asha never once talks about this, never praises her mother for these things. She seems to have only criticisms.

Now I‚Äôm not saying Olamina is perfect. Clearly she was obsessive, she was also quite close minded, and she tries to manipulate people to her way of thinking at times. And these are things which should no doubt be critiqued and looked down upon, despite them being common in virtually every belief system. But there seems to be no balance in this book. It seems that Asha constantly looks for the worst motives, constantly tries to find the bad aspects of her mother. I realise that she has been indoctrinated, I realise that she was abused and had a childhood that I don‚Äôt even want to think about. But by the time of her writing this, she is a grown woman isn‚Äôt she? She is supposedly disillusioned of religion, and is a critical thinker. Yet reading all these absolutely heartbreaking diaries of her mother and she only ever seems to see the absolute worse? Her mother searches for her without stopping until other people convince her she has to move on and even then she still looks, yet apparently she cares about Earthseed so much more. And Asha seems to feel little to no sympathy for everything that happened to her mother - though she had plenty of sympathy for others - other than a few lines; which honestly feel a little throwaway (about how she wouldn‚Äôt wish what her mother went through on anyone). I just don‚Äôt understand were it all came from, it‚Äôs not just resentment, it‚Äôs a true dislike that she seems to believe completely logical and justifiable. It honestly reads to me like she thinks her mum is just a bad person.

And what irritates me more is that Marcus seems to get a free pass in all of this from Asha. Never mind that he supported a facist and ignored the awful practices of his group, never mind that he essentially kept a child away from her mother and left her in an abusive home as a result, never mind that he made the child think her mother was dead, never mind that he made the mother think her child was dead - and yes I know he was also put through awful things, but so was Olamina, why does he get an excuse because of his trauma but Olamina doesn‚Äôt? I don‚Äôt remember one time her saying something like ‚Äúi cant believe he would do something like that‚Äù or the fact that in his ignorance he hurt far more people that Olamina ever did... And I understand that she loves him because he protected her and cared for her but shouldn‚Äôt she have some reactions to such a major betrayal? And I simply don‚Äôt understand how she is able to look at her mother with such disdain despite everything her mother did to try and find her, despite all the good things she tried to do for other people, yet Marcus she loves unquestionably. Apparently he just wanted to ‚Äúmake earth a better place‚Äù. This really bothered me, probably the most in the book.

I do realise that Asha‚Äôs jealous of Earthseed, that she thinks her mother loves Earthseed so much more than she does her, but honestly I don‚Äôt understand why... her mother no doubt loves Earthseed, and no doubt Olamina is obsessed with Earthseed, but she also spent years searching for her daughter. She spent years thinking about her and loving her, but she also had to move on, she had to live her life, she helped other people, she fought for a better world, even if you don‚Äôt agree with her vision, you have to at least respect that a little, don‚Äôt you? I mean it‚Äôs not like she wen‚Äôt around killing people, or forcing her beliefs on others...
I could understand that Asha irrationally blames her mother, that she irrationally can‚Äôt bring herself to hate Marcus assuming that she also recognised that it was irrational. I could accept that, expect it‚Äôs not presented that way in the slightest. To me it was presented as if Asha was perfectly reasonable in the way she felt, that she was right to judge her mother so harshly, that she had every reason to to think that way. And while that may be true once, after she read her mothers diaries? After she found out what Marcus had kept from her? After she realised that her mother spent years helping people, caring for strangers, and still looking for her? And yet it seems to change nothing. This line ‚Äúshe hadn‚Äôt found me. And uncle Marc had. I wondered just how hard she‚Äôd really looked.‚Äù Is just so insanely unfair, and honestly I feel it‚Äôs so unrealistic that she has no reaction whatsoever to what her uncle did other than one line at the end saying she was angry with him, but even then she instantly goes onto say how much more she was annoyed with her mother. 

Honestly I don‚Äôt really understand why Earthseed was getting so much hate from Asha either, as an atheist I see Earthseed as almost a religious ‚Äòpersonification‚Äô of atheism, and it seems fairly reasonable in most regards, to me anyway. She constantly calls it a cult and seems to think it‚Äôs almost immoral, and I don‚Äôt really understand this at all. She‚Äôs not religious as far as I can tell so I‚Äôm not sure what her objection actually is... i guess the Destiny? Taking away money from other areas (even though if it wasn‚Äôt for Earthseed those other areas wouldn‚Äôt have been getting any help in the first place) and anyway that‚Äôs one of the most reasonable parts of Earthseed I would argue, especially given what we now know about climate change. I feel like this was just another thing she could hate but without much logical reason.

TLDR: I don‚Äôt understand why Asha judges Olamina so harshly and unfairly even after reading her diaries. I don‚Äôt understand why Marcus seems to get a free pass after being a pretty damn terrible human being in so, so many ways. I don‚Äôt understand why there isn‚Äôt any balance in the ways Asha sees Olamina and why she completely ignores all the good her mother did, yet doesn‚Äôt care one bit about all the bad her uncle did. 

Once again sorry for rant, and hope I didn‚Äôt put  anyone off these books, they really are amazing and so worth reading, but I haven‚Äôt seen many people talk about these things and I really want to figure out if I‚Äôm just being judgemental or if I‚Äôm not understanding certain things or if lots of people actually agree with me.

"Over time, one of the habits I‚Äôve developed is to highlight and write notes directly in the books I am reading as I read them. Then after a period of time has passed (usually about two weeks or so), I go back through the book and pull out all of the best notes and ideas that I came across into a separate document for each book.

I‚Äôve been doing this for quite some time now (probably around 10 years or so), so I've collected a long list of notes on some of the best books I've read and continue to collect more and more.

Though I was a bit hesitant at first to share all of these notes with the world, in sticking with the principles that make reading so powerful, I am sharing my notes here as a way to hopefully help others develop their own ideas and to encourage more people to read some of these great books.

"I personally don't have anyone who can, or knows someone who can speed read, so I'm asking my fellow Redditors to cast some light on this topic.

The reason why I'm asking this is because I'm a little jealous when I scroll through Goodreads and stumble upon users that have more than 3000 books under their belt, and judging by their avatar still didn't even hit 30 years of age.

I read a bit about it and tried it, and while I did succeed in lowering the time of reading pages, it was difficult and I didn't quite catch all the details, which after a while proved really bad cause I didn't know what was happening anymore.

There's so many books out there! And I know the obvious answer is: ""Shut up, read your books and enjoy them"", the fact is that, if I read them at my own pace, I'll read significantly less in my life (during the years my reading ability stayed more or less the same).

"I‚Äôve always been interested Goethe as german intellectuals like Freud, Nietzsche and Schopenhauer would use his writings to convey a point or to praise his writings, and now I can see why they would.

Because it being a ‚Äúclassic‚Äù literature, I always imagined it‚Äôd be closer to a work of art- that is dense, deep, and not at all fun to read.

Faust 1 was amazing and much easier than I had originally anticipated (though I probably missed out a lot on the lyricism &amp; subtlety) For the first time in my life I finished an entire book within a day.

"I finished it yesterday and I love it. Really, really love it. I love how long the dialogue is and I love how Salinger describes each member of the Glass family! Like they're so damn vivid in my head, especially Zooey. What a perfect, charming asshole (I say this lovingly). I was really iffy about him when he was first introduced since the impression I got from Buddy's letter was that he was a nice guy with strong opinions. I was right about the strong opinions part, but he's not really a nice guy. &gt;!But damn that part when he called the house phone to talk to Franny, it was so damn endearing even if I'm still not sure what his goal was by doing it. Can someone explain that part for me? The analyses I see online are a bit hard to understand.!&lt;

I think another reason why I loved it so much was that I saw a lot myself in Franny. Like a lot, from the questions about religion to the way she cried in the bathroom in that one part, and I'm the youngest kid in the family. Also a girl.

My family also has a lot of parallels with the Glass family. &gt;!I've lost two of my older brothers, the eldest and the fourth-eldest, like Seymour and Walt, respectively. The Glass siblings consist of two girls and three boys, my family has two boys and three girls excluding myself (I'm definitely nitpicking here).  I've had that experience of being berated by my older brother for half an hour to the point of uncontrollable sobbing, and this particular brother is the second-youngest, just like Zooey. And I was going through something vaguely similar to Franny's situation, in which I stopped going to school for a few months because of mental health issues. There's this one part in Zooey's speech to Franny that was exactly like what my brother said. You can imagine my shock there when I read it. !&lt;

It definitely felt like the book was speaking to me, which is why I liked it/was creeped out so much. But I don't know, what do you think? I need to hear the parts that people didn't like, I'm 95% sure that I'm blind to the flaws because of my bias.",books,2064

"A few possibilities:  Do you think he really thought Pala would be an ideal society?  Or was he actually illustrating the theme that rejecting the classic pillars of civilization that have allowed man to survive leads to their downfall soon after?  Or is he merely alluding to the idea that it was indeed ""too good to be true"" and ultimately impractical in light of human nature?  


I've seen many people imply that Pala is Huxley's idea of a utopia to counter the dystopia he illustrated in Brave New World, but it seems like there must be more intricacy to it than that. The societal developments he outlined were likely novel ideas at the time, but have become cliche in the years since (much as he presciently predicted much of modern society's ills in Brave New World). So I am assuming he meant something deeper than just ""Pala is a great place and how society should be but due to the greed of simple-minded people it's about to be destroyed.""",books,951
"I've just read the novel, thoroughly enjoyed Bulgakov's wit, and I understand the aspect of it being a satire of the time, and appreciate the absurdity that even the devil could not corrupt soviet Russia any more than it had corrupted itself.  But in light of the way that Woland (Satan) Is constantly wreaking havoc and yet can never be found by the authorities, what I‚Äôm picking up as the main theme is the illustration of the fact that the devil (and his minions) constantly causes people to corrupt themselves, and yet the vast majority of humans still act like he does not or could not exist (e.g. stealing heads in broad daylight, putting on scandalous seances, the antics of his posse appearing unapologetically in public, etc. yet never being found by the authorities or any of the individuals who attempt to hunt him down on their own).  Meanwhile those who acknowledge his existence and recognize him for what he is often gain pretty much every earthly desire or power they covet by embracing his corrupting power, but in the long run have no spiritual power of any consequence compared to Woland or Yeshua (Margarita, the Master, Natasha, etc.).  And even then, I believe Woland's nature is only alluded to rather than expressly stated.  Unless I'm misremembering, I'm pretty sure the closest anyone gets to actually calling him the devil is a bunch of times when he's basically like 'You know who I am right?' to which they'll acknowledge who he is but never outright state that he's Satan.  


Then you have the counterpoint of Yeshua and Pilate, and Yeshua is clearly special, but no one acknowledges His nature, and He is tracked down and killed unceremoniously, and everyone goes on with their lives like nothing of consequence has happened.  Only Pilate (albeit too late) and Matthew the apostle recognize His significance, and it leads me to wonder if Bulgakov is pointing out how quickly, easily, and thoughtlessly people are willing to reject the possibility of an all-powerful savior, despite the evil that is all around them and the visible evidence of spiritual warfare in their lives and the lives of people around them.  To me this is further illustrated in the symbolism of the fact that Woland happens to show up in Moscow right when society has become so ""refined"" and ""enlightened"" that it's elites are beginning to deny the fact that Yeshua ever existed to begin with.  There's also the minor theme of Soviet society's disdain for true artistry (in the form of the Master's rejection by the literary elites, likely akin to Bulgakov's own feelings about his work which was never appreciated until after he was dead) and their overwhleming enthusiasm about cheap tricks and spurious profundity illustrated by the uproar over the seance and the works of the laughably pompous literary club, with a veritable ""who's who"" of authors of undeserved repute.",books,2879
"I've just read the novel, thoroughly enjoyed Bulgakov's wit, and I understand the aspect of it being a satire of the time, and appreciate the absurdity that even the devil could not corrupt soviet Russia any more than it had corrupted itself.  But in light of the way that Woland (Satan) Is constantly wreaking havoc and yet can never be found by the authorities, what I‚Äôm picking up as the main theme is the illustration of the fact that the devil (and his minions) constantly causes people to corrupt themselves, and yet the vast majority of humans still act like he does not or could not exist (e.g. stealing heads in broad daylight, putting on scandalous seances, the antics of his posse appearing unapologetically in public, etc. yet never being found by the authorities or any of the individuals who attempt to hunt him down on their own).  Meanwhile those who acknowledge his existence and recognize him for what he is often gain pretty much every earthly desire or power they covet by embracing his corrupting power, but in the long run have no spiritual power of any consequence compared to Woland or Yeshua (Margarita, the Master, Natasha, etc.).  And even then, I believe Woland's nature is only alluded to rather than expressly stated.  Unless I'm misremembering, I'm pretty sure the closest anyone gets to actually calling him the devil is a bunch of times when he's basically like 'You know who I am right?' to which they'll acknowledge who he is but never outright state that he's Satan.",books,1502

"I started the Hunger Games series back in August and completed the whole three books in just a matter of two weeks. I just completed the final one and holy shit. 
This book has been brilliantly plotted and paced. All the twists and the compelling action are not only entertaining but they serve a higher purpose of what the whole series is about. Rarely do I see this perfect blend of artistic perfection along with gripping entertainment. 
I totally didn't see the end coming. Katniss losing her sister just because Coin decided to drop a bomb on a group of children to make the Capitol look like they killed their own children. I knew there was something fishy with President Coin herself when it was revealed that she might have Katniss killed if she got the power of Capitol. Katniss's conversation with Snow in the end and that council meeting where Coin proposes a Hunger Games involving the Capitol kids cement the fact that Coin is no different from Snow. In overthrowing a dictator, Katniss didn't realise she was working alongside another one. Also, Katniss's grief after losing her sister is truly well written. It really made me cry. Especially the part when she and her sister's cat, who she hated, reunite. Both of are in mourning. Both of them find solace in each other's loneliness. Peeta still remains in touch with Katniss but it takes time for their relationship to come back to normal. I felt truly bad even for Haymitch. Given all that he has suffered, his death might have been a sweet release for him. 
I thoroughly enjoyed the book.

"I just finished reading the Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes and I can‚Äôt help thinking about how Snow viewed Katniss as a descendent of the Covey.

It makes me want to to go back and read all the chapters where he interacts with her. Which I usually speed read before because I thought they were boring and that snow as a villain was boring. His backstory really fleshed him out as a more 3D character.

Without a doubt, he probably knew who she came from after she sang the song to Rue, the same one Lucy sang to Maude, or the Hanging Tree in the district 13 propos.

The dreaded mockingjay that refused to die.

"Hi, I was just wondering if anyone had any advice for dealing with a massive backlog of unread books when some of those books are part of a series?

Basically, I did have quite a bad problem of buying books faster than I was reading them, which lead to fifty or so unread books being scattered throughout my bookshelf. At the start of lockdown I reorganised my bookshelves, clearing out the books that I did not like/will not reread and I put all the unread books on their own shelves. I have since been reading through these books. I do admit to feeling a certain amount of pressure to read through them all as next year I will be moving out to go to university. I promised myself that I wouldn't buy any new books until I had finished (or discovered I disliked and DNFed) all my old hoarded books (though I do confess that I caved and bought two new ones that looked interesting, and I recieved some more for my birthday).

The problem is that a lot of the books on the shelf were the first book in a series, and there were two that I really enjoyed and really want to find out what happens next. But I am worried that if I buy the other books in the series (which would be eight new books in total I think) that I will break my rule and end up growing the massive unread book pile.

I also have another minor issue in that I have been mostly sticking to ""light reading"" in lockdown as the world is ending and I was looking for something to distract and cheer me up. The issue is I have several books in the unread pile that deal with super heavy topics and I have kind of just been skirting around them, but it seems that stuff is going to continue sucking for a while. Do you have any advice for reading depressing books in depressing times?

"I have never been huge into fantasy, but I made it a goal for myself this year to read more out of my comfort zone. I first read Mistborn (which everyone on r/fantasy seems to either love, or hate because it‚Äôs so loved) and have been working through HP Lovecraft‚Äôs stuff. However another fantasy work that I was recommended was The Wandering Inn, a massive web serial that can be found here:

[https://wanderinginn.com/](https://wanderinginn.com/)

While I heard it was great, I was on the fence. First I knew it had a reputation for being extremely long, and I didn‚Äôt know how much of a commitment I wanted to make, particularly if I didn‚Äôt enjoy it. I also heard it had characters ‚Äòleveling‚Äô like an RPG, which sounded weird to me. But I gave it a try anyway, and I‚Äôve gotta tell you, I am very glad I did. I devoured the first ‚Äòvolume‚Äô way faster that I usually read, despite its length. In fact, I am very glad that it‚Äôs 7-odd volumes are so long, because it means I‚Äôll have a good amount of reading material for a while. And it‚Äôs still being written. I ended up buying the first two books on kindle to support the author, as well as have it more conveniently available, though I hope s/he adds the others on the kindle store soon.

If you‚Äôre into fantasy, or even just fun adventurous stories, I absolutely recommend this. That said, Wandering Inn is not a super thick or hard-to-get-into fantasy series, like, say, Wheel of Time (so I‚Äôve heard), but is very easy to drop into and read much like Harry Potter or Percy Jackson. A large part of this is the (very simple) premise: a regular girl from our world suddenly finds herself in a strange fantasy world. We as the audience see everything through 20-year-old Erin Solstice‚Äôs eyes, and so learn about this world at the same rate she does. Similar to the audience learning about the wizarding world through Harry Potter‚Äôs perspective, everything being told through Erin‚Äôs POV helps ease readers into the world.

Despite its length, there isn‚Äôt actually a ton of story progression in Volume 1. That‚Äôs not exactly a bad thing. While storylines and greater plots do start to become clearer near the end, this book is really about Erin learning about this world and slowly progressing. She starts with literally nothing but the clothes on her back, and has to work out basic survival, finding food and encountering strange creatures. It‚Äôs a fair amount of time before she even encounters another person she can talk to - rather than being dropped into the center of a medieval town with useful sidekick nearby to exposit everything, she finds herself instead a vast wilderness with only an abandoned inn to hint at any sign of civilization. I‚Äôm a fan of survival games (having spent way too many hours of my life on Ark: Survival Evolved), and out of all things, the first act of the story really reminded me of that. A random person dropped into the middle of a strange world, fighting to survive with anything they can, yet somehow, slowly but surely making steady progress. This feeling of ‚Äòsteady progress‚Äô is perhaps the best way to summarize Volume 1. Not all of it may be extremely important for the story as a whole, but it absolutely feels important to Erin‚Äôs personal journey, as she learns how to not only survive on this strange planet, but thrive. To build a life out of nothing. 

Along with this feel of steady progress was one of steady worldbuilding. After all, as Erin ventures further from her little inn and learns more about the outside world, so do we as readers. The whole book had a very adventurous and exploratory feel to it, which I absolutely loved. Slowly but surely the cities, races, rules, geography, and politics of the world are unveiled - never too slow to bore readers, yet never too fast to overwhelm them. Because of this, every single chapter felt important to the overall progression of the plot and Erin‚Äôs journey, even if in hindsight some of them weren‚Äôt actually needed. (I say this as a compliment - pirateaba knows how to keep a story going and the audience engaged!) In fact, I can only recall one or two chapters where I felt things dragged a little, which is pretty astounding considering its length.

As the story goes on, the POV shifts from solely being focused on Erin to exploring some other ‚Äòreal world‚Äô people that have also been stranded here - most significantly Ryoka Griffin, the deuteragonist. Ryoka is almost the exact opposite of Erin - unfriendly and antisocial while Erin is typically kind and bubbly. I almost found the two POVs switching off between them a little off-putting because they felt so different, it‚Äôs almost as if these characters were created by two different authors. However, despite the initial rough transition from one protagonist to two, I came to be really interested in both the main characters and their two largely-separate plots.  

I should probably mention the problems I had with the book, even if briefly. These weren‚Äôt huge enough to ruin my reading experience at all, but I‚Äôve seen some other reviews basically saying how Wandering Inn is the best series in the world and perfect in every way. I don‚Äôt want newcomers to go in with that mindset because yes, while it‚Äôs fantastic, there are definitely some flaws. Probably most egregious is that the writing style feels a little‚Ä¶ sloppy at first. As someone who writes fiction, I saw a lot of my earlier writing in the first portions of the Wandering Inn. Anyone who writes a lot will be familiar with it: we all go through a growing stage, and the only way to become better writers is to write some sloppier stuff first. This doesn‚Äôt mean the first third of Wandering Inn is bad - in fact, I was really hooked and enjoying it. But I was enjoying it in a casual, fun way, like watching a Marvel movie, rather than some GREAT WORLD-CHANGING PIECE OF LITERARY ART. It was a little messy, but I didn‚Äôt care - I liked the characters, I liked the world, I liked how the story was progressing. It totally hooked me. That said, I want to bring this up because people who read other reviews that gush on how this story is perfect might be turned off when they see Erin *constantly* cartoonishly narrating things to herself. Don‚Äôt go into this expecting the writing of a master. Expect a fun and gripping story. By the end of Volume 1, most of the writing kinks I noticed had been ironed out and it did sound much more professional overall.

Again, I want to stress - this wasn‚Äôt actually a huge con for me. It didn‚Äôt impact my enjoyment of the story at all. I just don‚Äôt want newcomers to walk in and expect the first half or so to sound like some literary magnum opus. It‚Äôs fun, endearing, and entertaining - so is this really a con at all? It definitely didn‚Äôt impact my enjoyment, so I‚Äôd say not really.

Another thing I should note - which may be a con or a pro depending on the reader - is that the story definitely gets darker than you may expect it to. It is actually fairly dark at first - Erin is desperately trying to survive a strange and alien world filled with murderous creatures - but her light-hearted attitude (and again, that habit of talking to herself) made me expect a more light-hearted story than I got. There‚Äôs racism, death, some truly nasty monsters, and a ‚Äòfinal battle‚Äô with something that feels more in line with a Stephen King book. While I enjoyed the light-hearted tone of the opening act, I appreciated that Wandering Inn was not afraid to deal with deeper and darker subject matter (though it never gets into super grim or edgy territory, thankfully). However, like what I mentioned about how different the two protagonists feel, some readers may experience some ‚Äòmood whiplash‚Äô which I chalk up to pirateaba trying to hone their writing skills. 

At times the two main characters were slightly hard to get into, or I took ire with them, but like I said, I ended up really liking them both. Erin is a very bubbly and friendly person and is generally easy to root for, but at times feels a little too naive, and (my personal biggest gripe with her) had a weird habit of being rude to people who were her allies. Ryoka started out as being extremely bitter and antisocial, and finished the story being‚Ä¶ well.. still bitter and antisocial, but we have a much better idea of why she‚Äôs like this, and she‚Äôs a fantastic character IMO that feels very real. Despite the occasional misstep, I really loved and found myself engaged with the two heroines. Many of the side characters are also incredibly engaging, but if I get into them, this already-way-too-long review will end up even longer.

Pacing is another strong highlight - like I said before, pirateaba almost never has a point where the story drags. The first act has a strong feeling of progression and it feels like every single sentence is important to Erin‚Äôs journey as she attempts to make sense of this strange new world. Once she starts to get settled and a little more stable, we begin to learn more about the outside world and other characters such as Ryoka, to keep things fresh. Near the end, we even get perspectives from people native to this world. There was almost no moment when things felt slow or unneeded.

In short, I loved the first volume of the Wandering Inn, despite me having kind of an aversion to fantasy, and I‚Äôm looking forward to reading more. I‚Äôm a fair amount into the second volume and am enjoying it even more so far. Anyone interested in a nice fantasy read that‚Äôs fun and easy to get into, but deeper than it initially appears, and has an exciting and engaging world, should definitely give this a try. Sure, while it may not be as polished as a professionally edited book, it‚Äôs some of the most fun I‚Äôve had with reading in years.

Pros: 

\-Exciting world and worldbuilding

\-Excellent characters

\-Steady stream of progress that keeps readers engaged

\-Great pacing

\-Great story

Cons: 

\-Main characters occasionally have weird behaviors that got on my nerves

\-Writing can feel a little unpolished",books,10020

"Hate being all ‚Äúthe book was better,‚Äù but for anyone that‚Äôs read ITOET, I‚Äôm sure you must have been excited for the movie. Charlie Kaufman making his horror debut? Sounds great! 

The first two thirds start out strong. They left a lot out, as you‚Äôre prone to do when adapting a book for film. But by the last third of the film I was just... sorely confused. It‚Äôs like they completely changed the tone of the story. And the big twist isn‚Äôt even gone over?? I am all for critically analyzing movies, but even as someone who read the book and was expecting the twist, it just DIDN‚ÄôT COME. Feels like they left it out completely, or at least BARELY explained what was actually happening to Jake. How could they do that?? I felt so disappointed. 

Anyways, I know this post is mostly about a movie but I wanted to know what anyone else who had read the book (and watched the movie by now) thought about it. There were a lot of subtle things that added a sense of unease within the film, lots of great bits of dialogue that I was thinking ‚Äúoh man, when the twist happens, this is going to have been such great foreshadowing!‚Äù but overall it fell short. Parts of the book genuinely terrified me, and it‚Äôs been a long time since I had such a strong connection to a written story, but I found myself just kind of going ‚Äúeh... okay?‚Äù with the movie.",books,1339

"Hello readers. I often read subsequent volumes of a series some time apart, enough for my memory of previous events to be at best sketchy, at worst non-existent. I have tried re-reading earlier volumes but with the size of my TBR pile this is not a preferred option. I was wondering, for those that skim read earlier books in a series, what particular methods of skimming are used? For my re-read I'm thinking of spending no more than 10% or so of the time spent to read the original. So, may I have your skim reading options please.",books,533
"I mean almost every core Harry Potter fan hates this one, but I read it anyway. Now I am so confused, I don't even know if I can represent my thoughts properly. 

First of all, some characters don't feel like themselves and a lot of other characters are entirely missing from this. But considering the fact that the known characters have grown up and these are adult version, may b that's ok. And as it's a play, there is no way every character will be there, so I guess that's fine too.

Then, the issue with time travel. Now i wanted to make a map depicting the time travels and the effects of those in the book, but I don't think i can draw a proper map. In short, I thought time travel has not been treated with proper care here. And the fact that time travel was beautifully portrayed in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of azkaban, makes me only more disappointed of this new book.

About the time travels in the book, when they first go and change the past, I.e. change Cedric's actions in the first challenge , they come back to a different reality. Ok, fine.

Then, they go back again and mess up the 2nd challenge for Cedric. Now, Albus has disappeared and it's a dark reality. Now consider this reality a base, I will refer to this reality as *base* from now on.

When Scorpius sees how bad the things in *base* are, he wants to stop the previous changes from happening. And to do so, he goes back in time again. Now, some counter intuitive things happen, or may be I'm too dumb to understand. If we are to go back in time, restoring the damage done, don't we have to fix the latest change first ? Meaning, one would think, he must first go back to the previous stage of *base*, and stop base from happening. From what we know about time travel at this point in the book, each action in the past brings vast changes, and so,one would intuitively try and fix the latest change in time.

But instead of doing that, they go back and fix the earlier change, while the latest change in time remains the same. And then, they come back to *base*.

There are several problems here. If every tiny changes in the past bring about so vast changes, doesn't this action lead to a very different reality ? Meaning, if they went from *base* to the 1st task, and stopped/reversed any changes, when they come back, should not *base* be changed ? But no, *base* remains the same. Then Scorpius goes back to attend to the latest change they made.

And after typing all this, my brain is spinning.

What happened in the book is,

Reality-----&gt; change in task 1 ----&gt; alternate reality 1 ----&gt; change in task 2 -----&gt; *base* -----&gt; fixing of the change in task 1 while task 2 is still changed ----&gt; *base* -----&gt; fixing of the change in task 2 -----&gt; reality.


What should have happened , if one follows intuition,

Reality ----&gt; change in task 1 ----&gt; alternate reality 1 ----&gt; change in task 2 ----&gt; *base* ----&gt; FIXING OF CHANGE IN TASK 2 ----&gt; alternate relaity 1----&gt; FIXING OF CHANGE IN TASK 1----&gt; reality.


Or if we followed the rules of time travel in the book, and the evnts happened as they did,

Reality-----&gt; change in task 1 ----&gt; alternate reality 1 ----&gt; change in task 2 -----&gt; *base* -----&gt; fixing of the change in task 1 while task 2 is still changed ----&gt; ALTERNATE REALITY 2/ BASE + 1 -----&gt; fixing of the change in task 2 -----&gt; reality.

"Currently reading https://imgur.com/gallery/1jMZuOc

This is my current reading pile that I'm slowly trying to work through. They're all really great and I want to finish them but find myself struggling, sometimes going for days or even weeks of not wanting to read even though I want to know what will happen next. Anyone else struggling with this slow reading problem?

Anyway, here are the books:

Labyrinth of the Lost Spirits - Started in January and still have a 3rd of the book to get through. The writing is amazing with scenes painted out so vividly. I've been enjoying taking my time reading it and savoring each chapter but just find the density/length of the book to be a bit intimidating.
My favorite genre I guess is short stories since I have a short attention span so this one is a challenge. Funnily though, I already feel I'm going to rate this 5 stars on Goodreads.

The Man Who Mistook His Wife For A Hat - Started a couple months ago and find these cases/tales so fascinating and entertaining. I normally read fiction but some of these stories are wild and yeah, stranger than fiction. It helps that I can read these like short stories but have to be in the right mood for it.

Bunny - Started a week or so ago. A little over halfway through and I don't know how I feel about this yet. Very odd. I see the dark humor in it but it hasn't really made me laugh. Very curious how it plays out though. Might finish this first since I have no idea how it'll end. 

The Plague - Started a month ago. Had this on my shelf for a couple years before finally deciding that now is a very fitting time to start on it. Only a couple chapters in so far but find it interesting how a lot of things line up or is comparable to the current pandemic. Not a very happy or fun read though so I'm taking it in small bites.

"I've been reading the Sword of Truth book series up to book #12 (Confessor) now, and feel slightly contradicted. While the plot is extremely interesting, the constant fawning over Richard by Nicci, Zedd and basically anyone who's ever known him is seriously repetitive.  

I took some time after reading the first 8 books (?) and found it helpful that Richard keeps somehow reminiscing about past events since I wouldn't be able to remembered them otherwise. At the same time, I think that as an action from the main character, it is super unrealistic. 

I also now got up to the point where Zedd and Nicci somehow gather that foreknowledge of the spell somehow corrupts it. Can someone explain to me how this makes sense?

"I read this book just after reading 'Train to Pakistan', by Khushwant Singh, which too is a fictional story written against a backdrop of a political crisis of the 1940s. Both the books use descriptive writing to a great extent to present the imagery of different scenes before the reader. And here, the difference could not have been any more pronounced.

I am not mentioning specific examples from 'The Book Thief' to avoid spoilers. You'll have to take my word for it, and those who have already read it would know what I'm saying, the description of the weather is too bizarre at times, and the description of the appearance of the characters is just too repetitive. Several observations by the characters as well as the narrator seem like a failed attempt at being poetic. In contrast to it, 'Train to Pakistan' has an actual poetic description of the weather, the people and their persona.

Then there is the writing style where the author breaks a single sentence into multiple lines. It works during tense situations where it allows you to soak in every aspect of the scene, but that's it. It should not be used beyond that, and certainly not in such an excess as in this book.

What surprised me is that many popular comments on this sub find this particular style 'beautiful'. How does one find such an annoying style beautiful is beyond my understanding. I am going to borrow some lines from a review of Zusak's another book to highlight how disruptive it can become:

""The major problem with this book. 

And there is one. 

Is that it's filled. 

Filled. With {fray sentences.} 

You know. 

Sentences on one line. 

All by themselves. 

To really imbue them with meaning and import.

You know. Meaning and import. 

This book has them.

On every. 

Bloody. 

Page.

And it really cramped my ability to enjoy this book. 

So there. 

There you have it. 

My review. 

Of this book."" (the first review [here](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19057.I_Am_the_Messenger))

However, despite all these flaws, I loved the storyline. The weird similes and metaphors frustrated me at times, but once I decided to just skim over them, the going became much smooth. And yes, the ending was a real tearjerker. I had to remove my glasses as tears would keep dropping onto them. Had this book been shorter, with better descriptive writing, I would have loved it. But since it is a big-ass 600 pages long book, I simply like it and will recommend it to people with good patience who won't mind ignoring the worse parts.",books,2585

"I knew beforehand the book was based on the pitfalls of communism and the basic theme of the book but boy was I in for a surprise. Just 94 pages made it feel like a whole journey and by the time Major was mentioned in the last few pages it really felt that years had passed since the day the animals rebelled against Mr. Jones.

I would like to hear your thoughts on what happened to snowball after he was driven away? I was secretly hoping he would show up in the end to the animal farm's rescue.

Also I was startled at why the animals came forward and pleaded guilty of conspiring with snowball despite knowing they'd be punished by death, maybe it was because they were loyal subjects of napolean who gave their lives for instilling fear among the other animals of conspiring against napolean's reign.

Was the windmill destroyed the first time by the wind or by snowball? How many events where the animal farm was attacked in the middle of the night by snowball were actually true? Did snowball even visit the farm again since he was driven off. Part of me believes he was killed by the dogs the very day he was chased away.

The main conclusion I could derive from all this was that communism can never be a success. In the end it would always turn into a dictatorship which would lead to mass genocide before it's liberation. I would pick capitalism any day over it. I'd rather be a Mollie than a Boxer ;)",books,1412

"So what I said in the title is exactly my internal conflict. I want to read those dark bully/ enemies-to-lovers romance, and I've read a load of them, but they just don't pull me in and I don't feel immersed. Sometimes not even a drop. What I love, or maybe just the concept of it, are the strong heroines and those sexy bad boys. I adore them, but picking up a book and reading the devastating stories? Nope. Another concern of mine is that I can stomach dark twisted stuff but many times in these genres when things get embarrassing for the main character, when I feel bad for her and stuff I just cringe cringe cringe and *skip the parts over.* Which is a lot and pratically the whole book. Like, really. (ps im an avid reader)

A lot of ppl probably hate me now because the angst, frustration, humiliation and stuff the main character is put thru is about the most important, and its addicting. But not for me, tho I want to be. Which is why I hate it but I skip to the ending after reading some mild or steamy parts, and after that the book is destroyed for me and I can't get sucked into and don't know the full extent of *everything*. I guess I just can't stomach stuff after all. Although I never truly get disturbed by the most horrific, sick of the most horrific. Also ppl say you need to read lots of books in diff genres to know more, explore more, so I just read them but never get into them, never breaks my heart, its just like (mostly)the girl gets bullied, though much more complex, she has to stand up, in the end the sexy guy gets her etc and smut. 

I guess I like the concept of it too much... and forcing myself to read it. Perhaps its not my cup of tea, but I feel I can never come to terms with it and i SO *desperately* want to like it. and I can't stop myself. Oh and ppl say they can pick up a book anytime anywhere? It's not for me. All the damn time I have to get myself 'in the mood' (which is very very hard uber hard. maybe like in half a year or something I can only be once 'in a mood' and can fully experience) or I cannot focus at all. And the book gets destroyed for me. It happens a lot, a lot for enemies-to-lovers/ bully romances, but also a lot for all other genres too.

"Do you read books mainly because you enjoy the process of reading itself,

\- especially gaining better understanding of other people, becoming more empathetic

\- better understanding human desires, struggles, dreams, trials and tribulations

\- being able to discuss the book afterwards with my friends

\- getting ideas, being inspired, or even being influenced by the books

\- comparing my life situation with that of the characters, gaining a wider referential system for understanding the world, seeing perspective of others that I can't see in my real life

"It's taken my years to discover the love for reading; I‚Äôve always wanted to read because I liked the idea based on podcasts I listen to f people I look up to who mentioned how much they read.

I‚Äôm 30 years old, and the bug finally bit. I struggled with wanting to read self-help books only; Tim Ferris‚Äô ‚ÄôThe Four Hour Work Week‚Äô, etc.


Then I finally found some fictional books, I fell in love with the following: Paulo Coelho‚Äôs Coelho‚Äôs ‚ÄôThe Alchemist‚Äô then ‚ÄôHippie‚Äô, and I‚Äôm currently busy with Robin Sharma‚Äôs ‚ÄôThe Monk Who Sold His Ferrari.‚Äô

I‚Äôd appreciate any suggestions for books with the same story style which is engrained with the sort of life lessons the mentioned books can deliver.

"With literally every book I've ever read since I was a kid, I've skimmed or outright skipped all descriptive passages that aren't totally necessary to understanding the text.

So, for example, if a character enters some setting and the author spends the next couple paragraphs describing this new place, I'll skim to see if there's anything that might be important to the story and if not I'll just skip to the next piece of dialogue.

I simply don't have the patience to sit through long-winded descriptions, and I'm curious as to whether or not this is something others struggle with.",books,586

From an early age, I was able to pick and choose my own books, find my own interests, and as soon as I was tall enough to reach the counter, have my own library card. I read a ton. The connection between reading and libraries continued as an adult: my first job was as a library shelver, and I still go as often as I can to refresh my reading shelf. I think it's all because my family started with me with reading and libraries early on.

"Probably 3/4 of my books are second hand. Between us, my husband and I own thousands of books. We both love reading, and we both love owning books.

It was my 35th birthday on Wednesday, and my husband gave me copies of: ""The Theban Plays"" by **Sophocles** ; ""The Histories"" by **Herodotus**; and ""The Odyssey"" by **Homer**. 

Probably my favourite part about them all so far, is that each copy came from the local second hand and antique bookstore, and they are all very worn, and very well read, but in good condition. Which is my favourite way to read old books. I love seeing notes people have made in the margins, and creases where people have marked their pages, and all the other little bits and pieces that show somebody else has read this book before me. And I love adding my own little bits and pieces alongside the other notes, just so when I die, hopefully someone new will take ownership of all my old books and carry on adding their thoughts.

I really don't have a lot of information about it, but I really want to find and reread it.  


It's basically about some near future society in which christianity is illegal and almost everyone is a nonbeliever. The pope and bishops and all the rest are forced to resign or imprisoned (or killed?) and christianity is nigh on forgotten. There remains one last believer who remains faithful, and practises secretly. Some special anti-christian agent (i'm not sure) is sent to track the last christian down. They find them, and hold them at gunpoint, ordering them to renounce their faith or die. The Christian drops to their knees and begins to pray. The agent, pulls the trigger and ends his life. The last Christian dies. But, as the agent pulls the trigger, a flicker of doubt crosses their mind: what if the christian is right? what if there is a God who is listening?  


And so another Christian was born.

"I was reading *Finnegans Wake*, and then I came across this line on page 77. It reads:

&gt;the beauchamp, byward, bull and lion, the white, the wardrobe

At first, there seems to be a reference to the novel *The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe* by C.S. Lewis, which is just one out of thousands of allusions to other literature. Obviously, the phrase ""lion, the white, the wardrobe"" uses the word ""white"" to indicate the white witch, Jadis.

However, there is a strange aspect to this quote. The C.S. Lewis novel was first written in 1949 and published in 1950, whereas James Joyce, the author of *Finnegans Wake*, died in 1941. 

Is this reference simply a coincidence, that just happened to unwittingly reference a future book, or do the two novels somehow have a connection?",books,780

""Coffee and Condolences"" is a story about conquering grief and finding love during a time where one might find it possible. This book puts you in the mind of Miles Alexander after a tragic loss in his life. He suffers from anxiety and that's where this book shines. His mind is scattered and he overthinks every situation he finds himself in. I really enjoyed the characters as well. The story revolves around Miles reconnecting with his step sister and their relationship felt real. I will admit that the plot is nothing you haven't read or seen in a movie before but it really doesn't matter because the characterizations are done so well.

"So. I just finished reading Lolita, as the title would imply. I‚Äôve known about it for ages, heard more about it recently, and now I‚Äôve read it.

I don‚Äôt know if I misunderstood the feedback I was hearing or what, however...

I would often hear talk about Humbert Humbert as some relatable, likeable monster. Oh yes, the things he was doing were monstrous, but what made the book so fascinating is that Nabokov wrote such an evil character in such a likeable, perhaps even sympathetic fashion!

I really didn‚Äôt see this. I found Humbert to be obnoxious, egotistical and generally unlikeable. That‚Äôs not even in regards to his relationship with Dolores.

I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a single character he encountered, besides Dolores, who doesn‚Äôt cause his internal monologue to sink into some pompous identification and judgement of their character flaws. 

The man‚Äôs internal monologue, and thus the narrative of the book, seems to alternate between swooning over Dolores, plotting violence or manipulation against those he thinks are going to take her from him (Or her, as she gets older and he fears she is planning to run away, all while he plans to flee the country with her, have children, and thus ‚Äòreplacement nymphettes‚Äô as she grows too old. That was probably the most disturbing moment in his internal monologue. His dream of having daughters and granddaughters who would act as his stream of renewable victims as they became too old for his tastes.) and long-winded diatribes about all the reasons he despises these various yokels, idiots, and generally boorish people he meets.

What do people find so compelling or interesting or sympathetic about him? That the narrative has become one of this wonderfully charming, likeable man narrating all these awful things he is doing?

I did not find Humbert likeable in the slightest. I found him to be an incredibly unlikeable, smug egotist. Independent of his taste in women.",books,1926

"I finally read this book after having it in the back of my mind as one of the books that was assigned to other kids and not me in Elementary School. After that, I never heard anyone talk about it. 

I‚Äôve been reading a lot lately, and buying big stacks from Thrift Stores. Thought I‚Äôd give it a shot because it was short, probably light, and something that has always felt ‚Äúunread‚Äù to me. Beckoning to me. 

I was floored. This book is incredible. One-sitting, a couple hours, and I looked up and was not the same as I was when I first looked down. I was expecting something very childish, but this is a real dystopian story that follows a boy I‚Äôd describe as a hero. It is a more accessible, less ‚Äúfantastical‚Äù version of the Neverending Story in its theme, it‚Äôs got a dash of Fahrenheit 451 which has always been a favorite, and I‚Äôm seriously peeved I didn‚Äôt read it as a kid but extremely glad I finally made the decision as an adult. 

If you haven‚Äôt read it, read it. Beautiful, beautiful story, deserving of all its acclaim. If I was an English teacher I‚Äôd be psyched, knowing this book existed. It teaches every literary device. Need to show someone Imagery? The whole book is about appreciating real imagery, and the words you use to describe it. Need characterization, static vs dynamic, need symbolism, need foreshadowing? It‚Äôs all there and some of it even defines itself. 

Dark, too. Surprising, poetic delivery of some very disturbing scenes. I almost can‚Äôt appreciate a book unless there‚Äôs an element of darkness and this satisfied.

"I'd never even heard of this book, it's so overshadowed by some of Dumas's other works. But I had to read it as soon as I learned about it- an imprisoned man on a mad quest to grow the world's first fully black tulip, his only aide the daughter of the jailor who keeps him captive. I found a copy on Kobo for only 89 cents so I jumped right in. And let me tell you, I loved it.

The book is so much better than even the description leads you to think. First of all, it's hilarious. The tone of The Black Tulip reminds my of a Wes Anderson or Yorgos Lathimos film. The dramatic irony, the offhand comments, the meaningful names (this tulip-fancier is helped by characters named Rosa and Orange). I love how many times Rosa brought up, very matter of fact and casually, how she was not able to read, until she had to outright tell the main character to teach her how. The book maintains a tone of light, not quite dry comedy that's very effective. It's just delightful. Secondly, the book pulled me in with some surprisingly tense scenes at the beginning. There are prison escapes, beatings, flight from angry mobs, executions, people being torn apart by other people, political intrigue, a scheming prince. There is so much danger and uncertainty, and a lot of it stems purely from the obsessions of tulip growers. And like many classics written so long ago, the format of the book doesn't follow ones we're familiar with today, so it was pretty hard to tell what was going to happen next in the story. Lots of little surprises. 

I haven't read anything else by Dumas, but I am much more excited to read Monte Cristo now after having loved The Black Tulip so much. This guy has a way with writing.",books,1697

The evocative descriptions of the Alaskan wild and of the toil of travelling, paired with Buck's - the dog protagonist of the story - transformation from domesticated house pet to wild beast, and his eventual inner conflict as he wrestles between the lure of the wild and of his ties to human kind, make for some of the most incredible writing I have ever read.

"Here's a look at how reading in VR looks like: https://i.imgur.com/TfKMbLF.mp4

Been wanting a dedicated Kindle reader in my Oculus Quest, but I recently discovered that the browser in it can do Desktop Mode. So with that, I logged in to the cloud reader, and here I am.

I can finally read lying down on bed without my arms getting tired holding it up over my head (and risking it falling on my face). The hand-tracking capability is also great since I don't have to use my controller. 

Also, I feel more focused in this space since all distracting elements in my real environment is gone. Think of it as a virtual reading room. I have Spotify on another window, streaming music to set up the mood, and a dictionary for those words I'm not familiar with (the highlighting function isn't working currently; makes me a sad panda). 

Problem, however, is the coffee/tea game. You can fix that with a straw.

"First off, it's a classic Vampire horror story. It's also considered the FIRST and is many years senior to Bram Stoker's Dracula. And I'd actually go so far as to say it was superior in characters. Carmilla specifically displays a manipulative nature and the details of that manipulative nature are so excellently portrayed. And as far as particular traits of the character being showcased and genuine reactions, Carmilla beats Dracula. In my opinion, Dracula was more emotionless. I never found his character very interesting. At least not any more interesting than watching paint dry.

I absolutely suggest you all read Carmilla. The only downside is the ending comes out of nowhere and it feels rushed at the end.",books,716
"My god! I just watched the film. Outstanding, phenemomal, mindbending, amazingly confusing, creative...i could go on! Charlie Kaufman's direction really brought this film to life by using the source  material well and creating a piece of art out of it. Do yourself a favor and watch it. Its on netflix now. 

I went on a bit tangent but I'm here to discuss the book. When i started reading the book last year, I expected it to just be a horror novel. But it is so much more than that. It is a psychological/philosophical horror/thriller and I'm sure it can be categorised into more subgenres. It was an unsettling experience reading it to say the least. The long monologues representing important themes such as loneliness and existentialism were enlightening and captivating. The subtle horror and mystique magnified the suspense and kept me at the edge of my seat. And the reveal at the end...initially made me perplexed but after doing research on what it meant and read the book a second time, it really left me in awe of what it all meant. 

This book is polarizing, I know. You either on the South Pole of dislike or at the North Pole of amazement. Either way, it cannot be denied that the novel was unique and fascinating. It was one of the more memorable books I've read last year.  

I recommend it to all who have not read!

"I love Don DeLillo. I‚Äôve read his big four novels from the mid ‚Äò80s to the late ‚Äò90s, Zero K, and The Angel Esmerelda. One reason I think Don DeLillo is so great is because he‚Äôs so crystal clear in his prose. Without sacrificing complexity, ambiguity and his top-notch diction, DeLillo writes in a way that engages the reader rather than trying to surprise or confuse him without any kind of over-the-top flourish. I even recall someone say that he attempts to delight the reader, and I believe it. He does it in a way that people like Pynchon just does not do for me in The Crying of Lot 49. (I bring up Pynchon as DeLillo is so often compared with him.) Nonetheless, DeLillo‚Äôs work is so thematically complex, I almost always hit JSTOR to read some lit journals to help me get a more theoretical understanding of what I‚Äôve just read. 

And so a few days ago, after finishing Cosmopolis, I found that there is almost no literary criticism on the novel. Has anyone else noticed this, or is there anyone who can point me in the direction toward some? 

I was pleasantly surprised by Cosmopolis. I‚Äôve heard it said that it‚Äôs a lesser novel of his. While it might not have been as ambitious as, say, Libra or Underworld, it was still an impressively grand novel for the small space and time that it took up and the quick read that it was.

I've been trying to find a good first edition copy to surprise her with for her birthday, after searching through countless sites showing first editions I'm still no closer to selecting the book. 

I've been looking at the below, however how do I know of it's a good buy etc? I don't want to break the bank, but I'd like a rare enough copy that it'll be really special for her.

"So I just finished this book a couple of minutes ago and I realise that the narrator, the janitor and Jake are the same person. Jake suffers from either schizophrenia or Multiple Personality Disorder (they might be the same thing?) and in the end he kills himself.

Now the bits between chapters the two unnamed people discussing the death, at the end they say read it backwards which I understand is for the reader to re-read the book but backwards.

This is pretty dumb but does that mean to read Chapter 13 first, then 12, 11, 10 etc? and not literally read it backwards.",books,574
"I'm obviously not alone in rereading plenty of books, but am I alone in finding it really strange growing older when the characters stay the same? 

Rereading at 33 something I first read at 12 and suddenly I'm the same age as the parents in that book instead of the kids. How did *that* happen? They seemed monstrously old back then. I reread *The Stand* a few months back and was shocked the find a main character who I still think of as much older than me is actually younger. 

The one I keep coming back to is *David Copperfield*, one of the greatest books ever written about growing up. I first read that at 17 and felt so close to the main character when he's that age. I read it now and it's the oddest sense of nostalgia reacting to that same character as a 33 year old. Makes me wonder how I'll react in another 15 years or so. 

Anyone else find this? I'm guessing the classic example would be Holden Caulfield from *The Catcher in the Rye.*",books,952
"This year marks 100 years since the publication of Edith Wharton's classic novel, **The Age of Innocence**. If you have never read her work before, this is not only a great excuse to dip your toe in the water, but is also a perfect book with which to start. Exploring the tight, rigid social codes amongst the New York super rich-in the early 20th century, **The Age of Innocence** follows the story of Newland Archer, his fianc√© May Welland, and what happens when May's cousin, Countess Olenska, scandalously returns to Manhattan after leaving her violent husband. Wharton's writing is beautiful and often fun and bitchy. This is a remarkably repressed society, similar to that in the world Jane Austen depicted many years earlier, in which so much is felt but so little can be publicly expressed. As Wharton herself puts it: 

""The persons of their world lived in an atmosphere of faint implications and pale delicacies.""

If you enjoy reading social comedy, and enjoy writers like Jane Austen, Oscar Wilde or early Henry James, you are guaranteed to enjoy this book. Other novels by Wharton well worth reading include **The House of Mirth** and **The Custom of the Country**.",books,1178
"Hello!  
I hope this is allowed here.  
I decided to take on a huge project. It has blossomed as I get deeper and deeper(as these things tend to do) and the best way i can describe it is I am looking to sort/catagorize/make easily accessible/whatever a list of authors that have inspired songs/musicians. Currently focusing on direct quotes/interpretations of authors. It is organized by author-genre-musician-song titles.  
I am getting a bit lost in the project and was hoping for some feedback to keep the momentum of my end goal. I have yet to find a complete or comprehensive list SPECIFICALLY about music and literature.  
SO I decided to make one.

Anyway, here's the idea

"As I wait for my next amazon order, I ended up perusing my family bookshelf and came upon Kidnapped, by R.L. Stevenson. I devoured it instantly. 

I was amazed that such a book is referred to as a children‚Äôs classic, yet as a work published so long ago it carries the tropes of appealing to youth through the young protagonist of David Balfour, yet also caters to the wits of adults with matters such as wordplay and discussion of political alignment. 

However, what stuck with me the most in regards to the work was the way in which the discussion of ‚ÄúWhigs‚Äù and ‚ÄúJacobites‚Äù was raised. Despite coming from different sides of an opposing revolution, both David and his friend Alan Breck look past their differences in a way that is not generally seen in many of today‚Äôs works. That is, neither one ends the story having woken to the other‚Äôs ideal, yet find the value of friendship with one another and the ways in which members of different ideals can still share niceties and act towards a common goal. 

When the story reached its peak of emotional tension between the protagonists, Stevenson creates a sudden shift in which political affiliation is cast aside to be replaced instead by two individuals who find comfort in one another‚Äôs company.

All the while, the story itself illustrates the way in which underlying political affiliation can create rifts between people of common interests and shared experiences, often times resulting in conflict where conflict can be avoided. The instance of Alan and Robin casting swords aside to play the pipes in lieu of maiming brings to light the way in which both characters immediately de-escalate from political affiliation in order to share in a common endeavour, and leave better men because of it. 

I regret that I didn‚Äôt find this book sooner, as reading it has caused me to consider my own affiliations and value as a person, as well as the value of my friendships outside of what drives people apart and more about what brings us together.",books,1997

"To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee

In my opinion the first part was very boring and slow and it took awhile for the plot to come along the book. The first part shows who the kids are and the small town they live in and how racism is playing a big part. Then when I got to part two of the book and it started to get interesting and showed the character development that Jem and Scout had while discovering what their town in actually like. 

My favorite part was when Atticus asked Scout who she though saved her life and she said it was Boo Radley and he was in the room at the moment. 
Empathy plays a big role in the book and so does racism. In my opinion Tom Robinson represents the mockingbird because he‚Äôs very nice and a fragile person.

My boyfriend pointed out that it was uncomfortable and weird to have a bunch of nazi books and that it could give a weird impression to visitors who see the collection on the book shelf.

"This got kicked off by thelonecaner after [I asked what the deal was with Habitation Velier](https://en.reddit.com/r/rum/comments/ifwac2/can_someone_eli5_those_habitation_velier_rums/), and he wrote [a wonderful article ](http://thelonecaner.com/key-rums-of-the-world-habitation-velier/) after many of you linked [his historical posts about IBs](http://thelonecaner.com/the-age-of-veliers-demeraras-part-1/). Since the book mentioned in those posts and caught my interest I picked it up. Here's what he had to say about the book. 

&gt; Released in 1995, Ed Hamilton‚Äôs book ‚ÄúRums of the Eastern Caribbean‚Äù was a rich and varied survey of as many distilleries and rums as Mr. Hamilton found the time to visit and try over many years of sailing around the Caribbean.  Because of its limited focus, it lacked a global perspective, but it was a treasure trove of information of the rum producing world in the eastern Caribbean at that time, it was based on solid first hand experience, and many rum junkies who make distillery trips part of their overall rum education are treading in his footsteps. If nothing else, it elevated the knowledge of the curious and made it clear that there was an enormous breadth in rums, so much so that historical info aside, anyone could find something to please themselves. (It was followed up in 1997 by another book called ‚ÄúThe Complete Guide to Rum‚Äù).

"Hi everyone,

I have a challenge for you. For some time now (I'm not sure how it started) I have been comparing in my mind the aesthetics, subject matters and styles of books to those of paintings or other forms of art, such as movies and photographs.

For example, the aesthetic and subject matter of Cormac McCarthy‚Äôs writing (especially Blood Meridian) remind me a lot of Boschs paintings of hell and apocalypse, and I know that is a comparison that has been made by others. It is this feverish, borderline surreal, spiritual and dark atmosphere with all its anarchic and apocalyptic scenarios that I find in both, McCarthy‚Äôs novels and Bosch‚Äôs paintings. Similarly, the prose of G√ºnter Grass (especially The Tin Drum) always reminds me of Bruegel‚Äôs paintings, with their depictions of peasants and fools. (His paintings always bring to mind books by Rabelais and similar authors as well.)

I could go on. David Lynch‚Äôs movies remind me of Kafka for obvious reasons, also of Nabokov‚Äôs Lolita and the works of Kobo Abe. The paintings of Frida Kahlo: Garc√≠a M√°rquez, not (solely) because of their Latin American heritage, but because of the mix of realism and surrealism, the cultural aspects of their surrealism etc.

What else. Francis Bacon = William S. Burroughs and Thomas Ligotti; Max Ernst = (again, for obvious reasons) J.G. Ballard; Otto Dix = Kafka, Alfred D√∂blin, maybe even DeLillo (?).

What paintings remind you ‚Äì in terms of aesthetics, subject matter, etc. ‚Äì of works of literature, and vice versa? Feel free to use the painters I have mentioned above.

"&gt;!I like to reflect on books after finishing them, and there's certain no shortage of that in DADoES. One element that I hadn't seen discussed before was when Rick is buying his goat, and the pet store asks him if he'll be making an exchange. Humans are obsessed with displaying empathy and getting rid of an animal to ""upgrade"" flies in direct face of that. The ""humanity"" theme is touched on in other plots, but it seems like this simple exchange goes unnoticed.

Second, it bugs me how open-ended or unexplored plot elements are in Philip K Dick's work (at least based on DADoES and Ubik). When they end...they don't really end. And I don't mean that in ""let me dwell on this for months"" manner. While I liked both DADoES and Ubik overall, their endings left me wanting. For example, the fake police station is great in the moment, but it doesn't mesh well with the ending. PKD purposefully avoids ""testing"" Rick as an android (either through the other bounty hunter or having him visit his police station) to add to the ""perceived reality"" theme, but in the story's context, these seem unlikely non-occurrences. IMO - his commitment to themes degrades the quality of the actual stories and thus fails to cement the themes as strongly as he probably wished. !&lt;",books,1269

"Hi everyone I've just discovered Hemingway and read several of his novels during quarantine, yesterday I finished Farewell to Arms and I'm a little confused at the point of the ending.

&amp;#x200B;

That is, what was Hemingway's message in having Catherine and the baby die? 

&amp;#x200B;

I was very surprised to see that Catherine was drinking during her pregnancy, and drinking *on purpose* because ""the doctor said it would make the baby small"".  So that means at the time of writing there *was* a medical understanding that drinking while pregnant is dangerous.  So at first I thought the baby's death had to do with her drinking, but then I was questioning whether people knew how harmful that was.  But then like I said her doctor comments on it and besides humans have been having babies and drinking alcohol forever so we had to know something was not good.

&amp;#x200B;

I brought this up to a friend and they said ""it's mean girls, if you have sex you'll get pregnant and you'll die."" I laughed but then realized well, Catherine's sister is so ashamed of her ""whore"" sister so maybe there is something of a morality tale in it?  But then that's not Hemingway's style by any means.

&amp;#x200B;

I know the conventional wisdom is ""it's about the random, arbitrary nature of life, the pointlessness of it all"" that everything sucks then we die but that's not what I felt while reading at all.

"I don't remember the title but I remember it was quite a thick book with a orange cover of a sunset. It was a non fiction novel about America during the time of Jim Crow laws.

Now, I've read some pretty dark stuff and am quite mature (I'm 19) and have read and seen really explicit content. However, for some reason, there was a scene in this book that almost made me throw up.

In the book it was talking about why one black man who was required to join the army, refuses to do so and hated all white people. He then went through a flashback about his childhood. The fate of his parents were already spoken about really early in the book so it's not a spoiler.

His family was wealthy for a African American, one time his dad bought a large pig and everyone wanted it. A white neighbor then kept pestering his dad for the pig and his dad refused. Finally that neighbor was furious that he was being refused by a black man and decided to pay his dad a visit at night.

The man was 9 years old at the time and had a little sister, that night the white man led a crowd to visit their house and drag his mom and dad outside. They then cut the fingers off the dad and his ear, they also raped the mom, they then lynched them and lit their bodies on fire while they were still alive.

The man, again he was 9 years old, watched everything from the window. The police even kept his dads finger in a jar as they don't care about black people.

I actually skimmed this passage as it was just too much for me. I felt light-headed for some reason even though I knew it was just a book.

I just knew that this probably has happened to countless people in real life.",books,1655
"My reading comprehension is really bad. I can read fast if I want to, but it's like I can't process the text fast enough and it becomes just a text without any meaning. Even if I read slow, I easily get distracted and have to re-read the text. Sometimes I can't seem to refocus easily and can spend like 5 second trying to understand a simple sentence because I am thinking about other stuff (like if I'm reading good or not). I'm not native English speaker and I have more problems with English reading than I have with reading in my native language. I also have problems with remembering the information from the text. Is there a possibility that I can get better at comprehension speed and remembering if I'll read more?

"Spoilers below

I've read a decent amount of books but pretty much all fiction and I can confidently say that the ID trilogy is my favorite series EVER. What's funny is that it's a prequel for the Mortal Instruments series and the MI series should be read first (from what I've heard) and then read the ID trilogy which is also the order of which they were released.

I actually read the ID trilogy first and it was the best decision I've ever made. Not to say that the MI series was bad, it was good with a amazing villain (that Sebastian guy), but it got really weird with the incest, not incest, thing that completely threw me off. I didn't even finish that series, I stopped in the last two books.

With ID, it's just the characters that carry the series. It's sooo good. I don't quite remember as I've read it 4 years ago but the thing with Jem and his story with the demons, and then there was Will and Tessa. It was just amazing! Especially with the ending. The time skip epilogue where Tessa and Jem meet again in present day on the bridge.

That was probably the most perfect ending I have ever read.",books,1109

"Hi everyone,

I have a challenge for you. For some time now (I'm not sure how it started) I have been comparing in my mind the aesthetics, subject matters and styles of books to those of paintings or other forms of art, such as movies and photographs.

For example, the aesthetic and subject matter of Cormac McCarthy‚Äôs writing (especially Blood Meridian) reminds me a lot of Boschs paintings of hell and apocalypse, and I know that is a comparison that has been made by others. It is this feverish, borderline surreal, spiritual and dark atmosphere with all its anarchic and apocalyptic scenarios that I find in both, McCarthy‚Äôs novels and Bosch‚Äôs paintings. Similarly, the prose of G√ºnter Grass (especially The Tin Drum) always reminds me of Bruegel‚Äôs paintings, with their depictions of peasants and fools. (His paintings always bring to mind books by Rabelais and similar authors as well.)

I could go on. David Lynch‚Äôs movies remind me of Kafka for obvious reasons, also of Nabokov‚Äôs Lolita and the works of Kobo Abe. The paintings of Frida Kahlo: Garc√≠a M√°rquez, not (solely) because of their Latin American heritage, but because of the mix of realism and surrealism, the cultural aspects of their surrealism etc.

What else. Francis Bacon ‚Äì William S. Burroughs, Thomas Ligotti; Max Ernst ‚Äì (again, for obvious reasons) J.G. Ballard; Otto Dix ‚Äì Kafka, Alfred D√∂blin (?).

So. My challenge for you is to think of  intermedial connections between painters, filmmakers, photographers and writers. What paintings remind you ‚Äì in terms of aesthetics, subject matter, etc. ‚Äì works of literature, and vice versa? Feel free to use the painters I have mentioned above. Are the authors or books that remind you of the works of

Francisco de Goya (him I wonder especially about);

Van Gogh;

Francis Bacon;

Frida Kahlo?

Or others? Do you get what I mean? Let me know what you think.",books,1880

"Is the writing style of the way of the kings different from that of the Mistborn series ?  
Sanderson seems to be writing an epic here so that makes me wonder (and has me worried ) whether I will enjoy it . Did enjoy Mistborn a lot .

The writing for mistborn was simple and easy english . Nothing flamboyant but he still got the emotions through . Very approachable . I wouldnt mind a little more flamboyance in his writing if he does it well. But Just throught I would like to know beforehand what the writing style is . Something I just prefer to know. 

Anyone else has this habit ?

"I picked up a copy of this book after it was suggested in the book suggestions sub and I couldn't put it down. I finished the whole book in two sittings and the range of emotions I felt while reading it was vast.

My sister passed away a few months ago. She was sick for a long time but the doctors kept telling her that there was hope for her to get a transplant. Even long after they knew she wasn't going to get one they kept telling her she might which kept her hopes up. Eventually they told her the truth, that she was never going to get a transplant. She passed away shortly after that but didn't have the time to finish her will or say goodbye to everyone like she had wanted to. I'm still angry at the doctors for not being honest with her and allowing her that time to finish things, had they just told her the truth from the beginning she might have had time to wrap things up the way she was planning to. Instead she just waited and was hopeful putting things off expecting her to have more time.

I think that's one of the reasons this book was so powerful for me. A story around giving people the chance to say goodbye before they die. Watching the main characters learning to love life and appreciate it for all its beauty while knowing that they won't last till the end of the day was heart-wrenching and beautiful. I haven't read a book that made me feel so deeply in a long time.",books,1397

"I know this sounds like a dumb question but I'm having a hard time understanding what he means by 'prejudice' where he uses it, like its general meaning doesn't seem to fit the context it's used in, for example:

"".....You throw a man off! I won‚Äôt go to the memorial meal, but it‚Äôs not on account of that trouble; I won‚Äôt go on principle, so as not to participate in the vile prejudice of such a meal, that‚Äôs why! However, it would even be possible to go, just like that, to laugh¬†.¬†.¬†. A pity there won‚Äôt be any priests. Otherwise, I‚Äôd certainly go.""

What are the ""prejudices of such a meal""? Is it because it's a memorial meal thus it has something do with religion which he (this character) is against? 

Another example is here:

"".....Didn‚Äôt they accuse Terebyeva at first (the one who is now in a commune) because, when she walked out on her family and¬†.¬†.¬†. gave herself, she wrote to her mother and father that she did not want to live among prejudices and was entering into a civil marriage, and it was supposedly all too rude‚Äîtowards fathers, that is‚Äîand she could have spared them and written more gently?""

"In my teens (in the 80's) I was a fairly voracious reader. Mostly Stephen King and that sort of thing, but it helped steer me clear of other troubles I could have gotten into. I remember reading this one book, though. It wasn't a *great* book, but something about it has stuck with me through the years. I've often tried to recall the title or the author, but I've never been able to crack it.

All I can remember is, it's about a ""fixer"" who helps people when the law can't. He got his start as a teenager when one of his elderly neighbors kept getting his mailbox run over. He filled a steel pipe with cement, put that into a cement-filled hole, mounted the mailbox on top, and you know the rest. Then there was something about a supernatural curse-being hunting someone down (can't remember if it was the Fixer dude or a client, but whatever.) As I said, not a great book, but I remember reading it more than once, before forgetting about it in my early 20s.

For years (in fact, nearly 3 decades) I've tried to recall the name of this book. Today, I saw a post on Reddit along the lines of ""Name a book you loved, and a book you hated, but don't tell me which is which."" I started thinking about *that book* again, when out of the blue, it hit me.

*The Tomb,* by F. Paul Wilson (I had to look up the author.)

"I just said English in the title but you're also welcome to comment if you're a native English speaker who primarily reads in another language. 

I'm a native Turkish speaker living in the UK the past 6 years. I'm also a lapsed bookworm trying to get back into reading. I'm mostly reading British literature nowadays because it's much easier to get my hands on it here and I find it intriguing due to the novelty. Compared to reading in my native language, I read a bit more slowly in English, but I'm a slow reader in general - I read 20-25 pages per hour in Turkish and around 15-20 pages in English.

When I see an unfamiliar word in Turkish, I can usually infer the meaning from context, or just have a passive understanding of it even though I'd never use it myself in conversation, although my Turkish vocabulary has been waning due to living abroad for several years. I can do the same in English too, but to a lesser extent. Even if I can get the meaning from context, I don't feel as confident about it so I end up looking it up anyway. I get particularly stuck in descriptive passages where I may encounter 4+ unfamiliar words in one sentence, one after another.

I'm quite strict about reading in the original language if I can, but recently I found myself wondering whether I'd prefer to read the Turkish or English translation of a book written in a third language (e.g. Spanish or Russian). It would make more sense to read it in my native language, but that would also make it more difficult to critique the book with my English speaking friends online or in real life. Also Turkish is vastly different to European languages in terms of grammar and vocabulary, so I feel like more things may get lost in translation.

"I just reached the halfway point of this book and to be honest I really wanted to like it but i just can‚Äôt at all. It‚Äôs taken literally months just to read these past 200 pages and it just DRAGS. 

i don‚Äôt even know what‚Äôs going on most of the time and it feels like alternating between watching paint dry, trying to fall asleep, and sitting at the DMV. i knew going in that it is not the most chronological book ever (that‚Äôs never been an issue for me before), but the problem for me is this one feels pointless and meandering with no message, purpose, or even an end in sight.

I‚Äôve never before thought 200 pages felt this long, the stretch to the end feels insurmountable. I started it a while ago and feel like i‚Äôve been wading through never-ending disorganized heaps of rambling, self-indulgent lyrical fancies that are meant to sound poetic but just never seem to achieve anything. To me reading this feels like flipping through someone‚Äôs journal which is just a jumbled mess of nonsensical thoughts with a pretty turn of phrase every now and then. I want to finish the book but I dread picking it up each time, i can only get through a few pages at a time before i have to stop out of boredom.

In my opinion the plot is lethargic and the characters dull and one-dimensional. I don‚Äôt need fictional characters to be ‚Äúmorally good‚Äù to be worth reading but i just don‚Äôt find these interesting or well-developed in the least. I know he tends to write fictionalized versions of himself and his wife but because i (like most of the world‚Äôs population) have no personal attachment to either of the fitzgeralds i don‚Äôt see why i should care about their fictional selves either. the book is also not subtle in its inclusion of casually racist and misogynist language, but fine we can chalk it up to the time period. There‚Äôs so much more here to dismantle. 

Also one of my main languages is french and i find the random interspersed french phrases in the book just kind of silly and unnecessary, like those kids in college who have to remind you every two seconds that they studied abroad. The european settings don‚Äôt add anything to the plot (if there even is one) other than a pretentious dash of worldly spice. I just don‚Äôt even know what the point of this whole book is lol. It seems to have good reviews but i‚Äôm not sure if perhaps this is affected by the reputation of the author. 

All in all it‚Äôs just really not my cup of tea. i just can‚Äôt get into the story at all and have disliked every second of my reading experience, though mostly the plot and the writing style (even tho he is literally known for being good at prose lmao) and I usually do not have such strong feelings (either positive or negative) about any book, but I can‚Äôt find a single thing to like about this one lol...

And i mostly agree with all of these things, except the last part.
Even on the third book, i still find it hard to read Tolkien's writing.

Yet I still felt like I have read a lot of fantasy but this is still the hardest for me. Reading A Game of Thrones felt easier in comparison.

"Since I could read, I've read exclusively fiction books. I've always compared non-fiction books with textbooks or reference type books, and could never really get into them or keep an interest. 

But since starting to listen to the Joe Rogan podcast, I've been really interested in anthropology books by Graham Hancock and Randal Carlson. I read America Before by Graham Hancock and found it super interesting and probably the first non-fiction book I've read in my life. I just started Sapiens by  Yuval Noah Harari  and I again find myself enthralled by the subject matter. 

I guess it takes that one niche topic to pique an interest. 

I'm still doing to read fiction books though, I just finished Dune and am hoping to start the sequel soon.",books,746
"Hey folks. After listening to the Too Much and Never Enough audiobook, I have to say it is one of the most intense non-fiction books I ever stumbled upon. Raw and to the point in regards to how Mary describes the awful childhood her dad and Donald, her uncle, went through that took away her dad's life and dreams and damaged the psyche of her infamous uncle. With that said, how would you guys envision a movie based on that book? To me, I imagine it more of a documentary with Mary as the star of the show where she sits and talks about everything from her perspective, along with clips of Trump's life before &amp; after his presidency, as well as interviewing former employees and even former Trump supporters, explaining why they dropped their support. What do you think? How would Mary's book work as a movie?",books,815

"So 1984 is pretty much the dystopian work that inspires other dystopian works. But the problem is that it was written by a cishet white male Englishman in 1949 as a treatise against Stalinism. Because of this, oppression in Oceania is purely based on class struggle, the party has abandoned prejudice and oppresses everyone to some degree or another, even promoting to the inner party based on ideological rather than racial purity. As such, everyone can see themselves as Winston Smith fighting against a corrupt regime, but never admit that they and a lot of people would happily be O'Brien if it meant getting rid of the Muslims or banning gay marriage. I want to know if there are any dystopian works like 1984, but acknowledge that the oppressive regime freely creates, embraces and exacerbates every prejudice they can think of to keep the members of the lower class divided and fighting not for liberation, but to become the oppressors themselves.",books,954

"I'll try to keep this short, even though I could never fall short of words for the masterpiece that is The Man Called Ove, a book that someone on this subreddit sugessted to me. 

One might think, why is the story of an old man with childlike tantrums and zero tolerance so enticing to someone who has significantly better content to go through, especially at this particular point of time. Well, I surprised myself when I started reading this book and stumbled upon an enigma of emotions, both melancholic and cheerfulness but nonetheless equally heartwarming. Every couple of paragraphs, I paused to laugh or I paused to resort to a state that was very close to sobbing. This was particularly difficult to manage, especially when I was reading it in a public place. I messaged one of my friends, saying ""This book is making me do weird things"", and when he replied with ""What's the book about?"", I said, ""It's the story of a man with superficial hate for everyone yet an equally vast ocean of compassion, empathy and love inside him."" Well, this particular friend says ""Wow, he must have been treated unfairly before,"" and he was absolutely spot on. I really don't want to divulge any spoilers here in case anyone decides to read this piece of fiction, but if you can get your hands on it (Just ping me otherwise), lose yourself in it. I promise you, by the end of the book, you'll be crying like an estranged soul and laughing like a free one.

"I am not a fan of books being made into movies since I strongly believe that a book cannot be effectively presented in a span of 2-3 hours. But recently, I watched two limited series based on novels - Alias Grace by Margaret Atwood and The Night Manager by John le Carr√©. The stories are amazing and since both series have six episodes, there is sufficient time to incorporate the major elements of the book, build characters and not rush the plot. The concept doesn't drive me to the point that I will prefer watching the series than reading the book, but the pleasure I've had after watching this is similar to the one I get after reading. Ofcourse the credit goes to some great acting and good direction, but I will want to explore more short series based on books.",books,768

"I think I've finally reached the point where YA isn't enough anymore. I just finished reading Serpent and Dove (great book btw) and I was thinking what to dive into next when I realized that all of my books are the same. I was just staring at my bookshelf there were very few that weren't about romance in one way or another.


And don't get me wrong, romance is fine, but I'm kinda sick of that being *it*


Like, where are all the books with female protagonists that don't have any romance in it, just the FL just being a badass. Maybe taking over a country, becoming the most powerful magic user in existence, or slowly getting revenge against her enemies one idiot at a time.


Too many have I read where the ML is the real power behind the female, or there's a love triangle, or she has to choose between her boyfriend and the world, LIKE ITS A HARD DECISION.( I get why it would be sad and all, but I'm sick of ""there must be another way"" and even worse, when she actually chooses the guy over releasing a terrible evil on the planet)


Does anyone know what I'm talking about? Any suggestions for books where the FL can just be badass, and maybe evil, or at the very least powerful without being a Mary Sue?
 Like, bring on the characters that are okay with killing their enemies, and who dont spend arduous amounts of time playing dress up. (A trend I'm seeing more and more often in YA novels üò≠)

I loved reading as a kid/teen, but high school English was horrible. I just hated EVERY SINGLE book we had to read. The stories are boring, unrelatable and just not engagingly written.

"*Skip to the last paragraph for a ""TL;DR ""*

Over the past six years, I hardly read for fun, which was contrary how it used to be. I have a lot of memories as a child of devouring books. Once when I was real young, I rented 14 books from the library when my parents went on vacation for a week and I was staying home with a sitter, and I finished the majority of them by day 4.

I stopped reading for a lot of reasons Part of it was due to college--lots of people, activities, and I had access to actual internet and had no one shaming me for bumming around and playing video games for the first time in my life. Part of it was due to losing all desire to read for fun. I specialized in English and read a ton for courses anyways, and I was always surrounded by narratives, so while it didn't scratch the itch, it numbed it, especially when I had to read a YA novel a week for one literature course (woof).

The final two reasons were the biggest. One, I had lost all stamina for reading. My attention span couldn't last (probably in part due to media/gaming) and I no longer found books interesting, which I later discovered was because my tastes had changed but I didn't know that at the time. Throughout all of this, I missed reading all of the time even though I still collected books. The other reason was that I struggled a lot with depression and anger, something that undeniably showed its face after a breakup with a long time girlfriend, realizing how few of my friends actually cared about me as a person, leaving a ~~lowkey cult~~ club that I'd been in for years, and struggles with my faith and family.

When I got my first apartment on my own, I started reading again because I told myself I would, finishing up a few half-finished books and trying to read some of the ones I'd collected over the years. As I started reading more, I decided to keep a journal to start recording ever book I read from that day forward so I can look back on it and say, 'Hey, I remember that!'

Now, a year later, I've read 28 books, and am about to finish one by the end of the week! It's taken a lot of discipline, but I've remembered how much books have made me who I am, and how they have been some of the most influential actors in my life. I've come across some of the most beautiful writing I've ever read in this last year, and have had a lot of opinions refined, changed, or developed in the first place thanks to these books. I think the most surreal thing is that I can look back on those books and remember what I was going through at that time, and that I can practically measure my year out with the books I've read. 

It's good to be back, and feel free to share your reading experience or ask any questions!",books,2718

"Now I want to preface this by saying that this was my first time reading this particular Phillip K Dick novel. I enjoy a lot of his other works, they are beautifully off putting and thought provoking.

I would also like to say that, I really enjoyed the story. Setting, social values, characters, and morality were all uniquely presented and were well executed. I can see why this became so popular, and I have nothing against this novel.

What I don‚Äôt get is what happened after Rick retires the Battys, when he drives out to Oregon and ‚Äòfuses‚Äô with Mercer permanently?

Did Rick lose his mind? Did he become a special like John Isidore, as he briefly suspects? Or did he actually take on the role of Mercer in his climb? Does this mean that Mercerism isn‚Äôt entirely fabricated?

"It was definitely the most heartbreakingly beautiful book I have read so far this year. The writing was beautiful and intense. At certain parts it devastated me, made me ugly cry and at other parts made me feel hopeful. Barely 130 pages long and within that small time I felt like I knew the characters inside out, as if I've lived both their lives; felt their love, transformation, revelations, fears, fury, loss, gain everything. I've rarely ever felt so attached to any other character in any book as much as I've done to these two. The setting, mechanisms of this world and the time travelling aspect was unlike anything I've ever read before and it was perfectly executed. There are certain stories that hit you in a completely different way and take the special place in your heart that's above any criticism, character analysis, any of those things.

"I've taken an interest in the relationship between dreaming, desiring, and literature, and I've been trying to make sense of, and organize in my mind, the complex relationships between these artistic and experiential forms. 

In the process, I've been thinking and rethinking about what literature I've read and encountered that explicitly addressed exploring the connection between dreaming and literature. It's a big topic, especially when one brings in mythological stories and their often dream-like logic. Maybe all of life is a dream within a dream, and literature a dream within that, etc. 

Specifically in a Chinese literary context with which I'm more familiar, one can point first toward the philosophy of Zhuangzi (am I Zhuangzi dreaming I'm a butterfly, or a butterfly dreaming I'm Zhuangzi?) and his distinction between ""great"" and ""small"" dreams, life's being the former:

*Men in general bustle about and toil; the sagely man seems stupid and to know nothing. He blends ten thousand years together in the one (conception of time); the myriad things all pursue their spontaneous course, and they are all before him as doing so. How do I know that the love of life is not a delusion? and that the dislike of death is not like a young person's losing his way, and not knowing that he is (really) going home? Li Ji was a daughter of the border Warden of Ai. When (the ruler of) the state of Jin first got possession of her, she wept till the tears wetted all the front of her dress. But when she came to the place of the king, shared with him his luxurious couch, and ate his grain-and-grass-fed meat, then she regretted that she had wept. How do I know that the dead do not repent of their former craving for life? Those who dream of (the pleasures of) drinking may in the morning wail and weep; those who dream of wailing and weeping may in the morning be going out to hunt. When they were dreaming they did not know it was a dream; in their dream they may even have tried to interpret it; but when they awoke they knew that it was a dream. And there is the great awaking, after which we shall know that this life was a great dream. All the while, the stupid think they are awake, and with nice discrimination insist on their knowledge; now playing the part of rulers, and now of grooms. Bigoted was that Qiu! He and you are both dreaming. I who say that you are dreaming am dreaming myself.* 

I would also allow special mention for this highly underappreciated classic: Tung, Yueh. *The tower of myriad mirrors: a supplement to Journey to the West*. Vol. 1. University of Michigan Press, 2020. Quite a literary trip! Highly recommended for more adventurous readers. Amazingly psychedelic, even.

And as well as, of course, the Qing dynastic classic Hong lou meng (Dream of the Red Chamber).

Beyond that, I've lately been enjoying works by Philip C. Dick such as Ubik and the Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch for their exploration of dream-like quasi-realities and pseudo-realities.

"I've been playing it lately and decided to buy the official rules books since I am really enjoying it. I came across this website because I had an add pop on other page with an offer of the DnD Core Rulebooks Set, pricing 90‚Ç¨ instead of the usual 110‚Ç¨ I had seen on amazon, so I thought it was a pretty great offer, since the shipping was only around 6‚Ç¨. I checked the page and it seemed legit so I bought it, i was saving almost 15‚Ç¨ that for me isn't a small quantity, since I'm still studying and have no source of income, apart from my savings.

Here comes the problem, it's been a week now since I made my order on AbeBooks, and within 2 days of the purchase I received a tracking code which was supposed to be linked with my order, everything seemed fine, I checked the order on the transporting company site (DHL in this case) and it said that the package couldn't be found on their database. I assumed this could be normal for the first 1 or 2 days since I had been notified from Abebooks that it could take up to 2 days for the information to update on the tracking. I checked it every day since then and still up to today the tracking number is still not working.

I tried to contact the library as to why was this happening, I got an email verifying that the message was received by the seller, and the same, a margin of 2 days for them to reply, this was 3 days ago and still no response. Today I tried contacting AbeBooks directly and have not received a reply. I know this may sound impatient from me, but I have made some research about AbeBooks and have found many negative reviews saying they have had a lot of trouble with them. 

I'm now not worried about the books getting to me, but about having back my money since I personally try to save it as hard as I can, and for once that I give myself a little caprice I feel I've been stupid by not doing enough research and that I may have been scammed.

"Am I the only one who thought this novel portrayed a utopian society after reading. I know it is regarded as an amazing dystopian work of fiction, but I could not help finding myself wanting to live there while reading. I understand there are some less than honorable traits of the society, but they seemed outweighed but the overall positives. 

Everyone is happy and full of pride in their work, orgies all the time, wonderful vacation drugs, and death seems pretty pleasant. Even if by some chance you are a rebel, you are not arrested or put to death, you just get to go hang out with people like you.

What? we just have to give up art, religion (all hail Ford)? Doesn‚Äôt seem too bad, most art is garbage, not to mention the artist who make it. I hear people talk about how the freedom to choose is the big reason for the dystopian premise. I don‚Äôt see it any different from our current social structure, most of our paths are heavily influenced by others at a young age, but in A Brave New World the repercussions of said influences and all positive..

"It's a book about a bunch of families holidaying at a loch, on one rainy summer day. It's by the author of **Ghost Wall**. I finished it a couple hours ago and I'm desperate to discuss it with people. What did you guys think?

My own thoughts, lazily copy-pasted from GR:

HM!

So I really enjoyed reading Summerwater - I loved all the too-real stream-of-consciousness. I laughed how relatable some of it was, and the stuff that was not relatable felt so real too. I also enjoyed all of the nature imagery. My mom sometimes complains that modern books don't really ""do"" nature anymore - ""It's like it's all written to be a Hollywood script!"" Summerwater goes the other direction, in a very charming way.

In the end though, I gave the book 3 stars. The low rating is not for anything in the book - it's for what ISN'T in the book. One of the biggest themes here is xenophobia. There's one group of ""foreigners"" that all the other characters side-eye and bitch about... and they are the only group that doesn't get a POV. I get that there is some stylistic choice to it - everyone has their own opinions about them but nobody knows them (and alternatively thinks are Romanian, Polish, etc. lmao - they're Ukrainian). Goodness gracious, that's xenophobia to a t, huh!

But. Like. When the whole book is about the minutia and detail of everyone's boring little lives, of letting us deep into their heads, this means the foreigners are the only ones who end up props amidst the very very alive and realistic cast. As a Ukrainian who did live in Scotland (and once got a flyer from UKIP about how people from ""the Ukraine"" should gtfo hahaha), it's bizarre to read a book that's kind of ""about"" me but not really ""for"" me. It makes the book feel kind of white-saviour-y (British-saviour-y lol?). I don't think I would have minded as much if not for the ending, which left an extremely sour taste in my mouth. Contrast this with Ghost Wall, which I loved, which both a) features a very different kind of ending and b) lets us get into the head of the character whose social plight the book wants to explore and defend.

I don't know, I'll have to think about it. Maybe I'll re-read it eventually and bump the rating back up - because until I got to the end of the book and realised that was it, it was a 5-star read for me.",books,2317

"Recently, I've been reading a lot of Steinbeck. Earlier this year I read Travels with Charley and enjoyed it, so I decided to pick up some of his fiction. First I read the novella Of Mice and Men, which I really did not like, mostly due to the ending. I did like the main characters and their friendship, although they could've done with a little more development. Then I read East of Eden, which I absolutely adored, due to its well-developed characters as well as its themes. After that experience, I was hungry for more, so I picked up the novella The Pearl, which I liked a bit more than Of Mice and Men (although for very different reasons), but still couldn't really seem to connect with.

I probably haven't read enough of him yet to make this claim, but I feel like John Steinbeck is better as a long fiction writer than a short fiction writer. I think his writing is at its best when the story and the characters get room to breathe and develop.

"Philosophy has been a constant in my everyday life. After devoting years to the books and studies, I started noticing a pattern in the books, topics such as Emotions, Love, Suicide, Death, and many others were repeating themselves in each new book I read. So after synthesizing every book, I have read into an easy to follow formula I decided to mix them all up into topic formulas.

To better organize all of this I created a [website.](https://www.desolhar-philo.com/)

The website will firstly show the structure of how these formulas are made in a step by step structure. After that, the formulas will be visible.

In the topic formula (On Choices), for example, you will have a general view of what philosophy has to speak about choices, first dividing in those that are within your power and those that are outside your reach, having, therefore, a more stoic approach. While reading the branches of the formulas you'll see that there are also some concepts from Dostoyevsky and other classics such as Herman Hesse and Kafka. That brings a bit of a dramatic view into a dense didactical structure. I understand this sounds like over the top approach to philosophy. But my intention is to keep perfecting them by finding incoherences and errors and keep complementing them with new books I read to make the formula richer in content.

The intention of this topic *f*ormulas is to synthesize a conversation that has been happening for centuries about a specific topic into an easy to follow structure.

Following this approach to philosophy, I will develop new topic formulas every month (On Relationships, On Humans, On Emotions, On suicide, etc‚Ä¶) plus exploring the same structure for books. For further discussions and suggestions, I created a[ subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Desolharphilo/).

The intention of all of this is to find people as passionate as me in the studies of philosophy to join this centuries-long conversation.

\*Note: Somone has brought up some spelling mistakes The thing is that English is not my native language and I am dyslexic. I am not saying this to victimize myself or to justify my typos. It's just something that I have to always make an extra effort for. I will update all formulas every month.

"First off, forgive my ignorance about the publishing industry, I'm just a humble reader. And forgive me if it's not the right sub either. 

I used to buy all my reads in mass market paperback format because they were cheap(er), size was smaller and handy to slip in a bag,  lighter (probably due to lesser quality paper) and  contrary to most, I liked that the spine cracked and pages dog-eared, my books just look so well-read, well-thumbed throughand loved. 

I notice though, lesser titles are going into mmp format and its frustrating because firstly sizes don't match on my bookshelves (how can a collection series be in different heights!) and secondly I have to wait a frustratingly long time for new titles to make their way to mmp format, and even a few years later, it might not even happen.

Is the industry giving up on the mmp format? Do I need to psych myself up to transition fully to trade pb size? How do I do that?",books,932
"There is a book on discount on Amazon called ""If you tell"" by Gregg Olsen. Seems to be based on a true story about I believe a horrible  mother abusing her kids. It has lots of reviews and a high rating as well. So before I make a purchase I read a few reviews and...some of them are saying its too gruesome. The details he describes and everything is too much and is disturbing.

Reading those reviews...I don't know whether I want to read something like this. But just wondering if reading literature like that helps in any way...like is it worth it to read stories like that? I mean I don't enjoy stuff like that, but has anyone read it?",books,640

I ended up with Rave by Irvine Welsh, I finished it in a few hours and realised it was just excerpts from his book Ecstasy!

I loved it though and could relate to most of it as my youth involved warehouse raves and festivals.

"One of the things that surprised me the most about this sub was the almost-weekly thread of ""I hate tie-in editions and wish they would stop"" and the amount of attention, awards and sympathy such threads get. I always thought people liked tie-in editions better than original ones so I was taken aback by what an unpopular opinion mine was. I actively search for tie-in editions to buy. 

Recently, I bought the tie-in editions of Les Miserables and I thought the cover was amazing. I was so sad when I bought Ken Follett's Pillars of the Earth and later realised there was an amazing tie-in edition available. I'm currently reading the tie-in edition of walter Isaacson's Einstein and seeing his face on the cover gives a better intimacy into his life. 

I guess I just wanted to point this out and see just how many others feel the same way as me. I find tie-in editions are usually more visceral in feel (although most are just pictures of the cast) and make the book look more interesting. I hope publishers don't stop publishing tie-in editions because some of us exist. 

Also, do you guys think this opinion against tie-ins only exists on this sub mainly? I think because most of us here read a lot of books, we are more partial to original covers. Whereas, people who only read books after the movies or read books **because** of the tie-in cover may love them becuase that's the only time they actually read books? I mean, if tie-ins are so unpopular, I doubt they'd be published continuously.",books,1502

"Books for my 92-year-old grandmother

Yesterday I spoke to my grandmother and I told her that I‚Äôm going to the bookstore to buy some literature. She told me that years ago when my granddad was still alive she loved to go to the library and get books for herself but that she can‚Äôt do it anymore because it‚Äôs too far away.
The only thing that she reads nowadays from cover to cover is her ‚Äúold people‚Äú magazines, because it‚Äôs the only thing that she gets weekly.

I think that‚Äôs absolutely sad that in 15 years she hadn‚Äôt had a chance to get a book for herself. I am unsure why she hasn‚Äôt asked us but I guess part of it is because she only knows of the library. Like, she has no idea you can get ANY book you want nowadays. 

I told her well I can get you anything that you want to read just tell me and I‚Äôll bring it to you. Of course, the kind grandmother that she is, she just asked me ‚Äúwill you choose for me?‚Äù.

And now I am in amok, because I don‚Äôt have a clue what she would enjoy. 

To give you a picture of who she is ‚Äì she is a 92-year-old Bulgarian woman, from an ex communist state, living alone in the countryside. She is a fascinating person. She took part in the second world war and sheltered jews in her home. She spend some time during the 70s in the 80s traveling through the USSR states with my grandfather. She was a manager for long years in the Bulgarian United Dairy Company (privatized now). After that they build a house together and spend the rest of their life there. She was VERY fashionable. Like serious communist chic. She is very strong both mentally and physically and I don‚Äôt think that she has any plans of slowing down soon! She still looks after her huge yard with flowers and vegetables and chickens. 
In the magazines that she reads there‚Äôs articles about 130 year old recipes, mysticism, some Bulgarian history, and some fascinating stories from the first half of the 20th century. 

I might end up getting her some collection of memoirs, some in-depth history of her hometown, Plovdiv. But I was wondering if there‚Äôs some novel maybe.

I would appreciate any suggestion. Also, it would be interesting to me to see a discussion about what is your opinion when it comes to reading contemporary work by the elderly. Surely, there are topics and styles that might not suit older audiences, especially those that have a significant gap. No pressure, just shoot your guess.",books,2409

"The 18th century, known to historians as the Age of enlightenment, was not long after the advent of Newtonian mechanics, when human knowledge made a breakthrough and the optimism characteristic of that era permeated Europe. Man has boasted that he holds the key to the mysteries of the universe, and with the advance of knowledge it is only a matter of time before he is confident that he will have dominion over nature, and that his well-being will be infinitely enhanced in the bright future. It was also at this time that, for the first time in history, historians declared, in what would now seem naive tones, that history moves in a linear fashion. The utilitarian scientific ideal of Bacon, the mathematical physics of Newton, the political thought of John Locke and the naive optimism of Voltaire were the enlightenment stars shining over Europe in the eighteenth century. If there is one word that defines this century in history, it is reason. Yes, this is the age of the awakening of reason. The classical reason of ancient Greece has been sleeping for more than a thousand years under the oppression of the Christian belief in the Middle Ages. It finally stands on the horizon of the age, but without the prudence and moderation of the classical era, we can vaguely foreboding the heavy nightmare of the 20th century from its grey shadow. At that time, no one had such a presentiment. Swift, a prophetic thinker in the age of Enlightenment, looked on coldly at the modern rational trend at that time, and was the first to question the enlightenment planning. http://www.storkxx.com/2020/08/hundreds-more-sick-in-outbreak-traced-to-thomson-international-onions/

Swift (1667-1745), the illusion of satire gulliver's travels to the popular traveling ""genre describes the Lilliput, brobdingnag, le skin it island, the houyhnhnms four country local conditions and customs, such as in his works reflects the European political and social conditions at that time, and describe his ideal kingdom in the form of a utopia. Lilliput is a reference to the corrupt and petty political landscape of Britain and continental Europe, where people were small, greedy and selfish, and virtuous in proportion to their size. On the contrary, the people of the Monseigneur were the giants of simplicity and contentment, noble and upright, like the ancient citizens of the ancient Greek city-states admired by Swift. There was a flying island on Lapidus, suspended in the air by magnetic devices, inhabited by a group of Kings and courtswho spent their days thinking of mathematics and music. They were indifferent to everything else, including their wives and children. They were grotesque and boring, which Swift used as a satire on the then Royal Society. The cruel oppression of the ruler of the flying Island on the people below apparently reflects Swift's ominous foreboding of the totalitarian rule that science may bring about. In the land of the Houyhnhnms, the order of rule between man and horse was reversed, with men becoming lowly beasts and horses becoming noble masters. Here Swift despairs of the moral state of mankind.

In this book, Swift adopted the form of a utopian fantasy novel, but it was quite different from similar novels popular at that time. If we trace the genealogy of modern utopias, we find that they were all, at first, the republic or positive utopias, from Utopia and Sun City to Christchurch, without exception. Bacon's New Big Island is undoubtedly also within this genealogy. What makes it special is that it creates a scientific utopia by linking the prospect of utopia with the progress of science. It was not until the 20th century, when the illusion of progress was shattered by an unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe, that utopias began to emerge, as were Brave New World, 1984, and Us. The significance of Swift lies in that, as early as the rise of utopian fantasy, his works have integrated the double fantasy of positive utopia and dystopian. Lilliput and Laputa can be classified as dystopias, while the Land of the Houyhnhnms and the Land of the Houyhnhnms can be counted as positive Utopias. Gulliver's Travels has a structure of ""reverse - positive - reverse - positive"", in which dystopia and positive utopia interweave with each other, which not only deeply worries about the future of enlightenment, but also hopes for a better life. But a closer analysis reveals that even his positive utopia is quite different from the philistinism of the time. Almost all the utopian visionary their ideal points to the future or exotic - one is located in the northwest corner of Europe and Asia at that time people have never experienced a time or space, swift a buck the trend, look to the ancient, in his brobdingnag exotic travel with the houyhnhnms, we easily is out of the classical era's noble and elegant. Therefore, Swift's utopia is not a fantasy, let alone a rational and arrogant design, on the contrary, it admires the ancient worship of classical, criticizes the age with memory, and puts his ideal and reflection into a strange utopia. There is a golden age that once existed but no longer exists, so it can be classified as a dystopian spectrum, just as there is a terrible world that is emerging or intended to be realized, and which is becoming more and more absurd and ugly in contrast to the former, so it can also be classified as a dystopian spectrum. It is his admiration for the ancient times that makes the utopia he created present the interweaving and conflict between the positive and the negative.

This conflict is also ancient and modern politics and philosophy and conflict. Swift turned a cold eye to the enlightenment, which was just emerging at that time, and he did not hesitate to side with the ancients in all disputes between the ancient and the modern. The purpose of enlightenment is to replace custom with science, superstition with reason, and ignorance with progress. According to Kant's classical definition, the Enlightenment is the process by which man moves from his immaturity to maturity, that is, the courage to use his reason freely without the guidance of others. The slogan of the Enlightenment was, have the courage to use your own reason. Use reason to guide itself, that's what Kant says about reason. But what Kant is expressing is a self-affirming reason, an inner moral law, which we should not ignore the starry heavens above us. The subject of enlightenment is not only content to legislate for nature, but also intends to conquer nature with the power of reason. Bacon's famous saying ""knowledge is power"" is the first expression of this utilitarian ideal. In his New Big Island, Bacon conceived of a scientific utopia. A group of Solomon Palace scientists had a clear division of labor, and they managed the whole country in an orderly manner. They are a combination of knowledge and virtue, high and powerful, and under their rule, the whole country is harmonious, orderly and prosperous. For the first time in history, Bacon based politics on science rather than on the virtue of citizens and rulers. This was partly because Bacon was obsessed with the utilitarian effects of science, and partly because he believed that science could promote moral education. In these two points, Swift is exactly opposite to Bacon and all enlightenment advocates.

In Gulliver's Travels, Swift USES Laputa to fly to the island in response to Bacon's New Daki, The Lagado Academy to Solomon's Palace, and the anti-scientific utopia to the scientific utopia. The scientists and rulers of Laputa island are obsessed with abstract science, regardless of the customs and life of the world. They are clumsy in their actions and need human guidance in everything. Dialogue to remind the servant, wife face to face with people cheating, ridiculous and unsympathetic. Such people are destined to be science geeks looking up at the orbits of the planets, lacking the sense of reality necessary for a politician. More to the point, such a group of experts is not virtuous, if not virtuous. Therefore, on the question of knowledge and virtue, Swift is an antithesis of Bacon. Not only that, in the relationship between knowledge and society, Swift also formed an antithesis to Bacon. Bacon believed that scientific knowledge, as a Gospel, would bring blessings to human civilization. But Swift's book presents a frightening picture of scientific dominion, in which flying islands on The Island of Lupit are suspended above and can be adjusted in height and position according to Gilbert's new physics. If any people on the island rebelled against its rule, their homes would suddenly be flattened by the flying islands. The difference between modern usurpation and ancient usurpation is that modern usurpation is founded on reason and science rather than ignorance and fanaticism. Swift was especially wary of the political domination of scientists, believing that there was a natural boundary between science and politics, and that using science to guide politics would inevitably lead to political disorder.

The two themes about science that Swift initiated have continued to resonate and deepen for generations to come. On the issue of science and virtue, Rousseau first responded in his ""On Science and Art"". He believed that science and art, as a universal and super-regional thing, would inevitably undermine the moral foundation of civil society. Later, By dividing the phenomenal world from the thing in itself, pure reason from practical reason, Kant opened up an internal space for moral practice, and objectively rescued reason and science from the moral criticism temporarily. However, Horkheimer and Adorno finally criticized this scheme in Dialectics of the Enlightenment, thinking that such an attempt to base moral foundation on the good will in the heart is ineffective, and morality will eventually turn into barbarism in the face of the calculation of material benefits. In the case of science and society, the concern that science leads to totalitarianism is also expressed in dialectics of the Enlightenment. Myth is enlightenment; Enlightenment reverts to myth. This is the dialectic of the Enlightenment, which shows us how the instrumentality of reason based on calculation can dissimilate and in turn enslave man himself, and today's greatest divinity is nothing but science and technology designed to dispel myth.

The original intention of the Enlightenment is to free people from the domination of blind forces, but the science and technology that cross the boundary has become the most blind force today. If we are to reaffirm enlightenment, we must rethink science and technology itself. Taming science and technology is the most important task of our age. Whether or not this task is possible, we all need a utopia of hope in which we can avoid despair and extract the courage to act. This is exactly the attitude embodied in Swift's two-faced utopia, which is what he is all about, and what makes him superior to some of the so-called postmodern masters.",books,11063

"Introduction: The beginning of existentialist literature

In the modern history of western philosophy, Sartre is a have to mention the name, as will the existential philosophy promoted the French thinker, revolutionist, in the process of its philosophical foundation is under the influence of a Russian writer, that is in the west ""has one of the most widely read in the 19th century novelist"", ""one of the world's greatest novelist dostoyevsky, especially the death house's handbook and the basement's handbook, these literary works are also to Sartre's philosophy thought played a role that nots allow to ignore.

Notes in the Basement has been regarded by researchers as one of the most wonderful existentialist documents. Surprising is that one has caused wide public concern in modern life, rather than in strictly philosophical works in literary works, and of the last century literature) has been one of the best reflected, this shows that in a certain sense, in terms of spiritual essence, existential thought perhaps closer to literature and religion, and not highly abstract, rigorous logic expression of philosophy. In the prevailing existentialist trend, philosophy and literature have always been closely linked, but the language of literature is sometimes more accurate and powerful than the dry language of philosophy to express profound philosophy.

From the death house's handbook and the basement notebook can be seen in dostoyevsky for the limits of life experience, the experience the aesthetic needs of scholars is legal countries, the experience of death is undoubtedly feel self is a way of deep feeling, and notice to dig deeper into itself and existentialism exploration is also well known.

Another reason why A Note in the Basement is considered existentialist literature is the ""absurdity"" it expresses. In the opinion of Camus, another representative of existentialist philosophy, the world is absurd, reality itself is unrecognizable, human existence lacks rationality, life is lonely, and life is meaningless. This happens to coincide with the thinking of the protagonist of ""Notes from the Basement"". According to Camus, Dostoyevsky ""is a novelist of existential philosophy"". ""Notes from the Basement"" has been called ""the best existentialist overture ever written"". Dostoyevsky was not only a writer, but also a prophet, and his ideas were accepted and praised by philosophers a century later.

Once published in 1864, Notes from the Basement was fiercely attacked by the Russian revolutionary Democratic Party headed by Chedrin. Even in the 1950s, the preface to Dostoyevsky's collected Works published by the National Literature Publishing House of the former Soviet Union still called The Notes in the Basement ""one of the most reactionary works"" of the writer. In the West, in 1887, the German philosopher and voluntist Nietzsche wrote to a friend with great joy after he happened to read the French translation of this book. He said, ""A few weeks ago I did not know that there was a name Dostoyevsky... In the bookshop, by chance on the shelf, the title of a book caught my attention. It was recently translated into French... A bloodline instinct (what else would I call it?) Call it straight out, and I'm more than happy.""

A mockery of ""all that is good and noble""

""I'm a sick man..."" Such a beginning could be included in the list of classical literary beginnings. The spiteful man is one who has a hard time with himself. He decided to get tough with others because he got tough with himself. He has it against him because he finds himself so full of irreconcilable contradictions that he cannot draw conclusions about anything, or even form clear and desperate answers about whether he is a ""malevolent man"". He gives the impression that he really wants to be forgiven, but then says, caustically: In fact, he doesn't care what people think -- ""I don't give a shit what you think...""  www.storkxx.com/2020/08/wawona-recalls-peaches-linked-to-multi-state-salmonella-outbreak/

Perhaps this is an extremely arrogant person. But the fact that this supremely arrogant man has the humility to know that he can do nothing shows that he is full of personal contradictions. On the one hand he felt like a hero compared with the false ones, and on the other he felt like a vermin and a wretched insect. So we sometimes sympathize very much with the Earthman, whose conceit, pride and confidence hides a deep sense of inferiority.",books,4465
"The chilly sky of winter, quietly sitting at the table, open this read how many times the ""love education"", I can still feel the warm and gentle breath in my side spread, it is sending out the thick love, take me into this one simple clear story, feeling the love around, is this book gives me a the most beautiful of enlightenment.

This book, in the name of a pupil, USES the situation of the diary recorded a hundred touching stories. In my opinion, all the stories are so ordinary, there is no flat praise for love and gratitude and exciting story, but I was attracted by it, in the vast sea of books to seek its figure again and again. Because this book can bring people a warm current in the cold winter, let us follow a heart filled with love, to feel the love around, all readers can have a bright and simple mood, to listen to this child's story, listen to this child's love for life.

Every time I read this book, I will read the master's understanding of Enrico for several times. Every time I read this book, I will have a lot of experience. Although Enrico is just a young child, he can feel the love around him from a little thing or even a look. Even though sometimes Enliko would lose his courage due to the setbacks in life, his keen insight into love and his heart for discovering love would kindle his longing for life. Enrico is often deeply moved by the little help from others to his partners. He often feels love from many ordinary things, remembers the love of others, and often gives them his most sincere blessing when others offer their love. However, he always hides his words in his heart, and feels and feels them by himself. In a short semester, every seemingly plain day, Enrico's eyes and his narration are full of beauty, holiness and deep and shallow perception. Sometimes I wonder why it is just a child with a praise and love for life that cannot be surpassed by adults. Today, I repeatedly read this book and gave myself a satisfactory answer -- because it will feel the love around it. Perhaps life is always full of ordinary and boring, there are always a lot of things not happy, day by day, but we can not use a short day to complete their great ideal, this time to have what kind of attitude? Well, tell me, where are you going with sporadic time to feel love, so I try to do, the first ray of sunshine in the morning, the sun for the love of all things, mom a gentle greetings, is a mother's love to their children, busy crowd in the street, a young child a face of joy, when he give you happiness is spreading love,,,,,,,,

When I looked at the sunset sinking, sighed in the day has so much love, just know that this is happiness. I use one day, with their own eyes to find love, to listen to love, has never had the happiness, if every heart, with their every day to pursue, to feel, the real not satisfied, the real ordinary is just their excuse.

Enliko and his companions, perhaps with that feeling of love in their hearts, faced all the days. I took the book in my hands, and it seemed to me that enliko's young voice and his light step opened my heart. storkxx.com/2020/08/more-peaches-implicated-in-salmonella-enteritidis-outbreak/

Waiting for us, is countless new day, drips contain the sincere feeling of love, with the most sincere attitude, to feel the love around you, with the most hot mood, to feel the love around you. In fact, everything will not be ordinary. When we truly feel the love around us, I believe that we will have a happy life like Enrico and look forward to every new morning just like him.",books,3566

"In my head, a lot of confrontations I‚Äôd read, especially in classics, seemed quite restrained and mundane, like they lacked any real emotional depth. I‚Äôd never really considered in my head the expression of dialogue, I just read it in an automatic way like narration.  
It was only when I watched a dramatisation of a few scenes from Anna Karenina that the detached way I tended to read the dialogue completely shifted because I saw how it could be given this incredible emotional intensity.
Since then I‚Äôve tried to slow down when I read key scenes of dialogue and really put effort into imagining gestures, facial expressions and the way lines would actually be spoken aloud by the characters. I get so much more out them now than when used to just read through in a less conscious way.  It‚Äôs made me think a lot about what can be lost when people read exclusively in their head instead of out loud.

The stories all seem to deal with linguistics, language and literary criticism. I had heard a lot of structuralist theorists claim how reality was primarily predicated upon language, and although I could never wrap my head around the concept, ""Tl√∂n, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius"" provided a great demonstration of this concept!

"Hello everyone!

I hope this post is not against the promotion rule, I couldn't open the wiki to see if it meets the requirements (It says it's not available anymore) so I'll give it a shot. 
So I talked to someone who is in their twenties about the issues with being bombarded with billions of opinions every single day in the internet and how it is often a struggle to distinguish right from wrong nowadays. We oftentimes base our opinion on approval of others and on context, while back in the day (I see this often in Boomers and Gen X) people seem to have had stronger and more unshakeable moral compasses. 
With the amount of opinions and perspectives we get to see every day it's hard to figure out what's right and what is wrong.

But that is just one of many struggles todays generations have to face every single day. I plan to write a book about this struggles, so someone might feel heard and offer some help, so these struggles can become less. 

For that I wanted to ask you, what are your struggles nowadays? What challenges do you face living in the digital age? 
And to the older redditors: do you see new challenges for yourself compared to the time you grew up? What are these?

Authors were using style which was much more suited to normal novels. There were dialogues between characters that he obviously havent heard and really descreptive depictions of places he havent saw. It was all written in third person like a normal book and never jumped out to lets say police reports or media reactions.

"I chanced upon an article recently on how readers of fiction tend to become more empathic.

Personally I feel that this is not  directly related, at least not for all fiction readers.

My thoughts are that a lot depends on the content of the fiction that one is reading. Simply looking at things through the eyes of different characters while reading a fiction doesn't necessarily translate to having an increased inclination to 'feel or think for others' in a social setting.

The content of the book itself has to have a stronger relation to promoting empathy. In fact, non-fiction books like life memoirs, biographies, history, culture, experiences etc. has a stronger case for promoting empathy in people. Knowing and understanding the experiences of real people, cultures, societies can have a tangible impact on a person's views of those around him and is more likely to translate to an increase in empathy.

That said, if the fiction novel is centred strongly on promoting empathic responses, then that may work too.

What do you guys think?

"I prefer authors that are honest about their process and where they are in life. Although the authors who take a guru-like approach can be assuring at providing certainty behind their messages, their messages don't always connect as it sometimes over promises and underwhelmingly under delivers; I see this often in the Amazon book reviews section. How is it possible that two people can read the same book and land on opposite ends of the sentiment spectrum? For several five star reviews, there are one star reviews of the same book where the readers are baffled by the glowing reviews because they believe, ""the book has a lot fluff, repetitive content, doesn't provide practical steps, makes bold assertions without support them with experiential or scientific proof"". Is this a question of expectation management or close mindedness? I'd love to hear what you think.",books,871

The blatant honesty, no sugar coating, just casually informing us of the atrocities that occurred during WWII, mainly as background to the story, but necessary for us to know. The power of words. They can feed you or starve you. Save you or kill you. You can hate them or love them or both. Words can birth a movement, good or bad. They can fuel it or stomp it out. They can placate you, soothe you, or anger you, put you in a rage. Ultimately, our lives are the sum of all the words we have said and all those we have not. I love you, Rudy.",books,679
"I pre-ordered Blood and Honey on Amazon. It was expensive, and I expected it to be packaged appropriately so my brand new book wouldn't arrive bent to heck. Instead, it was tossed in a large box with absolutely zero padding or anything protecting it and is severely damaged as can be expected. This is the second time this has happened, although the first time the book did not arrive too bad so I let it go. This time, I'm devastated, I'm not letting it go, and I'll be having them both returned as this is the final straw. 

The problem is, I pre-ordered Blood and Honey and submitted my receipt for pre-order incentives which haven't been sent out yet. Could I lose my incentives when I return the book for my money back?

"Hello, I am a teenager who not recently but about a year ago struck up an interest in books and reading. I remember when I first started I would get really distracted during reading and often lose my train of thought resulting in me reading what was in front of me but not understanding it and digesting it. I always thought this was natural since my entertainment was usually faster paced and did not require attention and much thought. However a year later, after reading many books I am still having this problem and it has gotten much worse too. I found that my attention span has significantly lowered even when doing some of the things I really enjoyed, such as reading. I get way too distracted or lost in my head.

"I‚Äôm homeschooling my 7th grader this year after he was falling behind at school. We are sticking close to the public school curricula for most subjects, but are going our own way on reading and writing because his interest is so low and his skill gaps are so high. I first just need to help him enjoy reading and writing again like he did in early elementary. Once it‚Äôs comfortable and familiar again, we can push harder on his writing difficulties.

Over the summer, I assigned The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. He got through it but dialect and unfamiliar idioms slowed him down. He did better with Animal Farm. He‚Äôs growing more interested in history and government so it was a good fit.

But holy cow, he sped through The Giver. He read longer than I requested each day, eager to keep going, and we have had great conversations. At the dinner table, on walks, he keeps having interesting things to say about it.

I don‚Äôt want to lose the momentum. Any other just right choices for a 12 year old boy with learning differences? He doesn‚Äôt like anything too childish, but I don‚Äôt want to pick something too far beyond his lexicon.

Is there a something you‚Äôd suggest with that is well-written but not overly difficult with exciting action or ideas that may foster interesting discussion or essay responses?

"Just finished the 5 book series and absolutely loved it. A great interpretation of fantasy with dragons and elves and a girl growing up in this world.

I particularly loved reading the first few books. Often we only see the hero of a fantasy story in their prime, but the first three books of the series just show the main character, Jahrra, as she grows up.  She has normal issues like bullies at school, overbearing guardians, and even what courses to do at University.

The last two books become more traditional fantasy, with magic, fighting against a god, and a long lost prince reclaiming his throne.

Overall I loved this series and the detail that went into writing it.",books,677

"To whom it may concern,

My name is Spencer and I am in screen writer. I have been writing many different stories which I believe would be good novels. I‚Äôve been writing for over nearly 18 years as of November. Due to my brain chemistry/high functioning Asperger‚Äôs, I‚Äôm not able to write in novel style. I don‚Äôt see things as well as you need to for a novel. However, I do see it better when thinking about it as a movie or TV show many of my stories. But I‚Äôve always wanted to be a novelist. That‚Äôs been my lifelong goal but I love reading novels as much as I do watching movies and such. I just don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever get that dream to come true unless I find somebody to help me do this. 

I have many different stories but one in particular I believe make a good epic novel. I believe in another life or another dimension I am a full time novelist. One who writes novels no shorter then 500 pages and longer then war/peace. I love long movies and stories that you get lost in. You lose all sense of time and become wrapped up in the story that can take months to years to finish reading/writing.

The specific novel I see as something like taking the Royal Tenenbaums, the 1950s movie Sabrina, To catch a thief, The great Gatsby, and other Ideas. Putting them together into one story sort of...

The pot is as follows. This is not my plot, it should be known. I have added to it and expanded it. It is inspired by a famous screenwriters on need/never to be produced teaching tool of a screenplay that I enjoyed and want to write into its own thing. Still similar to this in its DNA and yet my own work!

My title of the story is called LIFELINE (placeholder for the moment).

THE PLOT:

Two men, Joseph Climber (late 60s) and Joseph Cimber Jr. (late 40s) are rescuers for hire. Rescuers are the branch by which firemen, police, and other such jobs are placed. Only, these rescuers come from outside the lines of their Help. If you are in too deep with bad people or such  related issues like: Having money trouble,kidnappings, or any other amount of innumerable bad choices or actions. If you need help and can‚Äôt go to the so called ‚ÄúNormal‚Äù or clean routes -- you come to them. It‚Äôs with these two rescuers we see them on a job, the safe return of a wealthy man‚Äôs daughter from some underworld fiends. As the job comes to its conclusion, they are paid and go on their own ways. But, it's not the last time they will see this rich world and these people that they were hired By. The woman they saved, JESSICA, asks them to come up to the estate in LONG ISLAND BEACH (LONG BEACH CITY). 

It there that two fathers from different backgrounds and financial standings become acquainted and friendly. While two ‚ÄúKids‚Äù (based on the differences between the ages of their parents but actual pubescence) aquant each other. It‚Äôs like something out of to catch a thief or the original Sabrina (1954), or the emotional growth in Notorious (1946). Something under the surface is growing and changing before their very eyes. As the Day, waxes and wanes itself to its conclusion, two disparate souls, learn about their differences, and their connections. Joseph knows he would never had met such an amazing woman with all this money, power, and beauty had it not been for the safe capture and return of her to her father! 

As they drive home, father and son, discuss the day, how thankful Jessica‚Äôs father was, how Jessica seems to like his son, and how ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt it be nice‚Äù to have lots of Money. Living in Manhattan, in a cheap and far removed from the splendor and fabulous wealth they had seen earlier that day. Joseph goes to sleep thinking of Jessica. And it is from that day, a friendship blossoms. When not working on a jobs as rescuers, sometime together, the father and son go back to the estate or Joseph goes Alone. After sometimes a few months to a year or two (maybe a little more even three or four), their friendship ends and becomes much more -- A ROMANTIC FAIRYTALE RELATIONSHIP. 

As the years goes by Jessica changes Joseph from a man of meager means into a man of grace, elegance, and charm to fit in with the rich, wealthy, fat cats of the world! They have a family of 4-5 kids, each one more talented and inventive then the last. The Most brilliant combination of them all is the shy, daddy‚Äôs girl Phoebe (said like PHOBIA (PHOBIE)) as Joseph is read the name wrong on the birth 
Certificate. 

As the kids have grown, and Joseph‚Äôs father age, he 
tells them stories of the past and the jobs he 
‚ÄúUSED‚Äù to take with his son, that he no longer does! 
Eventually, Joseph‚Äôs father curcomes to old age and dies Happy in the wealth his son and family keep themselves accustomed to for generations to come. Little does he know As he passes away, a slowly building gap has been growing between the once true lovers. Joseph, has never quite felt  too comfortable with all this money, charity events,  dances, Job set up by Jessica‚Äôs father (to put him behind a desk), the raising of the kids in this fanciness, etc. His wife on the other hand tries to have a marriage counselor comes to the mansion. 

It only splits them more in two. As she finds out: He wants the old life he had back and slowly, grows more distant, disgruntled, and disheartened to his wife, angered as well by the fact her father is still alive and his is not! He is also perturbed by the snot nosed uppity friends she has, mainly, the man who has been snooping around and trying to win her affections in order to take her away from him. Tarrence Willberman the third, or Trip (Trip short for triple), A Rupert Everett type, but more smarmy and like a cheap lawyer.

Eventually, they come to terms with their existence and they devorce. He goes back to the city into his old existence. Seeing the kids on weekends and even more seldom than that. Why? Because Trip keeps trying to get into the family, until he can marry into it and forever remove their father/ex-husband from their memory/lives. 

During his days apart from the children, he wonders one simple fact: ‚ÄúWas he really supposed to meet JESSICA, have the life he did and have the kids? Was it all for nothing, but a wasted part of his life? Did she plan for him to rescue her and transform her life as if out of a fairytale? Was her life that boring she needed a commoner to sweep her off her feet and show her a different way of life? Maybe or maybe not,‚Äù he thinks he‚Äôll never know.

As legal orders still allow the children to see their father, they do! During one of their visits, as he has secretly done in the past (now and again). He has worked with the children (now in their teenage years of various ages) on one of his jobs. This job goes awry and one of the children gets very badly hurt (PHOBIE) thus he loses contact with the children forever. All due to the fact that the law finds him an unfit father. He is lost, as a few years have passed, and on the brink of suicide, needing love and his chidren back in his life. It is then that he is needed again, as she, daddy‚Äôs girl, has been kidnapped because of her brains and great knowledge, an invention she created worth millions of dollars. 

Joseph presupposes that the man behind it is TRIP in order to destroy him, not just financially, but fully and forever. So what was once his bed will be the bed of another man in his bed and with his wife (who he wants back as much as he wants his children and child). Through a series of ordeals he is able to save and stop those who stole his beloved daughter, get the love of his wife back (which was never really gone) and bring back the family unit into one unit -- NOW AND FOREVER MORE-- for all time!

"Hello all,

I recently bought 4 books online from a reputable seller with a reliable exchange program. 2 of the books have a couple of pages that are slightly dog-eared. It honestly looks like an ""assembly-line""/ manufacturing defect, rather than someone intentionally folding them. In both books, there's a cluster of about 5 pages where the corner is folded in. And in one of the books, it looks like the pages got cut incorrectly, because when I unfold the page, there's ""extra"" page there that overruns the normal shape of it. 

It would nearly no inconvenience for me to stop at a brick-and-mortar location to exchange them. But what is the fate of books that are damaged like this?

"Yesterday I spoke to my grandmother and I told her that I‚Äôm going to the bookstore to buy some literature. She told me that years ago when my granddad was still alive she loved to go to the library and get books for herself but that she can‚Äôt do it anymore because it‚Äôs too far away.
The only thing that she reads nowadays from cover to cover is her ‚Äúold people‚Äú magazines, because it‚Äôs the only thing that she gets weekly.

I think that‚Äôs absolutely sad that in 15 years she hadn‚Äôt had a chance to get a book for herself. I am unsure why she hasn‚Äôt asked us but I guess part of it is because she only knows of the library. Like, she has no idea you can get ANY book you want nowadays. 

I told her well I can get you anything that you want to read just tell me and I‚Äôll bring it to you. Of course, the kind grandmother that she is, she just asked me ‚Äúwill you choose for me?‚Äù.

And now I am in amok, because I don‚Äôt have a clue what she would enjoy. 

To give you a picture of who she is ‚Äì she is a 92-year-old Bulgarian woman, from an ex communist state, living alone in the countryside. She is a fascinating person. She took part in the second world war and sheltered jews in her home. She spend some time during the 70s in the 80s traveling through the USSR states with my grandfather. She was a manager for long years in the Bulgarian United Dairy Company (privatized now). After that they build a house together and spend the rest of their life there. She was VERY fashionable. Like serious communist chic. She is very strong both mentally and physically and I don‚Äôt think that she has any plans of slowing down soon! She still looks after her huge yard with flowers and vegetables and chickens. 
In the magazines that she reads there‚Äôs articles about 130 year old recipes, mysticism, some Bulgarian history, and some fascinating stories from the first half of the 20th century.

Basically from what I can remember an old man or lady, each year volunteers at a local charity (I believe the Samaritans?). I believe it‚Äôs Xmas but could be NYE. 

However this year that person can‚Äôt work that night but pleads and begs too, but instead a new person works it. 

The girl who takes over the shift gets a phone call from a lady claiming he‚Äôs after her or something and that she‚Äôs worried but suddenly it cuts off. Then throughout the night she gets more and more phone calls getting worse and worse. 

Eventually the lady finds out the location and goes there and is basically lead into a trap as she nearly drowns but is saved by the person who couldn‚Äôt make the shift. 

I believe the person who couldn‚Äôt make the shift was working years and years ago that night when the person ringing died. I believe she drowned and the story says each year she rings back looking for peace and that same person is there out of guilt or wanting to help her find peace and knows she‚Äôs a ghost but doesn‚Äôt want anyone else to live that horror. 

As in typing this I actually believe she could have been murdered.

Has anyone read any stories set in a fairly realistic version of a pre-modern setting that featured a monstrous animal or terrible alien?  The movie Brotherhood of the wolf comes to mind. While I did enjoy Moby Dick I'm looking for work by a contemporary author.  Moby Dick himself was a wonderful metaphor but I'm looking for something more like Jaws. 

\[no spoilers are included below\] For example, I read a book recently that was in a pioneer setting that featured a run-in with a group of holdover sabertooth tigers. ( White Death By: Christine Morgan ).  It was entertaining. Shadow Beast is a book featuring a monstrous great cat.  Killer is a book by David Drake that pits a man who procures animals for The Coliseum in Ancient Rome V.S. a creature from a crashed alien spaceship.

I'm about to purchase Feeling Good. Before I go through with my purchase, I wanted to ask if anyone can tell me major differences in the editions? I ask this because on Good Reads someone commented ""don't get the new edition if you aren't interested in drugs/anti-depressants - it is a hefty book and the older editions aren't as lengthy."" Soooo is this accurate? I will say, I am interested in this book more for the CBT element and how I can use it to help with anxiety. I don't take anti-depressants or would consider myself depressed. 

The price difference is not the issue for me, more so the length/concentration. 

Thanks",books,645
"**Happy National Literacy Month, everyone!** 

To bring awareness to the importance of literacy, my two-year-old daughter and I have begun recording readings together of some of her favorite books.  You can give our first one a listen here: [Reading with Luna: We Are Music by Brandon Stosuy](https://www.lunita.nyc/post/reading-with-luna-we-are-music).

It's my hope that we can continue to create and share more of these because:

**a)** It's important for children to have access to read-alouds (especially with most libraries closed at the moment)

**b)** It's important for parents to see the enthusiasm and energy that can be put into reading with their children -- reading does NOT have to be boring

**c)** I'm just a proud father that enjoys creating with his daughter.

Don't mean for this to be a promotional post, just a father that wanted to share his love of reading with his daughter.

Let me know what you think! Wishing you all health and happiness!",books,966
"Obviously the 2010s have seen a huge renaissance in all things super hero with the success of the MCU, I like comics but have never gotten into them too much.

"Can someone help me settle a debate between myself and my mother?  


I have never been a big fan of reading books. I've always been one of those people who could read an entire page, get to the end of it, and completely forgot what I just read.  
However, after discovering audio books, I have been able to enjoy many stories that I probably would have never read before.  
I recently told my mother that I have been reading more, and she looked at me confused and said ""But you've always hated reading, what changed?""  
I looked at her and said ""Well I've been listening to audio books.""  
Which is when she laughed and said ""Oh so you're not actually reading, someone is just reading to you. That's not reading.""  
Which is when I said ""Well, it still counts as reading because I'm still getting the same story. I'm just listening to it, instead of holding the book in my hands.""  
She said it doesn't count as ""actually reading"".  


I was hoping someone could help me settle this debate.  
Because in my opinion, it doesn't matter if you are holding a book or listening to it...as long as you are getting the story...either in print or audio, it still counts as reading.",books,1175

"I am at chapter 30 ""Domestic Scenes"", it's when SPOILERS Arthur comes back from London after a very long stay and starts drinking heavily. And I just realised that we don't get back to Gilbert till 15 more chapters?? I have been longing to see what happens between Gilbert and Helen and I really like Gilbert's character even though he's immature, I want to see him evolve but this scenes from a marriage thing has been going on for so long I'm actually getting annoyed. It's interesting but sometimes I feel it is too much and after reading about Gilbert and Yorkshire in the beginning it seems we've just completely abondoned that part of the story or it has been waiting for too long... At this point I don't even know if I want to continue the book or immediately skip to chapter 45 where we can resume the Gilbert storyline and then see if I should go back and continue reading Helen's marital details. 

Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed learning about her marriage and such but I wish there was some break in between to go back to Gilbert and so on. I really want to know what actually happened between Arthur and Helen and how it must have affected Arthur Jr. but I'm really not in mood to read about their marriage anymore...

"Recently, I read book called atomic habits by James clear. I must say guys it is one of the best book I ever read not only to build habits but also to sustain them in long run . 

According to author, There are three levels of behavior change outcome change, process change and identity change.

Let's discuss each of them

**1)Outcome change:** 

**Outcome change** is all about focusing on your goals like loosing weight, writing a book, any other your accomplishment you want to achieve.

**2)Process change**

in this type of change, you are more concerned about changing habits and building a sustainable system like daily workout in a gym, meditation, journaling and so forth.

**3)Identity change**

In this type of behavior change your are more focused towards changing your beliefs. This is all about changing your world-wide self-image.

In the outcome change you are more focus on your output rather than enjoying the journey. Process is all about what you do and identity is all about what you believe.

**Let me explain identity change in details**

**Yes,** our goals are to read the book, but by becoming a reader.

**Yes**, our goal is to win a marathon, but by becoming a runner

**Yes**, our goal is to learn an instrument, but by becoming a musician.

In the end, this kind of approach to habit formation helps to reform your identity.

And those who willing to form a healthy habits, I would recommed to read this book. 

**Do you agree with the authors point of view of behavior change?**",books,1509

"I will preface this by saying I did not grow up in a religious household but my parents encouraged me to explore my own spirituality and to remain open minded. I've gone to church when my friends invited me, I sat through mass, and I've gone to church camp. I had a fundamental understanding of the faith but I was never truly able to connect with it.  

Even though I could understand some of the controversy, I was still fascinated by the book's premise. I deeply appreciated how the author chose to keep Jesus' ministry in the periphery, and focused on his humanity rather than the divine. I loved Ana as a character and the strong women she surrounded herself with. It was wonderful to see both of them realizing their own separate destinies and to go on their own journeys to fulfill them.

I've read reviews where those who disliked the book said that Jesus would never marry someone like Ana. For me, I would have to disagree. I didn't see them as merely husband and wife. I saw them as partners and equals drawn to their own purpose. They supported one another, feared for the other, and complemented each other. Why couldn't Jesus marry a strong, independent, and devoted woman? I thought the author did a great job portraying their relationship, so much so that I found myself rooting for them even though we all know how it ends.

Not only that, but I couldn't get over the world building, the author's ability to seamlessly and casually tie in historical events, and the way the words exude emotion. Ana's frustrations were my frustrations, her fears were my fears, and her grief was my grief.

It's been a long time since I read a book that made me feel so strongly. I wonder if anyone else has had the same visceral reaction to this story as I did.",books,1762

"First page has always been the attention grabber for the entire book but, in that attempt, I've found a lot actually do the opposite by a lot of books starting the same way. They drop you right into the action with no prior knowledge or have a ""you're probably wondering how I got here"" moment. Personally, I've found these types of openings make the opening forgettable by making the opening the middle and filling you in on the beginning later. 

In your opinion, what was the best way a book grabbed your attention in the first page or so?",books,542

"I'm in a wonderful position where I get lots of downtime at work to read. I've kept a little notebook where I write down every book I've read since 2005. Some years have been more productive than others, the fewest being only three for the year with thirty six being the most.

Lately I've been trying to expand my horizons a bit and try different genres and authors. I've notified a trend where I'll follow a large book with a lighter read, maybe to mentally recuperate. Perusing through my recent reads I noticed it was pretty scattershot. They were as follows:

Knife of Dreams ( 11th book in the Wheel of Time series. FANTASY)
The Tower Treasure ( 1st Hardy Boys book. MYSTERY)
The Haunting of Hill House (HORROR)
Flight of the Eisenstein (Warhammer 40k novel. SCIENCE FICTION)
Showdown at Yellow Butte (My first Louis L'Amour book. WESTERN)

I love all sorts of different genre's and it's been great being exposed to so many diverse writing styles. From War and Peace to a Brother Cadfael mystery, World War II history to a Stephen King book, The Gormenghast books to Ray Bradbury and beyond it's like an adventure all its own.

"I don't want to engage on the point of whether it's even morally acceptable to consume the words written by hateful people - I know many people disapprove.

I personally simply work from a ""know thy enemy"" baseline, which is why I'd appreciate it if any potential deeper discussion on whether this is even a worthy thing to do was taken to a separate thread? I personally just wish to know how my oppressors rationalise my existence and what place I occupy within their worldview.

As for the point of the thread, I'd like to keep it fairly technical. Meaning that the key question is - **in this day and age, is it even possible to acquire books in a way which doesn't allow the author to reap any benefit?** For example, ways to avoid contributing to their reception of advertising money, website clicks and views, sales money, etc? Do you know how academic researchers studying terrorism, pedophilia, etc are able to circumvent this problem?

My first thoughts for a road-map of this kind would be:

* Never buy these books from an official bookseller, physical or otherwise
* Only acquire them secondhand, ideally without an exchange of money
* Do authors / interest groups track how many times a given book is checked out from a library or anything of the kind? Do libraries have a method to track when a book is accessed for pure research purposes or for actual interest in/support for the topic? What are library policies on these types of books and would they even be the right place to go to?

Other considerations that are more general/online-focused would be:

* If you need to visit a website, is there a way to avoid triggering an increment in a page view counter?
* Ad money should be easier to withhold, with a decent ad blocker? Is that correct or a misunderstanding of what ad blockers do?

I'd love any thoughts and musings on this.",books,1850

I had a modest upbringing in rural NZ but I felt I could relate to this elite University crowd in New England. The main character fits into a rich friendship group and has to keep up appearances kind of like Harry Potter at Hogwarts, a feeling I think everyone can understand.

I am teaching high school and I have obtained this replacement class (being a substitute teacher is the American term, I believe).

The students have completed the reading of T. Williams' *Sweet Bird of Youth*  with their previous teacher. Today was my first class and it was a bit of a recap lesson.

When I read the book, I understood that the story is taking place in a racist context *but* the main character is underprivileged but still White. At no point in time does the play mention that Chance may be African American. 

My students firmly believe that Chance Wayne is Black. I brought the matter back to my head of department and they agreed that he's definitely not White because why else would he be treated as he is in the text.

I looked it up as much as I can, filtered through some jstor articles and now even I am confused. It's important that it's cleared because the text is on their official syllabus and they will be examined on it for their A-levels.

I offered a compromise that maybe we could tell the students to use the racial ambiguity as a starting point for analysis but avoid treating it as a fait accomplit but my head of department... disagrees

Their entire analysis and critical discussion rest on Chance being African-American.

"From [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41449260-d-day-girls):

&gt;The dramatic, untold true story of the extraordinary women recruited by Britain's elite spy agency to sabotage the Nazis and pave the way for Allied victory in World War II.  
&gt;  
&gt;In 1942, the Allies were losing, Germany seemed unstoppable, and every able man in England was fighting. Churchill believed Britain was locked in an existential battle and created a secret agency, the Special Operations Executive (SOE), whose spies were trained in everything from demolition to sharp-shooting. Their job, he declared, was ""to set Europe ablaze!"" But with most men on the frontlines, the SOE did something unprecedented: it recruited women. Thirty-nine women answered the call, leaving their lives and families to become saboteurs in France. Half were caught, and a third did not make it home alive.  
&gt;  
&gt;In *D-Day Girls*, Sarah Rose draws on recently declassified files, diaries, and oral histories to tell the story of three of these women. There's Odette Sansom, a young mother who feels suffocated by domestic life and sees the war as her ticket out; Lise de Baissac, an unflappable aristocrat with the mind of a natural leader; and Andr√©e Borrel, the streetwise organizer of the Paris Resistance. Together, they derailed trains, blew up weapons caches, destroyed power and phone lines, and gathered crucial intelligence‚Äîlaying the groundwork for the D-Day invasion that proved to be the turning point in the war.  

This month we will be reading D-Day Girls: The Spies Who Armed the Resistance, Sabotaged the Nazis, and Helped Win World War II by Sarah Rose. Sarah will be joining us for an AMA on **Wednesday September 30th.**

"Where did dinosaurs come from? How did they rise to dominate the planet? Why are some dinosaurs so big? Why did some dinosaurs grow feathers and wings and become birds? Why did all the dinosaurs that didn't become birds disappear? Steve Brusatte, a paleontologist who has named more than 15 new dinosaur species, has pieced together a stunning dinosaur epic that traces the rise of this prehistoric behemoth from global domination to its total destruction, using a trove of fossil clues accumulated over the years. In addition, this book vividly tells the true story of mysterious ""dinosaur hunters"" who trace the traces of ancient creatures, leading you to explore the wonderful world of dinosaurs with them.

From the Permian to the Cretaceous mass extinction, from prehistoric Pangaea to the continent torn to pieces, the narrative focuses, from the author's academic career, on detailed and even detailed fossil data, and what's interesting is the way the story is told, vivid and detailed. Note of Impression: 1 The rise of the dinosaurs was helped by the ecological vacuum of the late Permian mass extinction 230 million years ago, when the dinosaurs died in the late Cretaceous asteroid impact. Tyrannosaurus Rex was the top of the food chain on Earth in the late Cretaceous, and if it weren't for the devastating asteroid impact, earth's current owners would say otherwise. 3. The fossils of Sinosauropteryx and other birds found in succession confirmed that birds originated from a branch of dinosaurs and were closely related to Junwang Baolong. Birds are dinosaurs that evolved wings and were able to fly. All living birds are actually dinosaurs. Feathers did not necessarily evolve for flight. One hypothesis is that feathers evolved for physical display or for warmth. Dinosaurs and birds had air bags to breathe",books,1825

Firstly how do i split money correctly? Is there a app or function banks have to allow all money gained from book sales to be split, i want to give the person who does my book cover a split of the revenue from the sales.  
Also what would be a fair split for a book cover?  


Secondly how do i publish a book, i have never published before and im only 14 turning 15 in November so i have no clue how to publish my book and get it in stores and advertise it online.  


Also any tips for how to keep my book good, i am good at book writing but its always good to learn some more.

"I loved the book. The imagination behind it created such a visual in my mind that excited me and pushed me to pursue my own creativity. 

I am posting because I didn't realize there was a movie based off of it. My SO put on the movie and it is NOTHING like the book. To the point where I am so disappointed, this is a ground breaking book that has  had a huge impact on popular culture and it gets a b movie that doesn't even attempt to stay true to the book.

"I try every day. I read about 10 pages of a book and my mind gets diverted to something else. I can't focus for a long time on a book, or anything, for that matter. And it's not like I'm trying to read textbooks, these are books that I know I will like. I'm currently trying to read Cryptonomicon and Steve Jobs' biography.

As a kid, I'd read about 2 books a week. That's turned into 2 books a year now, as much as I hate to admit it. I think I have some idea of the reasons that might be causing this; college schedules, Netflix, social media, and just being so deeply embedded in the digital world.

How do I come back from this? Should I try reading slightly less demanding books to begin with? Because I know Cryptonomicon is one hell of a text. Should I force myself to read every day? I really want to get back to enjoying the time I spent reading books, I don't want to read them for the sake of it.",books,907

"So, I've always enjoyed reading but I've never been a HUGE reader. I'll read a book here or there, maybe 3 per year. Earlier this year, I bought the Sherlock Holmes Collection because it interested me and after I started reading, I was addicted from Day #1. Sherlock and Watson feel so human and the only other character that comes to mind that feels so real is the book versions of Hannibal Lecter. I feel like I know these men intimately because of how human they feel. The mysteries are SO good too and I'm not even a fan of the genre. I have been reading HOURS everyday. I've read 3 of the novels, The Adventures, and The Memoirs and I'm about to start the fourth novel.

"I remember reading a book in my last school year, and i can remember some of the details.

The book is actually really unique.

It's main focus was that at a certain time/age in a person's life, they would be transported to some barren area where wendigo-ish creature's would chase them down and try to grab them, with every second they maintain while touching the monsters transforms them into another monster.

It was also centered around a kind of 'private school' setting like harry potter, but with them constantly training to outrun these monsters and make it back alive.

I also remember a specific scene from the book where students were on a bus, and a student suddenly dissapears, which is how they are transported to the monsters, and the bus needs to go back to the exact place it was when they dissapeared for them to come back",books,840
"I am 19 y/o Indian whose much of the information about the time of 1947 comes from the History books of high school where the topic is discussed in no more than five pages. And even those pages are dedicated mostly to the people in the political echelons of the country. I always wondered how the societies far away from the mainstream freedom movement were affected by the 'independence' that they were provided with. What did it mean to them? I am surprised that I never came across an article or a book that talks about the barely literate villagers, who were probably the majority of the population then, and their perception of the things going on in Delhi.

While picking up this small book, I didn't know that all those questions would soon be answered. As I turned the pages, the fine strokes of the words started filling the blank canvas in my mind with a vivid image, an image which beautifully depicted the season, the village, its people as well as their mentalities.

Even the story itself is a brilliant one, full of suspense as to which character behaves in what manner in such tumultuous times. And even though it comes to an abrupt end, like a wave crashing down after reaching its peak, it left me with immense satisfaction. There were no loose threads, every aspect of the story seemed to have a perfect closure.

Although I am not an avid reader, this book is probably the best of whatever forty books I have read until now.",books,1444
"I am an individual that has dabbled in all kinds of genres of books. Some more than others, admittedly, but I will not apologize for the giant stack of ""Star Wars"" novels I had collected during my teenage years. Nor will I apologize for loving science fiction as a whole. My dad had a massive collection of pulp sci-fi and I loved the look and feel of those yellowy pages and tattered, hand-designed covers. Poul Anderson, Ray Bradbury, and Isaac Asimov were my favorites   though I could not and cannot get into the ""Foundation"" books. So now, as I'm trying to get back into the habit of reading I gravitate towards the genre I love and see ""Hyperion"" on the list. Interesting, I think. Six week waitlist has to mean it's good, I think. When I finally get it I start reading it, leaning into the jargon and the unknown with zeal. 

Now I hate it. 

Let me explain. On one level I can connect to the characters of a book and understand their feelings and their actions, etc. However there are few books that actually make me *feel*, that bring up deep, raw emotion within me. For example, the other thing I read a lot of when I was younger was most of Stephen King's bibliography. For the most part I don't remember feeling horrified or terrified or much of anything when going through his stuff. Perhaps revulsion at some scenes, particularly in ""It""  but that was the most of it. An outlier would have to be his short story ""The Jaunt"". Read it in high school, was promotly freaked out by it  and I am still haunted by it today. 

""Hyperion"" was able to elicit all sorts of visceral emotional reactions from me as I read through it. Back in October of last year I mentioned on another thread that the first ""tale"" of the story &gt;!involving Father Dur√© and the Cruciforms!&lt; was enough to make me stop reading it then and there for how badly it freaked me out. I only really started reading it again at the beginning of August. That's how powerful it was and I was afraid of being hit like that again. Well it did, but while I made myself finish it this past month horror wasn't the only thing the book was able to conjure. 

I pressed on and read through the second and third tales of the book. I was pleased by them, impressed by the way Simmons was able to weave worldbuilding elements into the narrative in a way that let me understand how his take on a galaxy-spanning empire worked. Layer by layer, idea by idea. There were probably things like that in the first tale but I don't remember them. I don't want to.

Then comes the fourth tale, &gt;!Sol Weintraub and his story about his daughter Rachel and their connection to Hyperion.!&lt; This tale **wrecked me.** I connected with the main character of the tale because &gt;!I have two daughters of my own, so the thought of watching the most important person in your life fall into nonexistence due to something that no one can control!&lt; was heartbreaking. I sat and read that tale stonefaced, desperate to get it over while trying not to cry. The whole goddamned thing put me in a dark place for a while and I considered getting rid of the damned book. I couldn't go on, couldn't risk getting emotionally hurt like that again. 

I did it anyway. The part of me that is spiteful and petty won and I dedicated myself to finishing it. And... Holy crap, the last third of the book was amazing. Glorious, written so well that I was shocked and elated to see how the author had continued the worldbuilding he had started before to show how the purpose of the story had been there through each and every tale. I couldn't believe how Simmons had done that, and as someone trying to write as a side job I could only dream of being able to craft something as awe inspiring as this book.

That feeling lasted until the epilogue. You see, I had forgotten that there are three sequels to ""Hyperion"". Imagine my shock and dismay when &gt;!the Final Pilgrimage sets off to their destiny while singing goddamn ""We're Off To See The Wizard"".!&lt; Every bit of positivity vanished. In but a few pages I was expertly blue-balled by that jerk that had frightened the crap out of me twice over. 

I hate ""Hyperion"". It was fantastic... but I hate it.",books,4196

"Hi everyone, 

I just read Dubliners by Joyce, and was interested in other people's thoughts. I read some of it years ago, but didn't remember it well, and what struck me was how classical and simple so many of the stories were. One of the highlights is ""Araby"" which has one of my favorite sentences. "" But my body was like a harp and her words and gestures were like fingers running upon the wires.""  


""The Dead"" is the most famous story in the book, and rightfully so. It feels like a condensed novel in it's fifty-pages, and has many threads to pick at, but I was particularly interested in the tension between Gabrielle's European interests vs. his wife's Irish parochialism. Also, the ending part reminds of both *To the Lighthouse* (especially the end of The Window section) and the film *45* Years*.* 

Just wanted to share my thoughts, and would be interested in anyone's thoughts on it as well.",books,906
"I recently read The Storm Before the Storm, about the fall of the Roman Republic (not the empire) and the events that led to it transitioning from an oligarchy with elections to Augustus being crowned emperor in 27 BC. I couldn‚Äôt help but notice the many similarities from that time period that we are currently experiencing in the US. 

To me, the biggest one is the disappearance of social and political decorum. Niceties and politeness then and now all but disappeared, as did unspoken rules on behavior. 

From the book: ‚ÄúReflecting on the recurrent civil wars of the Late Republic, (Roman historian) Sallust said, ‚ÄúIt is this spirit which has commonly ruined great nations, when one party desires to triumph over another by any and every means and to avenge itself on the vanquished with great cruelty.‚Äù

From constant power grabs to endless infighting to being spread way too thin in constant foreign conflicts, the similarities between the two cultures and time periods go on and on. I encourage others to read this book.",books,1028
"I've been online since 1988, and a crazy avid reader. I love Moby Dick, and I hate [Ready Player One](https://imgur.com/gallery/mzOme) and never finished it. That'll be pretty helpful in knowing where I am coming from, and jokes aside, I don't typically read pulp. I am not sure if it's fair to call Cabin at the End of the World ""pulp"", but it's sort of just how I processed my experience with the book. Namely, that I couldn't put it down, and as a slow reader, I shocked myself that I was able to wrap it up in what seemed like hours vs days.

However, I notice in the last 5 years, namely because of the ""attention economy"", (media &amp; tech fighting for our eyeballs), I'm not like I used to be, and especially since Covid lockdown my attention span is.... non-existent. Rough times, I know.

But that being said, my wife and I were chatting about those books that grip you and take your attention away from reality, and I thought of the Cabin at the End of the World. Whatever it might be considered, I was miles away from reality as I read it, and it really gripped me. I will note that horror movies and games have been quite cathartic during lockdown, as an effective and ""pleasurable"" way to channel anxiety during the pandemic. So of course this book would speak to me, in a sense.

That being said, I'm wondering your opinion of whether a book like this (and Daniel Suarez's ""Daemon"" and ""Freedom"" come to mind as well) could be easily and properly adapted to film? I only ask because these incredibly engaging books come out, the film rights are often purchased prior to even the publication of the book, and it just sits in development hell.

I would love to see this interpreted as a big screen film, and honestly would expect more success with an independent/a24 vibe. I am not sure you talk film adaptations in here very often, but it was just on my mind, and I've got the time! =) Cheers all!",books,1911
"Over the past year, I have fallen in love with the work of John Iriving and Richard Russo. I see them as very similar and very different at the same time. Irving's books are a little more out there, and occasionally have some crazy shit going on.

So far I've read The World According to Garp and A Prayer For Owen Meany by Irving, and Empire Falls and Nobody's Fool by Russo. Of the four, I have to say Nobody's Fool is my favorite. There is no real villain in the book, nothing fantastical, and yet every scene and chapter felt essential. And Sully is just one of the greatest characters I've ever encountered. 

I read Empire Falls after Nobody's Fool. While I absolutely loved it, I couldn't help but notice how frequently Russo repeated themes from Nobody's Fool. The unrepentant asshole father, the well-educated son, the constantly-stressed ex-wife, the somewhat idiotic ""best-friend"" who the main character gives a hard time the entire book, and so on. However, Empire Falls did plenty of its own things that made it wonderful. The whole story with Tick and the gut-punch climax... well, I won't spoil it. The conflict between Miles and Mrs. Whiting was brilliant as well. I have bought Everybody's Fool on Kindle, but I'm not quite sure I'm ready to delve back into another Russo book considering how similar the two books were. I feel like I need a break to get the full value out of it.

Irving is brilliant as well, obviously. I think Owen Meany is one of the greatest characters I've ever encountered in a book. The audiobook narrator did a perfect job with his voice, and I felt like Owen became a close personal friend over the course of the book. Garp was also wonderful - I related to him more than Owen, but I also grew frustrated with Garp's pettiness over the course of the novel. Still, the two books were wonderfully unique and completely different from one another. I look forward to reading a lot more of his work.

After reading these, I tried to read ""Killing Commendatore"" by Haruki Murakami. I had enjoyed many of Murakami's books in the past, but now I felt somewhat frustrated with it. The fantastical elements felt a bit forced, or took me out of the novel. I am still enjoying it for the most part, and plan to finish it, but I find myself missing the dry humor and slice-of-life feel of Russo and Irving. 

So, I suppose my question to r/books is this: what other authors provide a similar feeling to Russo and Irving? Who are the great slice-of-life writers? I've heard John Updike's Rabbit series is great. Are there any women writers who work in this territory?",books,2597
"This has to be the best book I have read so far this year and as of today I have read 67 books. 

This book is written to the author‚Äôs son about his experience as a black person in America so it deals with a lot of heavy topics. I basically cried the entire time I read this book.

Here‚Äôs why I think everyone should read this:
1. The writing was beautiful. Despite talking about topics such as police brutality and gang violence in black neighbourhoods which paints a very bleak and depressing atmosphere, Coates was able to describe these experiences in a lyrical and almost magical way. You could tell from his prose that he is a talented writer and I would go so far as to compare him with the likes of Oscar Wilde, Tolkien and Jose Rizal. He was just that good.

2. Its personal perspective on prejudice against black people. I feel like when we talk about racism, we are often detached from the individual experiences of people who are victims of it. We focus often on the perpetrators and never on the victims. I‚Äôm aware that Coates‚Äô experience is just one of the many black experiences in America but reading from his perspective allowed me not only to make a more personal connection with the author but also made me empathise a lot more on what he and the black community are still going through in America today. Reading about his personal turmoil as a young black kid in West Baltimore because of so much uncertainty, not just from the police and where he lives but also in his school, was heart wrenching. I am so sad to think that many young black people are subjected to this still in 2020.

3. The Dream. You will have to read the book to find out more about this. Suffice it to say, his take on a the ideal of the Dream was extremely eye opening. It gives a new light to how the Dream was created and perpetuated and how unsavoury its history, particularly with black people, was. It gave me a new way to look at it and disillusioned me but I was glad for it. 

I myself am not an American but this book still managed to resonate and evoke feelings from me. I think that no matter who you are or where you come from, this is a book that you can learn something from and that will enrich your soul. 

The only problem with this book is the fact that I don‚Äôt think I can read anything better for a long time. Recommendations are welcome though!",books,2359

One of the best parts about prison‚Äìif you are a reader that is‚Äì is that you‚Äôre finally afforded the time to read all the books you‚Äôve wanted to read but hadn‚Äôt, all the books you should‚Äôve read but didn‚Äôt, and all the books you discover along the way. Sanctions has robbed me of a TV, so I‚Äôve probably never had a more productive streak, reading-wise, save for that first month in quarantine. This list of titles reads like the quintessential English major‚Äôs bookshelf.

Two books have been essential in generating ideas for books-to-read: 1000 Books to Read Before You Die by James Mustich and Nick Hornby‚Äôs 10 Years in the Tub. The former is a compilation of ancient, modern, and contemporary classics of fiction, drama, and poetry, but it also includes memoirs, children‚Äôs/YA lit, and science and history books. I had already read most of the classic literature on its list, but I reminded of contemporary classics like ‚ÄúThe Hours‚Äù, ‚ÄúBeloved‚Äù, and ‚ÄúGilead‚Äù that I‚Äôve been meaning to read for awhile now. All three amazed, especially ‚ÄúBeloved‚Äù. 

I found its science recommendations the most useful, because that is an area I‚Äôm interested in but have no idea where to begin. Being an English major, I‚Äôve always felt that my intellectual blind spots encompassed anything to do with physics or astronomy or chemistry, and especially (obviously, because of my choice of major) economics.

‚ÄúComing of Age in the Milky Way‚Äù was particularly engrossing; it chronicles the scientific discoveries from when the belief of a Earth-centered universe (and the sky as nothing more than a dome) to our modern conception of quantum physics and cosmology, and profiles the thinkers that developed that understanding. But it is in the closing pages where the book transcends the genre; the penultimate chapter mulls the question of extraterrestrial life and puts forth guesses as to where the trajectory of, not just human life, but all sentient life in the galaxy may be moving towards. The book ends with a poetic meditation on our place in the universe, and its spiritual dimensions: modern science recapitulates a major assumption of all major religions.

On the financial reporting side, the Michael Lewis books are serious indictments of Wall Street; he writes nonfiction books like they‚Äôre thrillers. And I think he‚Äôs my favorite nonfiction writer now, with the exception of Michael Pollan.

Nick Hornby‚Äôs book is an anthology of his column from The Believer magazine. There was a lot of overlap with Mustich‚Äôs compilation, but as an established novelist in his own right, Hornby is very knowledgeable of talented writers working today.

My favorite literary discovery of the summer, Jess Walter, also wrote the preface to Hornby‚Äôs collection, and actually, in my opinion, is the far superior writer. His early works are ‚Äúliterary‚Äù crime/noir before expanding into social satire and insightful commentary on How We Live Today. I‚Äôve gushed about him before, but this is me reminding you to check him out. 

Megan Abbott writes literary noir thrillers about teenage girls, who happen to be discovering their sexual powers, that are gripping. ‚ÄúThe Wonder Bread Summer‚Äù is the perfect beach read; a girl steals a wonder bread bag full of cocaine and then haphazardly goes about selling it. There‚Äôs some sex and complaints about men‚Äôs habit of flashing their dicks to potential mates. ‚ÄúThe Family Fang‚Äù is a literary ‚ÄúRoyal Tenenbaums‚Äù, and ‚ÄúV For Vendetta‚Äù totally captivates as it adroitly illustrates graphic novels as a legitimate artistic medium.

The other big surprise was Robert Stone‚Äôs ‚ÄúDog Soldiers‚Äù, which I read because of an inmate‚Äôs recommendation (he also had a copy). A journalist is stationed in Vietnam covering the war when he hatches the bright idea to ship home a few kilos of heroin to his wife, and then distribute it back in the States and make a killing, which was what ‚Äúeveryone was doing.‚Äù His naivety about the drug trade sets in motion a whole shit storm as the whole plan goes awesomely awry. What I couldn‚Äôt believe was 1. the book had won prestigious awards 2. its content was pretty audacious for the time (early 70s) and 3. I‚Äôd never heard of Robert Stone, who apparently had been a member of Ken Kesey‚Äôs acid bus. Now I wanna read ‚ÄúThe Electric Kool Aid Acid Test‚Äù all over again, now that I‚Äôm familiar with some of the major players. 

Hopefully, this hasn‚Äôt been too boring. Considering that you probably have an actual life to live and obligations to fulfill and beers to drink, youd be set with one or two recommendations but I figured I‚Äôd provide you with a list to last you until I see the parole board again.

"Hello all,

I am an author, and a few months back I commissioned a graphic designer to create a book cover for my upcoming novel.

"This is regarding books they only have one copy of, books of which they have 2 or more copies of they still allow 14 days.

But now I can only borrow those for one hour and I have to use their web interface as they've disabled downloading for those books. 

I haven't even seen anywhere where they really explained why they made this change? Anyone that has any more information? What do you think of this change?",books,808
"I started the Game of Thrones series long after watching a few seasons of the show and did my reading experience did not suffer one bit. I enjoyed the books so much more.

However, growing up with the LoTR trilogy of movies has really made it hard to actually pick up the book.

"I read in book in elementary school and I have been racking my brain for years trying to remember the name of it. I have tried googling it, but nothing seems right. So I am reaching out to the reddit community to ease my mind. Here is what I remember. If I remember correctly, the book was about a father leaving his son to look after a cabin while he went away for a couple of years. I also remember him teaching maybe an Indian boy to read in exchange for survival information. Lastly, it seems that he was trying to get honey out of a bees nest and he was stung pretty bad.

""16 October, 1917. The rain starts again. We get the bad news our platoon is going to the front line, with 15 platoon in support a hundred yards to our rear. I have drawn a short straw.

We find our new front line shell hole homes. They are a shallow two foot deep. We are in a nervy position. In front of us, looming as the great giant is Passchendaele. A hill that has cost us many lives.

Hundreds of unburied corpses are spread all about, many floating in flooded craters, trapped in mud, or blown into unrecognisable pieces. The bones of dead men show clearly, picked over by rats and washed white by the rain. This time it appears we have not had the time to bury our own.

Not a sign of nature remains. Every tree lies uprooted by shellfire.

During the night old Fritz opened up in reality, walloping in his 5.9 whizz bangs. His range is right on us. I cannot imagine anyone will be left alive by the morning. It is solid on the nerves. My ears have gone. I have never been subjected to such direct shellfire. I have the wind up.

I am still alive in the morning. I do not know how. I had some of the closest shaves of my life. We cannot move in the daylight. Every slight movement and over they come again. The enemy aeroplanes have absolute dominance.

Showers of rain keep us cold, wet through and plastered with mud. My feet are wet and sore. We are running short of rations. We cannot safely stand up for more than a few seconds.

The day passes slowly with the thought of another night in our minds. In such an exposed position we take heavy losses. I am much in need of our two rum rations. It warms a man up.

In the night it rained and blew while old Fritz shelled us heavily. At some stage a 5.9 comes in right on target, without warning. Our earth home explodes around us. I am suddenly suffocating under the heavy pressure of mud, completely buried by the blast. I think my time has come in a last struggle to push out of this tomb. My thrashing around gets my head out and I scrape the mud off my face for a breath of air.

I have come off best of all. I set to with my spade. We drag two shocked men out alive. The third man, poor Evans, is limp, killed by the percussion. I buried him alongside.

Early the next evening we hear the joyful noise of men ploughing through mud. The 17th Ruahines arrive to relieve us. Only a dozen men of my platoon are left.

Wet to the skin and as weak as kittens from no food we pull ourselves out through the bog. We are on our stomachs negotiating the wire entanglements and shell holes, careful in our condition not to silently sink under and drown unnoticed . We are all angry and snappish at our futile trench occupation. Nobody is speaking."" ***Into the Unknown, The Secret WWI Diary of Kiwi Alick Trafford No. 25/469***",books,2859
"Excellent book. One of my favorite things about it was the fact that Miller was able to keep the story interesting despite so much of it taking place on the island, sometimes the main character being the only person there. There was not a dull moment in my opinion. I used to read a lot but it had been quite sometime since a book had fully sucked me in, I couldn't put it down. The way Miller gave Circe her own story and humanized her was beautiful, prior to this all I had ever read of her was playing small roles in other people's stories. I'm hoping to read more from miller soon.",books,585

I finished *No Longer Human* recently, and I was really impressed with how engaging it was! I especially liked how the author incorporated the photos at the beginning and end of the story. To me, it&gt;! felt like Yozo was sort of a representation of a small part of ourselves personified and separated into one whole character. I'm sure there are many people whose personalities and experiences are very similar to Yozo's, but that was just how I related to it.

"\[So I figured I might get more advice in this community as it is bigger than the Stephen King subreddit, but if this is not allowed please do let me know/delete\]

So yeah. This is my first proper dive into horror. Tried to read Cell by Stephen King before and did not finish it, the pace didn't really pick up and I was bored ‚Äì and it feels like a sci-fi apocalyptic novel rather than horror anyway. But though The Shining also had a slow start, this time the plot actually got me hooked. I care about the characters, and want to know what is going on.

The only problem being, I am getting scared as hell. Last night I read a good chunk (up to the start of Part Three) and literally kept waking up every once in a while because I was too scared to let myself fall asleep completely. Had to fully get up between 5 and 6am to pick up another book that would take my mind off it, and now my sleep pattern is all messed up lol. Needless to say, I won't be reading The Shining before bed again. But I do want to continue.

I know one of the issues for a few people in this subreddit seems to be that King's books are not scary enough rather than too scary, but unfortunately I am not one of those people. How do you guys manage to step away from the world of the book? And how did you come to enjoy horror books, if you weren't a horror novel person in the first place?

Any interesting insight or advice will be very appreciated!",books,1428
"Every bit as good as I remember. For those that haven't read The Bartimaeus Trilogy, it was a YA British magical adventure series that popped up in the wake of Harry Potter. So imagine Harry Potter, but generally a much bleaker tone, offset by the main characters being just ridiculously charming, and the series basically starts just before the Goblet of Fire ""oh god this got serious"" acceleration point.

It's not shy at all that is has things to say about the world although I missed all but the bluntest commentary in high school, and I get the vibe that a lot of it is pointed directly at a British government that was radically different at time of writing. At least to me the story comes across as fairly liberal though, so if you're like me and really upset that J.K. recently decided to declare herself the world's foremost transphobe it's such a breath of fresh air. (Although to be clear, the London portrayed in this novel is basically an outright facist system, just that this is framed as a bad thing, the main character is an idiot for wanting to work within this system, and the inner workings of the government are a snake pit.)

I know this series says right on the cover that it's a NYT Best Seller, but it seems that it was either really low on this list or forgotten after its release since everyone I've ever talked to about it hasn't heard of it. Which is a shame. The series is not without flaw, but it was damn good, deserves to be read, and I wanted to share this bit of my youth with Reddit. If you're the kind of person who'd like to distance themselves from that other series about a talented young wizard in England, I'd recommend giving The Amulet of Samarkand a look. Each book is one Audible credit if you have Audible, and all three paperbacks of the main series are about $30 combined new.",books,1825

"This has been something of a life-long issue for me, but I only started connecting the dots recently. I don‚Äôt consider myself an insomniac by any means as I usually fall asleep fine and will sleep for a good, consistent six or seven hours. Unless I‚Äôm caught up in a real page-turner, then my sleeping patterns get flushed down the toilet until I‚Äôm finished with it. I can‚Äôt figure out why, though.

Take earlier this year. I was extremely invested in a particularly long series, and there was a weeks-long period where I was constantly waking up at around 5am feeling wide awake (no seriously, it was almost always 5am *on the dot*), my mind still racing with thoughts over what I had read before sleeping. Where was the story going next? Was that character‚Äôs actions justified? If I was in that situation, what would I have done? I need to get up at 7am for work, and there were more than a few times where I simply couldn‚Äôt get back to sleep and gave up.

And then it seems to have happened again last night. I picked up a new book over the weekend on a whim (‚ÄòThe Bard‚Äôs Blade‚Äô by Brian D. Anderson, if you‚Äôre wondering) and am nearing the end of it. I‚Äôve been enjoying the hell out of it and am particularly anxious to see how one character‚Äôs arc turns out, but I forced myself to put the book down a little while before going to bed. I hadn‚Äôt forgotten what happened several months ago, and I thought doing this would decrease the chances of waking up in the night. Nope. I woke up around 3am and it must have taken around two hours to fall back asleep. I even took some over-the-counter sleeping meds. It didn‚Äôt help.

What gets me is that, according to my Google searches, reading before bed is supposed to help you sleep, not ruin your chances. I have been completely unable to find evidence of anyone else with this problem, which makes me wonder if there‚Äôs something else going on here. What‚Äôs really odd is that this never happens if I‚Äôm wrapped up in a video game or just watched a good movie before bed. Only books seem to hold this kind of power over me.

My current theory: unlike most movies, a book will place you directly into a character‚Äôs head. You understand what they‚Äôre thinking, feeling, and going through on a deeper level to the point that they end up feeling more like a real, actual person. So when that person goes through some hardships, I wind up feeling genuine anxiety on their behalf which, in turn, keeps me awake at night. Is that dumb? Maybe. But considering anxiety is the only other thing thats had a history of keeping me awake, it‚Äôs the only explanation I can come up with that makes sense.",books,2631
"This is a two fold post: first, to talk about *The Black Dahlia* by James Elroy and to see if you lovely people had recommendations along the same lines (historical crime fiction?) 

Second was to celebrate that I had finished a book for the first time in a long time. I have ADHD and severe anxiety issues. So reading can be ... difficult ... for me to do for any length of time. Between that, a full time job, and other adult stressors, I find that I have not been able to finish reading a book outside of the occasional Graphic Novel in *years*.

I picked up *Dahlia* on a whim (thanks to r/books) for Kindle then in paperback because I hate reading on the Kindle app on my phone. I think a combo of reading actual paper and doing the reading before bed made it easier to do and I think it's helping me sleep better (yes, I know how it sounds).

I have been playing a lot of Assassins Creed Odyssey recently (a video game based in Ancient Greece) and now I want to start reading more about the time period. I think I'm more drawn to fictional literature like legends, myths, gods and divinities from their beliefs. If there are books with a protagonist and a story like Odyssey that would be super cool.

"So, if you might remember, I posted on the beginning of June that I have finished reading Percy Jackson and would go ahead and read **ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE** by **Gabriel Garcia Marquez**, and it took me till August end to finish it. Finally after reading it for days, then ditching it for days I finished it today, and I have one word to say, truly magical. I mean this book is totally unconventional storytelling, but it's the beauty of characters, place and their individual imagination which makes it so remarkable. I mean the layering, event description, it's just wow! 

I don't know how many are like me, who were swooped by the ending. I mean **NO SPOILERS**!, but the complete circle this book travels is truly satisfying. I love such stories with a complete ending, nothing left to say more. I would recommend this book to more matured and regular readers than to a newbie because the language and setup do require some intense visualization.

"Lots of book lovers have one thing in common: we want the full experience. We don't want a translation that cuts half the book, or the light abridged version of a classic.  


I've come across a lot of people asking for the original and complete ""One Thousand and One Nights"". It's only natural: it's a very old book, gone through many translations. People want the ""most faithful"" translation to the original script, and most of all readers try to look for the complete, truly one thousand and one nights book.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me tell you right away: **there is no original ""One Thousand and One Nights"" book**. So, if you're interested in reading this classic, please be aware that you will never find the ""real"" book.

&amp;#x200B;

The popular book is mostly an European work, written by Orientalists (who portrait Middle East societies in a rather exotic way, not always very faithful to the reality). Even modern arabian versions are translations of the European books!  


The ""original"" One Thousand Nights goes back to the IX / 9th century, but no manuscripts have survived from that time. It was mostly a set of different stories, told by street storytellers. It was probably perceived as ""lesser literature"", just a set of folk tales with moral lessons to impress the People. The tales are probably completely different from the ones we have today.

The only thing that connects the ""original"" book and what we have today is how Sherazade told a story every night in order to survive another day. 

&amp;#x200B;

Most of the popular tales (Aladdin, Ali Baba) were added by Antoine Galland, who first ""translated"" the One Thousand Nights and added a few tales that the storyteller Hanna Diab told him. These additional  tales are very likely creations of Hanna Diab and not part of the original One Thousand Nights.

&amp;#x200B;

The ""most ancient"" manuscript of the Nights is a Syrian one. It doesn't have one thousand and one nights. Every single version out there with one thousand and one nights is not remotely original., but something that the translator/whoever published it invented.  


**This is the oldest manuscript of the book:**  [**https://archivesetmanuscrits.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cc31493v**](https://archivesetmanuscrits.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cc31493v)

**If you truly want the ""most original"" translation, the one that follows this Syrian manuscript is probably the best one**. Does it make it the original? No. Who knows, it might not even make it the real one. But it is indeed the oldest one.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously, ""One Thousand and One Nights"" has an incredibly rich History behind it, and I'm not trying to expose that here. And beware, this History is so complex that it really is difficult to point fingers at those who over the centuries published this book.

I just think that most book lovers would want to have this in mind. Lots of publishers claim to have the ""complete"" edition or the ""original"" edition, and I know lots of readers look for that.

  
On a side note, read the book, it's incredibly fun and easy to read (as it was written in a ""popular Arabic"", not the eloquent one)

"I think every character in The Lord of the Rings has a simple abstract speaking pattern
 
you can formulate those patterns with the help of a few concepts that I hope will be intuitive enough (let's *see* if they ring true:)
 
I will quote ""The Lord of the Rings"" and Appendices and ""The Silmarillion""
 
I will quote:
 
- Gandalf + Saruman + Frodo + Sam + Legolas + Merry + Pippin + Boromir + Elrond + Aragorn + Arwen + Gimli + Galadriel + Treebeard + Sauron + Gollum (16)
 
- Gr√≠ma Wormtongue (17)
 
- Theoden + Tom Bombadil + Bilbo + Denethor + √âowyn (22)
 
- Faramir + Celeborn + Haldir + Butterbur + √âomer + Gamling (28)

and I'll also associate 24/28 of the speaking patterns with lyrics writing of some music bands in the comments... [every name is a link to help you navigate the post](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1IbRujko-A)
 
 
[Frodo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V75dMMIW2B4) talks about *strongly/logically connected ""circumstances [most important at the moment]""*
 
*""circumstances""* are special kind of facts, facts telling you about conditions or setup of a situation
 
and ""facts"" are just facts or events
 
""strong connection"" means a logical connection or a somewhat strong repeat/re-frame of already said information or a specific continuation of a thought
 
""most important"" means that you can easily chop the speech into pieces without losing context or meaning, every bit is a self-sustained point
 
""most important"" also means that the character cuts out unimportant info as opposed to speaking about everything
 
- *Why, why wasn‚Äôt it destroyed?* (=) *And how did the Enemy ever come to lose it,* (=) *if he was so strong, and it was so precious to him?*
 
- *I can‚Äôt understand you.* (=) *Do you mean to say that you, and the Elves, have let him live on after all those horrible deeds?* (=) *Now at any rate he is as bad as an Orc, and just an enemy.* (=) *He deserves death.*
 
- *Did the verses apply to you then?* (=) *I could not make out what they were about.* (=) *But how did you know that they were in Gandalf's letter,* (=) *if you have never seen it?*
 
[In dialogue Frodo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V75dMMIW2B4) communicates emotions by simultaneously laying out exposition or by getting hang on something
 
Frodo is a young 50 years old hobbit in the big unexplored world with big potential and curiosity and caring
 
 
  
[Gandalf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V75dMMIW2B4) says speech bites about *circumstances* and *facts* connected by both ""default"" (‚Äî) and explanation/extension connection (~)
 
it (~) means that the next speech bit explains/extends/alters the previous bit
 
""default"" connection is a kind of simple straightforward continuation of a speech or a thought
 
and he makes large accent on *""static circumstances""*
 
an example of ""static circumstances"" is ""I'm eating"", an example of ""dynamic circumstances"" is ""I'm going to get me some food""
 
""dynamic circs"" is something that comes (or came) to a particular event, ""static circs"" is something that does not really lead to anything or is a ""looped"" process or is a state of things or mind 
 
- *Many that live deserve death.* (‚Äî) *And some that die deserve life.* (~) *Can you give it to them?* (~) *Then do not be too eager to deal out death in judgement.*
 
- *It is not despair,* (‚Äî) *for despair is only for those who see the end beyond all doubt.* (~) *We do not.*
 
- *You cannot pass.* (‚Äî) *The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Ud√ªn.* (~) *Go back to the Shadow!* (‚Äî) *You cannot pass.*
 
- (~) *So do all who live to see such times.* (~) *But that is not for them to decide.* (‚Äî) *All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.*
 
Gandalf can leave both the other characters and the reader to backtrack and follow his logic/motivation, he can wall himself off until a conclusion is reached (but after that a revelation may come)
 
[In dialogue Gandalf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V75dMMIW2B4) eliminates options and judgements until only the critical option or judgement is left

**A side note (1):** concepts I describe intersect very much; for a specific quote you often can make multiple descriptions, but if you consider multiple quotes you can see what description ""sticks""/""survives""
 
 
[Saruman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V75dMMIW2B4) talks about *""the most important fact [at the moment]""* and/or an **""outcome""**
 
*""facts""* are just facts or events
 
an **""outcome""** is some relatively major event/effect (good or bad, actual or hypothetical) that changes or sums up the matter
 
- *White! It serves as a beginning.* **White cloth may be dyed. The white page can be overwritten; and the white light can be broken.**
 
- *You need not speak to me as to one of the fools that you take for friends.* **I have not brought you hither to be instructed by you, but to give you a choice.**
 
- **The Elder Days are gone. The Middle Days are passing.** *The Younger Days are beginning.* **The time of the Elves is over,** *but our time is at hand*
 
Saruman has a special vision of the world but has ""nothing to hide"" (when he starts to speak about something)
 
Saruman's pattern is similar to Gandalf's

**A side note (2):** *markings* are just a tool to help you see the patterns
 
 
 
[Sam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V75dMMIW2B4) talks about *circumstances* leading to other *circumstances*
 
also Sam uses both ""explain/alter"" (~) and ""default"" (‚Äî) connections
 
also Sam uses ""explain/alter"" (~) connection
 
(~) can mean a metaphorical 180 degree flip
 
- *All alone and without me to help you?* (~) *I couldn't have a borne it, it'd have been the death of me.*
 
- *I know that well enough, Mr. Frodo.* (~-) *Of course you are.* (~-) *And I'm coming with you.*
 
- *I'm sorry, but you startled me out of my sleep.* (~‚Äî) *And I shouldn't have been sleeping, and that made me sharp.* (~‚Äî) *But Mr. Frodo, he's that tired, I asked him to have a wink; and well, that's how it is.* (~‚Äî) *Sorry. But where HAVE you been to?*
 
Sam pays attention to circumstances on different levels (to concrete situation, to moral side of the deal and etc.)
 
Sam is a principled hobbit that doesn't forget his principles in any particular situation
 
(~) maps to ""hidden"" character and exclusion of amoral options and unsure emotions and defensiveness
 
Frodo and Sam remind me of two my real life friends!
 
 
 
[Legolas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V75dMMIW2B4) talks about *most important circumstances [at the moment]* in multiple parts
 
Legolas is similar to Sam
 
- *He stands not alone.* (,) *You would die before your stroke fell.*
 
- *Yes, they are Elves* (,) *and they say that you breathe so loud that they could shoot you in the dark.*
 
- *I heard them clearly.* (,) *But for the darkness and our own fear I should have guessed that they were beasts wild with some sudden gladness.* (,) *They spoke as horses will when they meet a friend that they have long missed.*
 
[In dialogue Legolas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V75dMMIW2B4) brings attention to the most important circumstances and what is dictated by them
 
he tries to communicate that (""You would die"" and etc.)
 
 
 
 
[Merry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V75dMMIW2B4) talks about **facts** and *""facts indistinguishable from circumstances""* connected by logic
 
*""facts indistinguishable from circumstances""* are something like circumstances created by a fact
 
ie Merry talks vague but occasionally makes a bigger accent on something
 
- *Are we riding far tonight, Gandalf? I don't know how you feel with small rag-tag dangling behind you;* **but the rag-tag is tired** *and will be glad to stop dangling and lie down.*
 
- *I'm sorry, Pippin, but you really must wait till the morning.* *I'll be as curious as you like after breakfast, and I'll help in any way I can at wizard-wheedling.* **But I can't keep awake any longer.** *If I yawn any more,* **I shall split at the ears.** *Good night!*
 
- *I am afraid I was not looking beyond tonight's bed.* **Where and what are Helm's Deep and all the rest of it?** *I don't know anything about this country.*
 
Merry is a hidden strategist and tactician having a big picture in his head
 
 
 
 
[Pippin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V75dMMIW2B4) says speech bites connected by both ""addition"" connection (+) and explanation/extension connection (~)
 
""addition"" is a special kind of connection between speech bites, you are expanding on the thing you already said and it grows like a snowball... or you are ""losing"" your train of thought
 
and Pippin also makes large accent on most important *""static circumstances""*
 
- *That's what I meant;* (~) *We hobbits ought to stick together,* (~) *and we will.* (+) *I shall go,* (~) *unless they chain me up.* (+) *There must be someone with intelligence in the party.*
 
- *I think you must have fallen asleep on your feet and taken the wrong turning.* (~) *When we found that you were not with them, Gandalf sent me to look for you.* (+) *Poor old Merry!* (+) *How glad I am to see you again!* (~) *But you are worn out, and I won‚Äôt bother you with any talk.* (~) *But tell me, are you hurt, or wounded?*
 
- *Well, well, now at any rate I understand poor Denethor a little better.* (+) *We might die together, Merry and I,* (~) *and since die we must, why not?* (+) *Well, as he is not here, I hope he‚Äôll find an easier end.* (~) *But now I must do my best.*
 
""important static circumstances"" may correspond to a comic self-love or a comic vision of the world, like this -&gt;
 
*""There must be someone with intelligence in the party.""* (book) *""anyway you need people of intelligence on this sort of mission, quest... thing""* (movie)
 
[In dialogue/thoughts Pippin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V75dMMIW2B4) gets philosophical about a critical option he already decided or knows

**A side note (3):** do you know about the concept of [Colors of noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colors_of_noise)? A noise can produce any ""sound"" at random, yet there are statistical patterns in the noise! There's an analogy to my concept...
 
 
 
 
[Boromir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V75dMMIW2B4) says speech bites connected by both ""default"" connection (-) and explanation/extension connection (~)
 
Boromir also makes ""little recaps of situations""
 
""default"" connection is a kind of simple straightforward continuation of a speech or a thought
 
(~) means that the next speech bit alters the previous bit
 
- *The Ring! Is it not a strange fate that we should suffer so much fear and doubt for so small a thing? So small a thing!* (~) *And I have seen it only for an instant in the House of Elrond.* (-) *Could I not have a sight of it again?*
 
- *As you wish. I care not* (~) *Yet may I not even speak of it?* (-) *For you seem ever to think only of its power in the hands of the Enemy: of its evil uses not of its good.* (-) *The world is changing, you say. Minas Tirith will fall, if the Ring lasts.* (~) *But why? Certainly, if the Ring were with the Enemy.* (~) *But why, if it were with us?*
 
- *Gandalf, Elrond - all these folk have taught you to say so.* (-) *For themselves they may be right.* (-) *These elves and half-elves and wizards, they would come to grief perhaps.* (~) *Yet often I doubt if they are wise and not merely timid.* (~) *But each to his own kind.* (-) *True-hearted Men, they will not be corrupted.*
 
Boromir is open and honest and bare about his beliefs and their consequences
 
[In dialogue Boromir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V75dMMIW2B4) lays out exposition and yet leaves a place for his own thoughts that may go counter to that
 
 
 
 
[Elrond](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V75dMMIW2B4) talks about *""the most important circumstances [at the moment]""* based around a key fact and uses explanation/extension connection (~)
 
(~) means that the next speech bit explains/extends/alters the previous bit
 
- *But it is a heavy burden.* (~) *So heavy that none could lay it on another.* (~) *I do not lay it on you.* (~) *But if you take it freely, I will say that your choice is righ*
 
- *You at least shall go with him.* (~) *It is hardly possible to separate you from him, even when he is summoned to a secret council and you are not.*
 
- *Look not too far ahead! But go now with good hearts! Farewell, and may the blessing of Elves and Men and all Free Folk go with you. May the stars shine upon your faces!*
 
Elrond has to get to the *core* of any current mess and know what to do about it
 
Elrond thinks very fast but may be unwilling to talk much
 
[In dialogue Elrond](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V75dMMIW2B4) discards unnecessary -&gt;
 
*""It is hardly possible""* / *""I do not lay it on you.""* and etc.
 
 
 
[Aragorn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V75dMMIW2B4) talks about *""the most important fact [at the moment]""* with any connection maybe
 
*""facts""* are just facts or events
 
It is the ""shortest"" and most ""ragged"" pattern possible, every piece of such a talk is a self-sustained point
 
- *But I am the real Strider, fortunately,* (.) *I am Aragorn son of Arathorn;* (.) *and if by life or death I can save you, I will*
 
- *That I feared it too, but less than other things.* (.) *I knew the risk of snow, though it seldom falls heavily so far south, save high up in the mountains.* (.) *But we are not high yet; we are still far down, where the paths are usually open all the winter.*
 
- *I serve no man,* (.) *but the servants of Sauron I pursue into whatever land they may go.* (.) *I am not weaponless.*
 
- *Now I know what you bear.* (.) *Bear it still for me a while!*
 
For Aragorn emotions and logic and goals are the same thing
 
Aragorn is ready to put everything into a one thing and make a sacrifice

**A side note (4):** Aragorn is like [White noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_noise) according to the analogy in the previous note
 
 
[Arwen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V75dMMIW2B4) talks about a **fact** and provides *additional circumstances* to that fact
 
- **Do you wonder at that, Ring-bearer?** *For you know the power of that thing which is now [spoiler]*
 
- **He is ancient in years now, according to his kind;** *and he awaits you, for he will not again make any long journey save one.*
 
- **Do not wonder!** *For the children of Elrond have the life of the Eldar.*
 
[In dialogue Arwen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V75dMMIW2B4) brings attention to facts and evidence surrounding them
 
Arwen slowly unravels (or accumulates) her thoughts and feelings
 
Arwen is very smart and brave person that can hang on an important thing
 
 
 
[Gimli](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V75dMMIW2B4) talks about *""facts""* glued by ""default"" (-) connection
 
""default"" connection is a kind of simple straightforward continuation of a speech or a thought
 
- *Tell me, Legolas, why did I come on this Quest?* (-) *Little did I know where the chief peril lay!* (-) *Truly Elrond spoke, saying that we could not foresee what we might meet upon our road.* (-) *Torment in the dark was the danger that I feared, and it did not hold me back.* (-) *But I would not have come, had I known the danger of light and joy.*
 
- *Nothing, unless it might be - unless it is permitted to ask, nay, to name a single strand of your hair,* (-) *which surpasses the gold of the earth as the stars surpass the gems of the mine.* (-) *I do not ask for such a gift.* (-) *But you commanded me to name my desire.*
 
- *And yet even I, Dwarf of many journeys, and not the least hardy of my folk, cannot run all the way to Isengard without any pause* (-) *My heart burns me too,* (-) *and I would have started sooner* (-) *but now I must rest a little to run the better.* (-) *And if we rest, then the blind night is the time to do so.*
 
[In dialogue Gimli](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V75dMMIW2B4) is extraordinary humble and focuses on facts and on what he just knows
 
Gimli is a pragmatic person
 
Gimli is similar in a way to Aragorn
 
 
 
[Galadriel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V75dMMIW2B4) talks about the most important *fact indistinguishable from circumstances* (1) and uses both ""default"" (-) and explanation/extension (~) connections
 
(1) *""facts = circs""* are little recaps of situations
 
(~) sometimes can be understood as a ""correction"" of an (unvoiced) opinion
 
(-) is a straightforward continuation of a thought
 
- (~) *He would be rash indeed that said that thing* (-) *Needless were none of the deeds of Gandalf in life.* (-) *Those that followed him knew not his mind and cannot report his full purpose.* (~) *But however it may be with the guide, the followers are blameless.*
 
- *Your quest is known to us* (~) *But we will not here speak of it more openly.* (-) *Yet not in vain will it prove, maybe, that you came to this land seeking aid*
 
- *Sleep in peace!* (-) *Do not trouble your hearts overmuch with thought of the road tonight.* (~) *Maybe the paths that you each shall tread are already laid before your feet,* (~) *though you do not see them. Good night!*
 
[In dialogue Galadriel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V75dMMIW2B4) does an immense work of getting everyone on the same page while simultaneously laying out exposition and debunking something
 
Galadriel's emotions are shaped by knowing what a hard work it is
 
and understanding troubles of others
 
Galadriel clearly sees the situation and where it leads
 
 
 
[Treebeard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbfMDwc4azU) has two descriptions
 
(1) talks about most important **""dynamic circumstances""** and most important *""static circumstances""* [at the moment] or a mix of them
 
**""dynamic circs""** is something that comes (or came) to a particular event, *""static circs""* is something that does not really lead to anything or is a ""looped"" process or is a state of things or mind
 
(2) talks about most important ""default circumstances"" (-) and ""explaining/altering circumstances"" (~)
 
(~) means that the next sentence gives a specific explanation of the previous sentence or unusually affects it
 
(-) means just straightforward continuation
 
and the ""most important"" bit means that her speech is kind of brittle/accentuated,
 
you can see it in the short sentences
 
- *Hoom, hm, I have not troubled about the Great Wars,'* (~) *'they mostly concern Elves and Men.* (-) *That is the business of Wizards:* (-) *Wizards are always troubled about the future.* (~) *I do not like worrying about the future.* (-) *I am not altogether on anybody's side,* (~) *because nobody is altogether on my side, if you understand me:* (~) *nobody cares for the woods as I care for them, not even Elves nowadays.*
 
- **But I spoke hastily.** (~) *We must not be hasty.* (-) **I have become too hot.** (-) **I must cool myself and think;** (~) *fur it is easier to shout stop! than to do it.*
 
- **[Spoiler] shall not set foot beyond the rock, without my leave.** (~) *Ents will watch over him.*
 
Treebeard can describe massive changes in life or how the world **came** to a certain *state*
 
[In dialogue Treebeard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbfMDwc4azU) says what he just knows but cares about everyone understanding it
 
 
 
[Sauron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbfMDwc4azU) talks about *most important ""fact indistinguishable from circumstances"" [at the moment]* that explains/alters
 
*""facts = circs""* are small self-sustained recaps of situations
 
and the ""most important"" bit means that speech is brittle/accentuated,
 
you can see it in the short sentences
 
I will believe Pippin's quotations and quote Silmarillion
 
- *So you have come back?* (~) *Why have you neglected to report for so long?*
 
- *Wait a moment!* (~) *We shall meet again soon.* (~) *Tell [Spoiler] that this dainty is not for him.* (~) *I will send for it at once.* (~) *Do you understand?* (~) *Say just that!*
 
- *I hear now that thou wouldst barter with me.* (~) *What is thy price?*
 
Sauron pays attention to chaotic events in the present
 
[In dialogue Sauron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbfMDwc4azU) tries to understand driving forces and costs of the moment
 
 
[Gollum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbfMDwc4azU) talks about **the most important fact** mixed with *circumstances* and uses both ""common circs"" (,) and explanation/extension (~) connections
 
""common circs"" (,) mean different comments about the same set of conditions
 
(~) can mean giving or seeking explanation
 
also pay attention to the brittle speech
 
- **Nice hobbits!** (,) *We will come with them.* (,~) **Find them** *safe paths in the dark, yes we will.* (~) *And where are they going in these cold hard lands, we wonders, yes we wonders?*
 
- **It freezes, it bites!** (,) **Elves twisted it, curse them!** (,) **Nasty cruel hobbits!** (,~) *That's why we tries to escape, of course it is, precious.* (,~) *We guessed they were cruel hobbits.*
 
- **But stream and pool is wet and cool:** (,~) *so nice for feet!* and *And now we wish -* (((DEL!!!)))
 
- *You are not wise to be glad of the Yellow Face* (,~) *It shows you up.* (/next topic:) *Nice sensible hobbits stay with Sm√©agol.* (,) *Orcs and nasty things are about.* (,) **They can see a long way.** (~) *Stay and hide with me!*
 
how it maps back to Gollum:
 
(,) ‚Äî unstable and conflicted
 
**most important fact** ‚Äî obsession with an object
 
(~) - want to dwell on complexes and prejudices
 
 
 
[Gr√≠ma Wormtongue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbfMDwc4azU) talks about *facts* connected by ""default"" (-) and explanation/extension (~) connections
 
*""facts""* are just facts or events
 
(~) means that the next sentence specially explains or ""alters"" the previous sentence
 
(-) means just straightforward continuation of a thought
 
- *Few men would be left to guard your walls, if he had been allowed to rule.* (~) *And even now we learn from Gondor that the Dark Lord is stirring in the East.* (-) *Such is the hour in which this wanderer chooses to return.* (~-) *Why indeed should we welcome you, Master Stormcrow?* (-) *L√°thspell I name you, Ill-news;* (~) *and ill news is an ill guest they say.*
 
- *I guess that it is likely to turn out the same once more:* (-) *you will seek aid rather than render it.* (-) *Do you bring men?* (-) *Do you bring horses, swords, spears?* (~) *That I would call aid;* (-) *that is our present need.* (~) *But who are these that follow at your tail?* (-) *Three ragged wanderers in grey,* (-) *and you yourself the most beggar-like of the four!*
 
- *Did I not counsel you, lord, to forbid his staff?* (~) *That fool, H√°ma, has betrayed us!*
 
[In dialogue Gr√≠ma Wormtongue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbfMDwc4azU) has a twisted tongue
 
he tries to distort the matter and expand his own narrative
 
 
 
 
[Theoden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbfMDwc4azU) talks about *most important circumstances* at the moment connected by ""explain/alter"" (~) connection
 
*""circumstances""* tell you about conditions or setup of a situation
 
(~) describes explanations or changes
 
- *I greet you, and maybe you look for welcome.* (~) *But truth to tell your welcome is doubtful here, Master [Spoiler].* (~) *You have ever been a herald of woe.*
 
- *Dark have been my dreams of late,* (~) *but I feel as one new-awakened.*
 
- *It is said that the Hornburg has never fallen to assault,* (~) *but now my heart is doubtful.* (~) *The world changes, and all that once was strong now proves unsure.* (~) *How shall any tower withstand such numbers and such reckless hate?*
 
[In dialogue Theoden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbfMDwc4azU) is very wise and cautious and feeling
 
he learned from experience how everything changes
 
a person in the eye of the storm listening to changes in the weather but ready for the fair wind
 
 
 
 
[Tom Bombadil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V75dMMIW2B4) talks about *Ho! Tom Bombadil, Tom* **Bombadillo!**
 
- *By water, wood and hill, by reed and willow*
 
- *By fire, sun and moon, harken now and hear us!*
 
Tom is come, Tom Bombadil, for our need is near us!
 
... Where was I? OK now:
 
[Tom Bombadil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V75dMMIW2B4) talks about *facts* connected by explanation/extension (~) and ""common circs"" (,) connections
 
""common circs"" (,) means you comment on the same matter from different angles
 
- *Nay, I didn't hear.* (,) *I was too busy singing.* (,) *And I was too busy admiring this really beautiful doll of myself, since I'm really as self-centered and self-absorbed as can be.*
 
- *He has a big bank account, and quite a few connections;* (,) *and from the Entwives' aging wood, he made worthy logs.*
 
- *Keep on the right of the road - and mind the traffic.* (,) *Don't you speak with Barrow-wights or take rides with strangers.*
 
Tom Bombadil pays attention to now and just-after-now
 
 
 
 
[Bilbo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V75dMMIW2B4) talks about a *fact indistinguishable from circumstances* and uses ""common circs"" (,) and ""explain/alter"" (~) connections
 
*""fact = circs""* is a thing that can serve as a recap of the whole situation
 
for example ""I'm Too Old For This Shit"" - it is both an abstract fact (I'm too old/this is shit) and a description of a concrete situation that encompasses A LOT
 
combination of (,) and (~) connections lets you to say something about a topic
 
and then completely flip the script (or just explain)
 
- *Yes. I am very fond indeed of it, and of all the dear old Shire;* (,~) *but I think I need a holiday.*
 
- *I don‚Äôt know half of you half as well as I should like;* (,~) *and I like less than half of you half as well as you deserve.*
 
- *Yes, I do* (,~) *Though that flash was surprising: it quite startled me, let alone the others.* (~,) *A little addition of your own, I suppose?*
 
[In dialogue Bilbo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V75dMMIW2B4) constantly ""changes angles"" and reveals that he knows more than it seems
 
or **feels** more than it seems
 
Bilbo often have ""two sides"" and wisdom to look at something from two sides -&gt;
 
*""And would spoil my joke.* (,~) *You are an interfering old busybody* (laughed Bilbo)(,~) *but I expect you know best, as usual.""*
 
 
 
[Denethor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2rYRu8UW8M) talks about **the most important fact** at the moment and ""explaining/altering circumstances"" (~) and uses logical/repeat connection (=)
 
(~) means explanation or ""altering"" (flipping the script)
 
(=) means logical connection or a strong repeat
 
- **You were there? Tell me more! Why did no help come?** (~=) *And how did you escape, and yet he did not, so mighty a man as he was, and only orcs to withstand him?*
 
- **Many, many years lie on it.** (~=) *Surely this is a blade wrought by our own kindred in the North in the deep past?*
 
- **You are weary, I see,** (~=) *You have ridden fast and far, and under shadows of evil in the air, I am told.*
 
[In dialogue Denethor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2rYRu8UW8M) holds everything at gunpoint
 
when he speaks you see he already made a lot of deductions or emotional pressure was already build up
 
pure epicness is going on
 
 
 
 
[√âowyn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2rYRu8UW8M) talks about *most important facts indistinguishable from circumstances* and *circumstances* and uses both logical (=) and ""explain/alter"" (~) connections
 
*""facts = circs""* mean little recaps of situations
 
(=) means logical connection or a strong repeat/re-frame
 
(~) can mean undermining
 
- *Too often have I heard of duty,* (=~) *But am I not of the House of Eorl, a shieldmaiden and not a dry-nurse?* (~) *I have waited on faltering feet long enough.* (=~) *Since they falter no longer, it seems, may I not now spend my life as I will?*
 
- *Shall I always be chosen?* (=) *Shall I always be left behind when the Riders depart, to mind the house while they win renown, and find food and beds when they return?*
 
- *All your words are but to say: you are a woman, and your part is in the house.* (=~) *But when the men have died in battle and honour, you have leave to be burned in the house,* (=) *for the men will need it no more.* (=~) *But I am of the House of Eorl and not a serving-woman.* (=~) *I can ride and wield blade, and I do not fear either pain or death.*
 
[In dialogue √âowyn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2rYRu8UW8M) uses logic to undermine status quo
 
she focuses on vague outline of the situation but treats it very seriously -&gt; (her fear)
 
*""A cage, To stay behind bars, until use and old age accept them, and all chance of doing great deeds is gone beyond recall or desire.""*
 
 
[Faramir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2rYRu8UW8M) talks about *most important facts* and uses both ""common circs"" (,) and ""default"" (‚Äî) connections
 
""common circs"" (,) mean different comments about the same set of conditions
 
(‚Äî) just continues the thought
 
Faramir just lays out what he thinks without any flipping of the script
 
- *But fear no more!* (,‚Äî) *I would not take this thing, if it lay by the highway.* (,‚Äî) *Not were Minas Tirith falling in ruin and I alone could save her, so, using the weapon of the Dark Lord for her good and my glory.* (,‚Äî) No. (,‚Äî) *I do not wish for such triumphs, Frodo son of Drogo.*
 
- *I do not love the bright sword for its sharpness, nor the arrow for its swiftness, nor the warrior for his glory.* (,‚Äî) *I love only that which they defend*
 
- *That is well, for I am not a king.* (,‚Äî) *Yet I will wed with the White Lady of Rohan, if it be her will.* (,‚Äî) *And if she will, then let us cross the River and in happier days let us dwell in fair Ithilien and there make a garden.* (,‚Äî) *All things will grow with joy there, if the White Lady comes.*
 
[Faramir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2rYRu8UW8M) is similar to Sam but approaches everything with his principles more openly, reacts to everything with his core without a mask and with full understanding of his own feelings -&gt;
 
*""He read the hearts of men as shrewdly as his father, but what he read moved him sooner to pity than to scorn.""* [(link to characteristics)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faramir#Characteristics)
 
Faramir is like a [positive image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_(photography)) of Gimli and is also similar to Tom Bombadil... or Sam or Aragorn
 
 
 
[Celeborn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2rYRu8UW8M) talks about *facts* and uses both logical (=) and ""explain/alter"" (~) connections
 
(=) means logical connection or a strong repeat or re-frame
 
(~) can mean explanation or a ""take back""
 
Celeborn calculates and explains
 
- *I did not know that your plight was so evil,* (=~) *Let Gimli forget my harsh words:* (=~) *I spoke in the trouble of my heart.* (/another topic:) *I will do what I can to aid you,* (~) *each according to his wish and need,* (~) *but especially that one of the little folk who bears the burden.*
 
- *Maybe not,* (=~) *yet when you leave this land, you can no longer forget the Great River.* (=~) *As some of you know well, it cannot be crossed by travellers with baggage between L√≥rien and Gondor, save by boat.* (=~) *And are not the bridges of Osgiliath broken down and all the landings held now by the Enemy?*
 
- *I see that you do not yet know what to do,* (=~) *It is not my part to choose for you;* (=~) *but I will help you as I may.* (/another topic:) *There are some among you who can handle boats:*
 
[Celeborn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2rYRu8UW8M) has great knowledge of facts but can have unrealised or defensive feelings
 
Celeborn is a close ""relative"" to Gymli and Faramir
 
 
 
[Haldir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2rYRu8UW8M) talks about *most important facts indistinguishable from circumstances* and *circumstances* and uses both ""common circs"" (,) and ""explain/alter"" (~) connections
 
sometimes it seems like he uses ""logic/repeat"" (=) but I think on average it's ""explain/alter""
 
- *That is not well.* (,~) *We have not had dealings with the Dwarves since the Dark Days.* (,~) *They are not permitted in our land.* (,~) *I cannot allow him to pass.*
 
- *Happy folk are Hobbits to dwell near the shores of the sea!* (,~) *It is long indeed since any of my folk have looked on it, yet still we remember it in song.* (,~) *Tell me of these havens as we walk.*
 
- *Some there are among us who sing that the Shadow will draw back and peace shall come again.* (,~) *Yet I do not believe that the world about us will ever again be as it was of old, or the light of the Sun as it was aforetime.* (,~) *For the Elves, I fear, it will prove at best a truce, in which they may pass to the Sea unhindered and leave the Middle-earth for ever*
 
[In conversation Haldir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2rYRu8UW8M) sometimes a little bit reluctantly reasons about a situation
 
Haldir always has A LOT to bring into the conversation
 
 
[Butterbur](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1IbRujko-A) talks about the most important **fact** and *circumstances* and uses both ""common circs"" (,) and ""addition"" (+) connections
 
(+) means expanding on the topic you already said and it grows like a snowball... or you are losing your train of thought
 
- **That's right!** (,+) **Barliman is my name.** (,+) *Barliman Butterbur at your service!* (,+) *You're from the Shire, eh?*
 
- *Now I won‚Äôt make so bold as to suggest you should come to the Common Room tonight,* (,+) **You‚Äôll be tired;** (,+) *and there isn‚Äôt many folk there this evening, anyway.* (,+) *But if you could spare me half an hour before you go to your beds, I would dearly like to have some talk with you, quiet-like by ourselves.*
 
- *Well, if you‚Äôd called for anything else, I‚Äôd have been happier,* (,+) **That‚Äôs just a thing that we‚Äôre short of,** (,+) *seeing how we‚Äôve only got what we grow ourselves, and that‚Äôs not enough.* (,+) **There‚Äôs none to be had from the Shire these days.** (,+) **But I‚Äôll do what I can.**
 
[Butterbur](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1IbRujko-A) is eager to welcome but may be prone to growing worry or lose ""train of memory""
 
Out of all characters Tolkien himself reminds me of Butterbur or Faramir -&gt;
 
*""Long after completing The Lord of the Rings, Tolkien would write that of all characters Faramir resembles the author most, and that he had deliberately bestowed upon the character several traits of his own.""* [(Faramir wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faramir)
 
 
 
[√âomer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1IbRujko-A) talks about most important *facts indistinguishable from circumstances* mixed with **facts** and uses both ""common circs"" (,) and ""addition"" (+) connections
 
*""facts = circs""* mean little recaps of situations

I think the movie perfectly captures patterns of e.v.e.r.y. o.n.e. No matter the other changes in characters
 
So in that aspect, it is perfect cast/writing and a very great powerful book that imprinted everyone right in into the movies
 
Yes, I already have the movie analyzis! But ""translating"" it was a hell lot of work... it was harder than making the original analysis
 
I changed some of the concepts I used and even completely changed some of the descriptions (but it's still 1 to 1 to movies)
 
***
 
I believe those patterns are thinking patterns, they tell (in an abstract way) on what a character focuses on
 
You can view those patterns as different ""exposition roles"", each character tells you something about some layer of the situation
 
You also can try to ""arrange"" those patterns by how much a pattern focuses on a singular/important fact:
 
- Bilbo (absolute 1st) &lt; Gandalf &lt; Tom Bombadil &lt; Butterbur &lt; Celeborn
 
- &lt; Boromir and Pippin and Gimli and Faramir (don't know - how to order?)
 
- &lt; Sam and Merry and Elrond and Treebeard and Gr√≠ma Wormtongue and Haldir (order?)
 
- &lt; Frodo
 
- &lt; Arwen and Galadriel and √âowyn and Saruman and Gollum and Sauron and √âomer (order?)
 
- &lt; Denethor and Theoden and Legolas and Gamling (order?)
 
- &lt; Aragorn (absolute end)
 
You can also view this as the farther you go the more context-independent or conditions-independent or context self-contained or absent of links to outside factors or """"open"""" it gets
 
 
**P.S.** *(this post is* **dedicated** *to real people and old chess players and my love)*
 
I have a **Fool's Hope** too
 
I believe those patterns apply to **real people** &amp; music bands, not only to movie characters
 
So if it is true it is just a **discovery**
 
And I want to **help** people or **save the memory** of them (making this memory **valuable**) through those patterns
 
That is my **Fool's Hope**, if you can understand
 
Maybe you can **test this theory** about speaking patterns with modern day technology such as [GPT-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model)#Applications) or [GPT-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI#GPT-3) - but you can also make human tests
 
It is not the first analysis I'm making, I've made **many more than a dozen** of them already. I wouldn't do it if I didn't believe it to be real or didn't care about the people (the first post was **3** month ago)
 
When I make those analyzes I always remember real people and it **overwhelms** my heart, I am always thinking &amp; remembering about someone 24/7

"I bought The count of Monte Cristo in the amazon kindle store. I'm not sure I got a good copy.

I do not know much about this book. I bought it on a whim because its been praised a lot on here. But the first thing I noticed was that my copy had 602 pages, when all other copies I've looked at usually have around 1200 pages. This must be an abridged version. I'm not opposed to abridged versions, but this seems extreme. 

It cost 0.99 dollars, set down from 6.95. The title reads ""The Count of Monte Cristo (centaur classics)[The 100 greatest novels of all time - #6]

It says ""translater unknown"".
So far I've read 22 pages, and all seems to be in order. I've not noticed any spelling mistakes (though english is not my first language). But still I'm worried I've gotten a ""bad"" copy. The amazon reviews are no help, as they're all about the book in general and not about my specific copy.

"If you haven't read this book, then you're missing out on a true American classic. Author Leopold Butters Stotch's dirty novel about Scrotie McBoogerballs now comes with a bucket because nobody has ever been able to read it all the way though.

This is an amazing book, with some unbelievable imagery. I never fail to be amazed by some of the acts author Leopold Butters Stotch vividly describes in his brilliant novel, although I find that sometimes the imagery is a bit much, especially when it comes to the opening paragraph with the dog and the bloody pus-covered object. Stotch makes up for it with the plot about Amsterdam and the ending with the vaginal frogs sending off Scrotie's infected anus. I enjoy the way Stotch uses Sarah Jessica Parker 465 times in the book as a metaphor for the oppression felt by the lower class, even going as far as to call her a ""transvestite donkey witch."" At such a young age, Stotch seems to exemplify what a political pundit should be. There are two different sides to the raging debate about this book: one side believes that Scrotie McBoogerballs shows how liberals are hurting this country, while the other side believes that Scorite McBoogerballs is the most conservative-hating liberal in literature. After numerous times re-reading this book, along with many unsuccessful attempts to thwart yaking with Pepto Bismol, I have come to the conclusion that McBoogerballs is a conservative. This is the only explanation I have as to why Sarah Jessica Parker's ""buttcheese"" ended up in Scrotie's milkshake. I am impressed with Stotch's slam on health care reform by describing Scrotie McBoogerball's sliding his head up into the horse. These underlined themes are some of the most sophisticated that can be found in American literature, even more than the racism found in the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. If you want to view American society today in an amazing new lens or you just want to read (which is hard to believe, but I'm not here to judge), then The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs is the right book for you.",books,2061
"www.theauthoritarians.org -The author has it online for free on this website.

Hello all, I've just been a lurker here occasionally but I've been doing some reading lately on politics and stuff and I wanted to post this here. A while back while reading some other books like On Tyranny by Timothy Snyder and Fascism: A Warning by Madeleine Albright, I started reading this textbook I found for free online. I got about 70 pages in and had to set it aside. Now I'm revisiting it because it really helped me understand more about how my country (the US) got to be the way it is now.

I just read all the prefaces on the website through, it was really interesting to see these perspectives at different points in time: when the book was released in 2006, an update leading up to the election of 2008 through to the election of President Obama, the actions of the Tea Party in the runup to the midterm election of 2010, a pre-election note from July 2016 about Trump, and finally a note in 2018 in the leadup to the 2018 midterm.

The issues Altemeyer was researching and wrote about are evidently still relevant today and reading even just the most recent note feels weird through a post-COVID worldview (not post as in its over, but post as in the worldview created by the initial incidence of Covid). I recommend reading the original preface and the 2018 note but the other updates provide a really interesting perspective on events of the early 21'st century.

Has anyone here read the textbook before? What do you all think of it?",books,1531

"I was reading through the Ishmael trilogy by Daniel Quinn. I had previously read Ishmael back in school, but not gotten to the sequels, The Story of B and My Ishmael.

Ishmael remains one of my favorite novels of all time, and re-reading it didn't diminish that pleasure. Story of B was very dense compared to Ishmael, but at least it was a side tale, dealt with more religious topics, and ultimately didn't hurt the content of Ishmael.

However, reading My Ishmael, I was absolutely disappointed by Quinn. The ideas were as great as usual, but the main story completely undermined what had happened in Ishmael. There's no way to talk about it without going into spoilers, but it basically turned a heartwrenching plot twist from the original into a happy-go-lucky ending that I felt hurt Ishmael's powerful finale.

"And I am bummed out and sad that there isn't any more. 

For the past few months, reading a few pages of Calvin's shenanigans every day was comforting. It helped me escape the fact that I'm stuck at home.

Calvin was almost always outside, playing CalvinBall with Hobbes, or going sledding, or making absolute masterpieces with his snowman art. Sweet Hobbes never failed to make me look a bit deeper at things and Calvin never stopped believing that anything is possible.

I will miss Spaceman Spiff, Calvin's dad and his insane explanations of how the world works, Rosalyn chasing Calvin to bed, Hobbes pouncing on Calvin whenever he gets home from school, Calvin's battles with Mom's cooking, and the numerous philosophical wagon rides.

But most of all I'll miss the friendship Calvin shares with Hobbes. My favorite volume is ""Yukon Ho!"" because the title story is probably the one that best illustrates the warmth and heart at the core of this comic strip. My heart just glows when I think of Calvin hugging Hobbes.

"I've been a big fan of Paul Tremblay's past work, and the premise of Survivor Song was very interesting. However, I'm about 40% in and I'm really struggling to finish. It's not necessarily a bad book, but it highlighted a problem I have with horror books that seems very common-place.

That is, why do so many authors HAVE to write main characters that are seemingly witty, funny, non-chalant, yet also somehow totally unprepared to deal with some unbelievably horrid situation? Further, why is so much dialogue dedicated to this sort of banter/inside jokes/etc in the middle of unimaginable situations?

Without giving spoilers (I'll just discuss what can be gleamed from the story descriptions/first few pages) the story centers around a rabies like virus that spreads very fast - creating a zombie apocalypse like scenario. The two main characters are a young doctor and her pregnant best friend who are trying to figure out how to navigate being in ground zero of this disease while also dealing with their own personal crisis. 

Again, I'm about 40% in and so far it just feels like 1 giant trope. A young doctor who has little to know idea about the severity of what's going on and is anxious because it's obvious the medical system is not prepared or training staff properly then spends almost all of her dialogue cracking jokes, reminiscing on past escapades in her youth, etc. A pregnant woman in the middle of an apocalypse facing probably the most horrid thing that could ever happen an hour ago joking about having to pee.

I can understand this in your typical Kindle Unlimited 10 part zombie series, but it's seriously frustrating how often solid writers resort to this (especially since Paul has several great books that aren't like this). I get that people handle stress and trauma differently, but the fact that so many horror writers do this and that it is so cartoonishly off tells me that they either don't care or don't bother to learn about how people deal with stress/trauma/anxious situations. 

What do you guys think? Do horror book main characters need to act like Dead Pool-lites/Mary Sues to attract a more wide audience, or should writers actually give characters and their emotions/behaviors some depth?",books,2234
"5. Love triangle - we‚Äôve all seen this one a LOT, i feel like it‚Äôs a go to for many writers (the hunger games, twilight etc.) it‚Äôs essentially 3 characters that are competing for eachothers love. It‚Äôs so painful to watch because there‚Äôs always that clear couple (edward &amp; bella are an example) however sometimes it‚Äôs a little hard to tell but even then you have somewhat of an idea. I give it a 2.5/5 because although it may be sometimes entertaining it is usually overused and just drags the plot for an unnecessary amount of times 
-
4. Best/Childhood...Friends to lovers - very wholesome, it has that beautiful sense of history to go with it. There is just the perfect amount of tension paired with the years of yearning. I love this trope because at first you get to see them build a bond before moving things into a more serious relationship lane . It‚Äôs so beautiful to watch two characters grow together. This gets a 3 or 4/5 because it honestly warms my heart to watch 
-
3. Soulmates - This is usually two people who the universe has paired together and instantly have an undeniable chemistry and bond. Of course it would be absolutely boring if all they did was meet, fall in love instantly and just live happily ever after, which is why i like when writers usually throw a curveball or something of the sort that the pair have to work through which truly showcases how much they belong  together. this gets a 4/5 because i do enjoy a good soulmate au

2. Fake relationships: when two characters have to pretend like they‚Äôre in love to get out of an awkward social situation (to all the boys i‚Äôve loved before) or better yet when they agree to a marriage of convenience in order to subvert the law (Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith) but usually, what began as a fake relationship quickly turns into true love, and i think their rivalry and they unexpected will they/ won‚Äôt they of it all is and the fear of sending mixed singles and not knowing what‚Äôs real or what‚Äôs fake is so exciting to watch. 5/5 it‚Äôs definitely one of my favourites

1. ENEMIES TO LOVERS- my absolute favourite trope( example: pride &amp; prejudice) it is usually two people who hate each others‚Äô guts (sometimes miscommunication or reasons unknown) end up overcoming their differences and angst and ending the story with a (spoiler!) declaration of love. Its so amazing to watch because it have the years of history that the friends to lovers has and also has the uncertainty of the fake relationship especially when they put their differences aside to work together. i am honestly not doing it justice but done write this trope is so beautiful. 10000000/5

"So recently I started reading (really just fiction) and I started with the Lord of the Rings, which led to the silmarillion, and now I'm reading the legend of drizzt series which is like 18 books deep at least. I'm 6 books in and found myself liking these characters way more than I realized when one character was killed off towards the end of book 5. I found myself saying to the author, ""You bastard...you killed em. I actually really liked that character what the hell!!!""

Point is, I FINALLY understand everyone's response to Snape dying all those years ago lolll",books,569
"One of the most insightful books I've ever read. This book should be recommended reading for anyone interested in the brain and how it works.

 Engleman proposes his ideas in this book and does so in a way that feels natural, like he is personally walking you through his thoughts. Many ideas in this books are the fruits of his labour and you can see the passion he has placed in this book, after 10 years of work. 

Engleman mainly focuses on brain plasticity in this book, but there is a twist. He expands on the plasticity concept in a remarkable yet quite simple way. After reading, you wonder why its taken so long for it to catch on, and why it hasn't been fully proposed before. 

This book opens the flood gates for sci-fi ideas to become a reality. And it demonstrates how as humans, we are more in touch with mother nature than we think we are.

I fully recommend this book. 
It might just change your mind...",books,920
"Which opening lines hooked you right in?

Please follow these two instructions when making a reply:

1. The opening must stand on its own. In other words, to be interesting also to people who didn't read the book. Counter example: ""call me ishmael"" from moby dick.

2. It must be either relatively unknown, or simply never got the attention it deserves. I'm talking about the opening only, not the book itself - the book can be as well known (or not) as you wish. Counter example: ""mom died today. Or maybe yesterday, i don't know"" from stranger.",books,546

"Do you ever just read a book so good it changes you in a very significant way?.
Reading has got to be one of the best things that has ever happened to me. Even though I've read alot of books, I'm never really prepared for that ""new book"" glow.

Everytime I read a book so sweet or so action packed I can't help but wish I could just live inside the writers mind, just to witness the magic happening for myself.
I can't help but think, man what happens in that beautiful brain of yours? Are you always in a trance or are you constantly taken by a vision or is your brain some restlessly churning machine?

"How many books do you read? If you have a Goodreads profile it will tell you your year in pages. And also do you work full time, do you watch movies, tv shows, play games? Also do you have a favorite genre? I love fantasy and horror and I like Sci-fi, but sometimes it's just too dense for me.

I see people reading like 100 books, 200 books, 30k pages and I'm like ""HOW???"". 

My recent years:

* 2016: 2271 pages (5 books)
* 2017: 245 pages (2 books) - my worst year
* 2018: 882 pages (3 books)
* 2019: 7473 pages (14 books) - started reading in August and I broke my 2000-2500 pages lifetime record
* 2020: 7541 pages (21 books)

My story:

I'm working full time and I cook twice a day every single day. I also consider myself as a cinephile (love cinema) and I also like watching TV shows (haven't watched for a while). My biggest hobby is playing  games. I've had days with 24 hours of nonstop playing games, but for the last years my average is around 4 hours a day during weekdays and around 8-10 hours during the weekend. Last August I found that I really enjoy reading books (The Stand and KKC series had really huge impact), but I can't read during the day. There are way too many distractions and temptations during the day. So I read almost EVERY night between 3:30-4am and 5-6am since last August (12-13 months ago). And I'm having a blast. Now I can work, cook, watch movies and TV series, play games, watch Twitch, YouTube and read books in bed in complete darkness (tried to read with lights on, it did not work for me).

If you find yourself struggling to read, try my strategy for sure - **go to bed 1 hour earlier and read** (if you have an e-book reader try reading in darkness). Silence helps a lot... at least to me.

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm interested to hear your stories. How many pages do you read per day/month/year, or how many books, or how many hours per day? Everyone has their own way for reading amount estimation. How do you make time to read without quitting watching TV, playing games or other hobbies? It is not a solution for me to quit your other hobbies to make more time for reading. I don't know many people that can successfully combine working, playing games, watching movies/tv shows with reading. Interactive media is too tempting and consumes our time for other hobbies which I'm ok with. I don't want to stop playing games or to stop watching movies/tv series. I just feel lonely in this journey, but for the last 12-13 months I've become really good in reading. I haven't had any  reading slumps and I haven't had any ""bad books"". I find reading really fun for the first time in my life. I've read good books before which I really enjoyed, but it's always been like a chore. For the last year I've had a couple days where I went to bed at 2am instead of 4am to read 2 more hours (until 6am). In other words I've had days where I felt that reading is better than games or movies. I've felt this need of reading when I was reading Wise Man's Fear, Shadows of Self and Words of Radiance. I was so invested in these 3. I always love sequels more. I'm currently struggling a little with Oathbringer and started reading Relic by Preston&amp;Child and I'm having a blast. The writing style is not the best I've read, but the story is so cinematic-like. There are cheasy 1-2-page chapters of a random character being killed by the murderer like it is a movie. But I love the suspense and the mystery. I'm exactly at 50% of the book and I can't wait to finish Relic and get back to Oathbringer. I don't feel this like a reading slump, just a little burned out (I've been reading Cosmere since December 25 2019 until now without reading anything outside it), but I'm still really invested and I love it.

I'd love to read your stories, thoughts and experience with handling work, family, movies, tv, games and other hobbies while reading books.",books,3880
"I've already tried Googling the answer online and it's only confused me further. I have in my personal library, the Signet classic soft cover of Jules Verne's ""A Journey to the Center of the Earth"" (1986) and the Barnes and Noble Collector's leather bound of ""Jules Verne's Seven Novels"" (2006). The texts for what is supposed to be the same story were completely different. They both open to different scenes, have different chapter titles. Even the characters didn't share the same names. I also have the Signet classic soft cover of ""20000 Leagues Under the Seas"" and compared those texts and those were fine, maybe different translations just based on some differences in vocabulary, but why change the names up in Journey? Any Google searches that came up supported the Barnes and Noble version of the text to be the real deal just based on character names which Signet didn't have. Is there a reason for such a disparity between two versions of what should be the same text? Maybe artistic liberty between translations? Which one's right?",books,1044
"I‚Äôve only read two Stephen King books so far, but if **11/22/63** isn‚Äôt considered one of his best, I don‚Äôt really know what else to say. I was immensely moved by this book, and would recommend it to almost anyone. 

The first thing that has to be mentioned is the setting. Even after only two books, I can tell you that King is an absolute master at building places that feel real and lived in. In the case of **11/22/63**, he takes it one step further by transporting us to a real place in history, and it absolutely works. I was not alive in 1963 (hell, my *parents* were only three), but I feel like I‚Äôve been there. This clearly took an immense amount of research, and it shows. 

Realistic worlds are really not worth much, though, if they are not inhabited by interesting characters. I really thought King excelled, here, too. Jake is a likable and relatable protagonist facing multiple impossible scenarios. Sadie is a woman the reader can‚Äôt help but fall in love with (though I wasn‚Äôt crazy about the audiobook narrator‚Äôs voice for her), and of course we get so much insight into one of the most infamous villains in US History - Lee Harvey Oswald. There are many memorable side characters as well, both historical and fictional (including unforgettable cameos by a few King characters from other novels). 

The story is also gripping, aside from a few moments of poor pacing (the reason it took me two months to finish instead of two days). The ending* was so good, however, that I am willing to forgive a few moments of slowness. The book also has more than a few surprisingly beautiful turns of prose, and the time travel element was handled very well. 

Overall, I give **11/22/63** an easy 5 Stars, and recommend it to anyone that loves a great story. 

*Apparently I have Joe Hill to thank for the ending, as according to King he convinced him to change/improve it based on one of his ideas. I guess I need to read Joe‚Äôs stuff too!",books,1946
"Last week, my father and I purchased Stephen King's IT so that we could read it at the same time and then discuss it afterwards.

For context, I am seventeen years old and I'm a big fan of the horror genre.

I have read countless horror stories ‚Äì Lovecraft's work, nosleep stories, and creepypastas¬†‚Äì and I seldom got scared.

After reading 400 pages, I officially declare that IT is my favorite book of all time.

My father, on the other hand, stopped reading after 200 pages as he personally found it ""too graphic"", and he didn't like the ""overly sexual"" scenes.

And then he came to me and told me to hand him my book. Now, I have a good relationship with him and while he never forbade me from continuing, he gave me the ""I trust that you'll listen to my word and not defy me"".

I told him that I didn't take the language seriously and I was content with the creepy atmosphere depicted in the book, but he refused to listen and told me that I'll understand (and thank him) someday in the future.

I don't want to defy my parents but how do I convince them that I'm no longer a child and horror novels ‚Äì whether they're graphic or not ‚Äì are my favorite novels to read. Well, maybe even convince them, at the very least, to just let me finish the novel, especially considering the fact that I reached an extremely engaging chapter.

"First of all, I'd just like to thank this community because I got some fantastic insights last time I was here. The views expressed played a major part in me amending how I approach my work as a video producer for the publishing industry.   
The general consensus was that everyone thought book trailers were dumb and pointless. It confirmed a lot of what I already thought to be true. It seems the general approach to book trailers is anti-marketing.   
I wish I could show you my work on commercials to give you a better context but I don't want this post to be mistaken as a sneaky marketing ploy and be pulled down so instead, I'm going to tell you my new approach to producing a commercial for fiction novels and hopefully gather your thoughts.   
\*\*\*  
1) Where I used to cast actors, I've opted not to portray any main characters in my commercials from now on because I feel that it destroys the world-building for readers.   
2) My commercial spots are now a lot shorter and digestible. When I first began, authors would request commercials that were 1-3 minutes long, and by virtue of this, the video would end up giving away too much of the story.   
3) The style of my adverts is now more abstract and I no longer make commercial spots that depict literal scenes from the book. Again, I feel it destroys world-building for the reader.  
And finally, a question about something I still do:  While I've eliminated the use of actors portraying main characters on screen, I still hire voice actors to narrate the spots, usually an extract from the book. I have them read in character if the story is told in first-person. My logic for this is that generally, people don't seem to mind audiobooks, but as readers, would you find this element distracting? Would you carry the voice you heard in the commercial into your own reading of the book, and would this bother you?   


Thank you for taking the time to read this, I appreciate it.",books,1945

Afterwords we ran from the scene &amp; I shit you not, 2 minutes into walking away and laughing, over on the loud speaker was our principal claiming a lockdown &amp; that it was not a test.. My heart went straight down to my ass.. We managed to walk into a class of different student we didn‚Äôt know. While waiting, everyone was scared &amp; curious on wtf was going on. We heard sirens of cops just outside the window of the class room.. That‚Äôs when i literally knew, they‚Äôre here for me lol. They go searching the school with K9 DOGS ! And about 10-15 officers. School was on lockdown for about almost 2 hours. The only thing that made me feel good was that I had lunch during the time I committed my experiment, and there is no attendance to lunch. They called off the lockdown &amp; I felt relieved ! But there was still cops posted in front of my school and some inside our main office.. Come last period, the cops were still here &amp; I couldn‚Äôt wait to run and hop on my bus to leave home. As soon as I look at my phone to see what time it was, I heard my name and my friends name called upon over the loud speaker by our principal.. There goes that heart leaving my ass feeling again.. I get to the office &amp; about 4 cops were just standing there with our principal, they told us to sit inside the principals office &amp; wait there. Me and my friend, literally scared &amp; knew it was only a matter of time until they fuck us over lol. Our principal enters his office with about 4 cops. He cleared his throat and got straight to it.. He knew we were up to no good &amp; he stated he saw us inside a class room through security cameras... I totally forgot about the fucking cameras lmao. He asked what we were doing &amp; as soon as I was going to admit to hacking all the computers, my friend bursts out saying, we were trying to enter a porn website &amp; got afraid we‚Äôd get caught so we ran.. 1 week suspension for inappropriate behavior.

"A couple years ago, I read Tampa by Alissa Nutting because the Chicago Public Library recommended it based on me reading Ottessa Moshfegh. Everything about that novel just seeped into me. I can still picture the trailer classroom, graphically render the pedophilic sex scenes, and most of all, feel that nasty sense of lust, violence, and manipulation. I read so much of that book on public transportation and was so embrassed/ self conscious. Of course no one was looking, and it was the public library cover art that was just black with the title ""Tampa"" not the superior button hole/ vaginal cover art. 

I felt so... disgusted but exhilirated reading that book? Not because I identified with the narrator, but because it was revolting.

"Kierkegaardian philosophy is inherently Protestant and it depends, in large part, upon your belief in divine revelation. As someone who was raised in a non-practicing Christian household, I was familiar with the story of Abraham and Isaac and I found it easy to dismiss Abraham's behavior as that of a   
delusional mad man. Kierkegaard asks us to take it seriously as the highest demonstration of faith and uses the story to conjure up various Abrahams of flesh and blood and then asks us which of these Abrahams is worthy of being called ""The Father of The Faith"". The biblical text leaves open a lot of room for interpretation. 

Is Abraham: 

A reluctant father who honors God's demand out of fear and submission. (Genesis 22 Verse 12 And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.

An unquestioning disciple who offers his son with a heart full of simple gratitude

A penitent man humbling himself before God's trials (Abraham, after all, has just allowed his first son Ishmael to be cast out of the wilderness and did he not challenge God's judgement 4 times when arguing for the salvation of Sodom and Gomorrah) 

A confident father who is fully willing to sacrifice Isaac all the while knowing that God will not demand Isaac as a sacrifice.

A father who believes fully and completely that he will need to sacrifice Isaac all the while believing that he will still be able to retain Isaac on the ""Strength of The Absurd"". 

The ability to harness the ""Strength of The Absurd"" is faith. Kierkegaard wanted to make the Christian world realize just how difficult it must be to actually have faith. He goes at length to highlight how all the other versions of Abraham would invalidate his greatness. Assuming that we have this kind of cross-eyed Abraham who can at once take all the finite and temporal joy his son has to offer whilst on the path to Moriah fully intending to sacrifice him.

Kierkegaard divides all of humanity into three categories; those of us who are in despair, knights of resignation, and knights of faith. If you lack a defining commitment of the strength of Abraham's faith in God and love of Isaac, you are in despair.  If you have resigned yourself merely to a faith in God without a love of something finite and temporary, you are a Knight of Resignation. If you have both a faith in God and a love of something finite and temporary, you are a Knight of Faith. 

These are abstractions which are difficult to pin down. Kierkegaard goes on at length differentiating the two knights by various qualities. He also argues at length that there are some defining characteristics which distinguish the Knight of Faith from the delusional mad man.

"Carrion Comfort, would recommend.

Finished this book a couple days ago and I enjoyed it. I thought the ‚ÄúAbility‚Äù was a really interesting concept and I loved how it was woven into the world that we know and exist in.

I also enjoyed the how different characters abilities had different characteristics as well as strengths and weaknesses. For example we have Barents much more subtle yet powerful ability, compared to Willis brute force technique.

The last thing I really enjoyed about the book was how it jumped around from povs and characters. For me this made it really interesting because we see situations play out multiple times but from different perspectives. It was fun being able to see which assumptions characters were making were right and which were wrong.
The best example of this is Melanie‚Äôs insistence that Nina lives, even though we know Nina is dead. This really shows how although Melanie is powerful and clever she is also insane.

One of my only complaints about the book was the fast introduction of characters I would have liked maybe a little more space between groups of characters. But that‚Äôs more of a nitpick, overall I had no major problems with the book.

I've heard great things about the Dune series for quite awhile now, including on this sub, and yesterday my boyfriend surprised me with all six originals! I was super excited and started on the first one right away. As of now I'm only 50 pages in, but I'm becoming a little discouraged and the prospect of reading all six books feels daunting. It's very difficult to understand what's going on. I feel like every time there's a noun I'm flipping to the glossary, and many things aren't in the glossary at all.

Their thoughts are always so literal, it completely foregoes the show don't tell rule and drains the dialogue of any tension. 

I don't mean to pick it apart or offend anyone who loves it. I know it's considered a masterpiece of science fiction, but maybe it just isn't for me. So here's my question: did anybody else feel this way when they started reading Dune? And if so, were they able to get past it and enjoy the series?",books,1143
"My father recently suggested it to me, I placed an order for a copy which should arrive in a couple days. 

How did this book change you or your worldly perspective? I‚Äôve been wanting to change my thought process and all around view of the world, what with everything going on.

I‚Äôve read a lot ABOUT this Sage but have never read his work or listened to his teaching before. I‚Äôm very excited for it to arrive and was curious about other readers experiences with this book.",books,473
"Anyone else read this book?

I was excited to read this, thinking it would be some sort of apocalyptic Lord of the Flies. I just didn‚Äôt enjoy it that much. 

I love books with strong, deep character development but that isn‚Äôt possible with this book. There are just too many characters so you don‚Äôt form any connection to them. Most of the dialogue were insults between the children or against the parents. Some could find the Jack character precocious and cute but his character annoyed me. He just happened to learn interpreter-level sign language in a few weeks?!  

The parents are portrayed in an exaggerated negative light. Yes, I understand the generational divide between the children and the parents but some parts are absurd. For example, !the parents‚Äô hostage strategy was threatening armed men with a lawsuit. Or the parents doing coke, ecstasy, and having orgies in front of the kids. A ‚Äúhomeless man‚Äù the children find in the bushes predicts a sickness plague coming and convinces the children to leave with him?!&lt;

The message and theme of the book were interesting but the unrealistic events and characters ruined it for me.",books,1143
"I definitely didn‚Äôt follow it very well the first time, so with extra time on my hands during quarantine I picked it up again.

Am I way off?",books,315
"I‚Äôm not sure if you guys accept comics as books, but I couldn‚Äôt help myself to post this here. I started reading this graphic novel yesterday and burned through all 12 issues. This graphic novel had a cinematic feel to it that no other book has provided for me. The content in this novel is heavy, gritty, and complex while being told in a beautiful and cinematic format. The dialogue is pure gold and the visuals are mesmerizing. From Alan Moore‚Äôs writing to Dave Gibbons‚Äô art, Watchmen has completed elevated the way comics were viewed to another level.

Now I see why Watchmen is on Time Magazine‚Äôs list of 100 best novels. I highly recommend you all read this work of art.",books,676

 Would anyone help explain?",books,345
"I mean I get that literary fiction often has a lot of character development and is not super plot-focused, and the reader gets to learn from the characters' hardships and experiences. But there are sci-fi novels that can allow that kind of character development, too. Also, not all genre plots are predictable.   


I know there are genre fiction novels also listed as literary fiction like 1984 and so on, but I'm mainly discussing books not listed as literary at all. Surely you can learn from them, too!",books,506
"Hi Everyone !

Hope you are doing well &amp; keeping safe.

I have been reading on a kindle for last 4-5 years. What I have noted is when I try to read non-fiction, I am usually unable to finish a book. 

I keep moving between books. Secondly, I also find it difficult to remember the ideas from a particular book. I do highlight, but find the interface to go back and read the highlights to be pretty drab in Kindle.

On the other hand, while reading fiction the experience is as good as reading a paperback. 

Have anyone been in the same boat ?
Any tips/ tricks to get more out of my reading ?

Thanks.",books,605
"Messiah- the promised deliverer of the Jewish nation prophesied in the Hebrew Bible.

The Creator lives in Helios. Helios was worshipped as the sun God in Hellinism (Greek mythology).

Helios is NOT the same as Earth Heaven. 

Helios is Paradise to the Creator and his ‚ÄúGod's‚Äù. This is the home of Hindu Gods. Hindu Gods have control over ALL existence. The human afterlife is the Eternal Earth Heaven. 

ANGELS BELONG TO EARTHS HEAVEN. 

HEAVEN IS PARADISE TO ANGELS. 

HUMANS BECOME ANGELS. 

Love is GOD to humans. Love leads humans to Heaven. 

Angels (spirits) belong to Heaven. 

Love is Allah to a Human Being. 

The Sustainer of our planet is Earth. The sustainer gives us everything that we need. The sustainer sustains life. 

Heaven is the after life. 

Vishnu in Hindu is the Helios Being Gabriel (Jabril). This is who gave the Qur'an to Muhammad.

We must honor Allah and mother Earth.

The sun is Helios. Helios is the Creators Home. The creator is known as Brahma to some; Allah to others... and God Almighty to others. 

The Earthly Heavens are where humans go. We do not go to the Home of the creator (Helios).

Greek mythology refers to the Ancient religion of ancient Greece, dubbed Hellenism. 

The Clouds are Heavens to a human... This is why we must pray to the clouds in the day time. 

Move your tongue while you pray the word ‚ÄúGod‚Äù or ‚ÄúAllah‚Äù , or any other Holy Word. 

It is okay to pray with a Holy Item.

Allah means Almighty God.

Hell is Lucifers home. 

You can not serve two masters. You will either serve GOD or you will serve SATAN. You will love one (GOD and hate the other (SATAN).

¬†In the new testament as Jesus (esus) is becoming crucified he crIes out ‚ÄúEli‚Äù. Jesus spake Ancient Aramaic. Eli is ‚ÄúEllah‚Äù. This is the Islamic word for God. God is Ellah. Allah is Eli. Allah is pronounced any of these ways. God is Eli. That is the pronunciation. Eli is pronounced ‚ÄúELLAH‚Äù (more so accurate than loosely).

The Qur'an says:

¬† ¬†Do not try to be a prophet or a messenger or a saint. A messenger is approved by God for God. The last prophet was Muhammad. The last Messiah Was Jesus (Esus/Isa) and the last Buddha was Guatama. Man should not start war about God. Every prophet is a messenger, but not every messenger is a prophet. 

¬† ¬†Jesus did not deliver scriptures but he was supposed to lead the Jews and he performed miracles. 

¬† ¬†The last Messenger was supposed to have been Jules Verne (1800). Jules wrote of the center of the Earth for a reason. This was because Dante wrote the Inferno (1200) of how the middle of the Earth were Satan and how the layers of the Earth were Hell. We learned of Pergatory from Dante. Pergatory became a Catholic belief. Dante was a messenger. He died after publishing his work ‚ÄúInferno‚Äù and the ‚ÄúDivine Comedy‚Äù works, as Dante wrote his own stories instead of confirming scriptures. Muhammad was the last prophet. Dante was supposed to connect Islam with Christianity. Limbo as stated by Dante is actually the Catacombs of Rome. 

Moses was 1300 BC, Buddha was 550 BC, Jesus was 50 AD, Muhammad was 550 AD, Dante was 1150 AD, Jules was 1850 AD. Notice how each one is roughly 500 to 700 years apart. 

Man was not supposed to know that satan existed because they took advantage of Satan for magics. Magic is evil and results in the game of Satan. 

The Creator, known as Brahma, has many faces because he can see the truth in all situations. From more than 2 perspectives he can see how 3 parties would see the opposite as equally wrong and the creator could see them both as right, even more so for misunderstanding one another since humans are innocent for this type of misunderstanding. 

9000 BC Hindu 

5000 BC Judaism 

3000 BC Hebrew Language

1290 BC Moses (Musa) Introduced the Torah. 

550 BC Buddha Guatama- Buddhism - Introduced many wise scriptures and teachings.

50 AD J(Esus) Christianity (he was to lead the Jews to Christianity and the Jews rejected him) Introduced many teachings. Jesus was the Messiah. 

550 AD Muhammad (he was rejected by Christians) Introduced the scriptures for Islam. 

¬† ¬†I had a dream one time where I seen a blue being with 4 arms. He wore armor and he was over twice my height. He wore armor. He was magnificent. Oh my, it was a sight for my eyes to behold. I felt safe and I knew I wasn't crazy. The sky were blue and the buildings were concrete and gold and there were banners hanging from poles. I was told by a preacher man that this were the false kingdom of God. I believe this were the kingdom of the creator; Helios.

¬† ¬†Eternal references eternity. An eternity never ends. The paradise of Heaven Is not Helios. Angels in the Earthly Heavens fly, as spirits that go from our Heavenly Paradise to Pergatory to help people pass to the after life as well as to purify us for the Eternal Life of Heaven. Humans are supposed to become angels with wings after death. Earths Heavens are seperate from Helios. 

God is sweet for love is the sweetest. ¬†

¬† ¬†A prophet brings the scripture and the messengers confirm the scriptures. Every prophet is a messenger but not every messenger is a prophet. Muhammad was the last prophet. Be not an idol nor idolator. An idol uses magics of satan known as divinity to become God to a human. The engraven image is the thought of how something in our mind. An engraven image is not a statue or the sculpting of totem poles or sculpted busts. You are supposed to pray through Holy items and scriptures, such as crosses and Buddha statues, Paintings of Holy value such as the Last Supper, the star of David, The Islamic crescent moon and star, as well as The Quran and Bible. 

¬† ¬†The idols of Egypt worshipped Anubis as this was a God as in Hindu. For compensation of negative Karma they could become idols worshipped as God. They would not gain entry to the after life of Earths Heaven after becoming idols however. Instead, they coups become born again on Earth. Humans are not supposed to make it to Helios; only to the eternal Heaven of Earth. In Hindu they learned you can become reincarnated as trees because trees are pure and lead sinless lives; yet an extremely long wait. This is a way of becoming accepted into Helios. 

¬† ¬†If a man were to think of himself as a prophet it would cause evil to happen through themselves becoming an idol to mammon. This causes ones Holy Spirit to become blasphemed. 

¬† ¬†The Prophet's and saints promote idolatry through becoming idols to man, as man worship Idols such as prophets and saints. 

The Holy Spirit is the spirit of Love that God Eli gives us when we are created. 

¬†

From an atheist perspective: Love is an aeon in the Gnostic sense. This means that love is an aether substance that we indefinitely know is there because we feel love. It is not an emotion. Love is omni-emotional. Love transcends time and space, thus is eternal.

¬† ¬†Love travels at instant speed. This is the speed of teleportation. It is instant and only what God Allah allows to move at this speed can. Only something permitted with love can travel that speed. The speed of love transmission is teleportation. 

Jesus would focus more on helping the unrighteous as oppose to the righteous. This is the purpose of helping people. There is no need to help those who have been helped. Instead you should help those who need it. 

¬† ¬†Esus (Isa) Is known as the Messiah. His name in Greek is Lesus (Le-Zeus) meaning 'Of zeus'. Esus (of Zeus) name in hebrew is known as Yeshua. This in English transcribes to Joshua. Why do all of these dots connect? God Eli made it this way. Humanity has not failed. 

¬† ¬†Hebrew is not a religion. Hebrew is a language. Jew is not a race. Jew is a member of a religious sector known as Judaism. Muslim is not a race. Muslim is an Islamic practitioner practitioner. These are common misconceptions. 

¬† ¬†The Sun is known as Helios. Hindu originated with worshipping The sun. We were not supposed to do this. Buddha Guatama was Hindu. Buddha Guatama knew God Eli wanted him to incorporate satan (Mara) in to his religion due to Judaism. Buddha Guatama was one of the greatest prophets we have known. 

The concept of Yin and Yang. 

Yin is the black section with the white dot. The white dot represents the good in the bad. 

Yang Is the white section with the black dot. The black dot is a representation of the bad in the good. 

When you combine yin with yang, you have life. 

Helios feeds the trees. The trees give us breath of life. BREATH of life lets us live. This is the cycle of life. 

¬† ¬†The moon is Apollo/Apollyon. Apollo is the gate keeper in Greek mythos and Christianity. The gate keeper blocks us from Helios. This is shown to us during a solar eclipse. The gate keeper is the way to Heaven after life. When we die we are outside of Heaven. When we become pure through the gatekeeper we enter the kingdom. The eternal heaven is controlled by Allah yet we do not go directly to where ALLAH is. Allah is love. Strive to live in LOVE eternally. 

¬† The Clouds are a symbolization of how free and fluid the eternal Heaven is. It is much greater than fluidity, for the clouds are the most pure of water. Only when God is upset does it become fluid... And even then, it is pure. 

¬† ¬†The original religion was praying to the clouds in high pitch hum. Man was offered knowledge of Gods existance. This was the fruit (sweet and nutritious knowledge). The good was religion and the evil was astrology.

¬† ¬†Trees give us the breath of life. In ancient ancestry they respected trees. Why? They give us food and they were big and fun and they gave us shelter from the sun. A family tree is ancient ancestry. Every family had a tree. This is where that saying comes from. We cut trees down like they did us wrong. We are the ones in the wrong... Trees are our natural greatest allies. Mother nature gave us trees as our best friends. Humans cannot even take a full lungs breath of air anymore.

¬† ¬†Mother nature is what controls Earth. Earth is the sustainer and Allah is the creator. 

¬†Allah and his Angels can enter from the spiritual to the physical realm. 

Pergatory is where spirits that do not make it to the after life stay. 

¬† ¬†The clouds in the day time represent the eternal heaven. We can pray to the brightest clouds our eyes could look at. This is what I believe may possibly be a good connection to God, for the light of Heaven reflects off the pure fluid that sustains life; water. 

‚Äúfamily tree‚Äù 

¬† ¬†As humans we do not have to worry about anything, as our family tree would feed us, the same as our family members look over us. Family trees are often associated with Ancient family ancestry now. Probably because families used to have a family tree. ¬†

¬† ¬†Spirits are eternal. Angels are spirits. Love is eternal. Love is the essence of what God gave us. Spirits are what we become when we die. Spirits and Elis Babies. Mammon are Elis Pets. The Beings of Elis palace are Elis children. Mammon has taken advantage of Elis amazing grace. Eli is often times too forgiving And mammon takes advantage of this.

¬† ¬†Mammon is not always innocent. We are animals who evolved spiritually Initially, then we devolved in the religious sense, thus devolving spiritually since the introduction of religion (Because we went against religion.) We only evolved after learning that Eli existed ¬†Then we went against Eli (Allah). After that we devolved in every aspect. Life spans are shorter and we have no natural instinct. We are a dying species. We cut down trees that gice us the breath of life and we pollute the atmosphere of Earth. Earth is the sustainer. We must treat Earth well. Earth naturally gives us everything. We breathe out the breath of death and trees produce the Breath of death at night time. We have too many people and not enough trees. There is not enough breath of life to support us all. This is why we cannot take deep enough breaths to fill our lungs. 

¬† ¬†The rest of the universe cannot enter Helios (the Sun). God has allowed the palaces that enter and exit the sun to observe the universe to teleport. Allah is king of the universe. 

¬† ¬†God is the light. That is why it may be a good idea to pray to the clouds lit up in the day time. Our eyes can handle day lit clouds. 

¬† ¬†Mammon can not stare in to the sun without going blind. We cannot behold the awesome light of God Almighty, the creator of the Universe. The enmity between The Universe and the Creators Home, the Sun, Helios, prevents anything from entering the creators kingdom. The enmity feeds the universe. Heaven is protected completely. 

¬† ¬†Humans were not supposed to know that satan existed. Humans took advantage of this knowledge of evil. 

¬† ¬†The knowledge of good was to know that God existed and the knowledge of evil was to know that Satan existed. 

¬† ¬†The Creators Angels have Floating Palaces that are shaped like Octagon palaces that move through teleportation. They control the palaces with their spirits. They pilot the palaces with love. These floating palaces belong to the Creators Home, The Sun. These beings in Hindu are Angels. 

Hindu predates every known religion. ¬†

We must unify one religion.

¬† ¬†I have had realistic vivid dreams of Lucifer and demons. Lucifer looked pale with white hair and he was old. I have seen him 3 times in dreams. I have seen a female succubus that tried to seduce me also. 

¬† ¬†You must pray every morning. It only takes a few moments to pray for Elis protection daily. Just a short, meaningful prayer. Just 2 or 3 sentences is all it takes for Elis protection. Eli is pure and gives the most pure of love. 

¬† ¬†We must avoid idols. Do not accept becoming worshipped. Do not worship mammon either. Idols are people who become worshipped as God. People are not God. 

¬† ¬†Heaven (Helios) controls the eternal Paradise we move on to. God would never make a human suffer through anything they wouldn't get something back from or did not deserve. 

¬† ¬†Reincarnation is when you die and are born again. When we die we get to live again if we do not make it to heaven. In Hindu we learned of reincarnation. We become born as a new life organism. It is to be born again as recompense for your karma so that we may live eternally. We are supposed to go to the eternalHeaven after life though. 

¬† ¬†Helios is the power plant of the universe and it is protected from everything evil. 

¬† ¬†Jesus was Arabian. Hebrew is known as religIon yet it is a language. Judaism is known as a race yet it is religion. Islam (Muslim) is known as a race yet it is religion. Muslim was evilishly associated with the Arabian race. There is no set religion or language for a race. Jesus spoke aramaic. Aramaic is ancient Arabic. Jesus was Arabic. Aramaic is a language. Language was confused with religion and then religion was confused with race. Jesus (Esus/Isa) was Arabian (race) and his religion was jewish. Esus (the second 's' is silent) is how his name was pronounced. Isa (eey-suh).

¬† ¬†The Holy Bible: Jesus (Esus (Isa in the Quran)) called out for &amp;QUOT;Eli&amp;QUOT; as God. Eli is pronounced Ellah. Ellah is the Aramaic name for God. Allah is the name of God in Islam. Jesus (Esus or Isa) was Arabic. He spoke aramaic and had the same NAME for God that they do in Islam and Judaism as well. Esus was jewish as well. He was a Jewish Arabic. Just because certain groups have a different name for God does NOT mean that it is a different God. There is one God. We should honor all religion. Just because you have a different name for GOD does not mean it is a different God. There is one God: The Creator. Just because you call out to God in a different way than I do does not mean he is not still listening to both of us. He knows we both argue over what to call him also. God is always listening. He knows all that we think and all that we do. Religion is the renaming of God and the retelling of how-to follow him. It is the same God (There is only one) with multiple different groups of people calling out to him with different names. You can not label God with a word. You must reach out to God by prayer to the brightest clouds in the day time. That is the original knowledge of good. That is the original religion of mammon. 

¬† ¬†The Quran says not to be a saint because people will worry to worship a saint as an idol. The Quran says not to be a prophet as people will try to worship a prophet. This is because the messenger will end idolatry by showing the world God is real by connecting connecting the scriptures. Thus, the Quran has dots that connect and say that the next messenger will not be a saint. The messenger who brings all the scriptures together will not be a prophet. He will speak against idolatry. Everybody can be that messenger. All you have to do is become approved by Allah. 

¬† ¬†The rewriting from Hebrew to English of the holy bible quoted idolatry as worshipping holy items. Idolatry is worshipping idols. idols are people who worship satan to become God. Avoid idols. 

¬† Idols are not items. Items are not idols. 

¬† ¬†God Eli is happy when we are happy, not when we try to be saints so that other people will think that we are saints. We should live and have fun. That is what life is about. Eli doesn't want us stressing about being good. Eli wants us to be happy because Satan cannot touch us. Don't try to be the GOOD person for the BAD reason... reputation does not gain you entry to Heaven. The actions you commit go further. As does your will and your reputation with God. 

¬† ¬†The new covenant must be brought together through one unified religion for the planet. This is done by connecting all religion where God Eli puts each vantage point. 

¬† ¬†The blood of the covenant goes further than the water of the womb. This means that those who you shed blood with in battle will be your brothers before your actual siblings. You will be closer with your war mates than your actual family. 

¬† ¬†The New Testament of the Bible says that (J)Esus cried out ‚ÄúEli(Ellah)‚Äù. 

The main priority is connecting different scriptures where they are all the same. Each scripture is of the same God because each scripture is from GOD. A prophet is trusted from God. That is how you know that each Scripture that has been delivered has been sent from God. 

¬† ¬†Muhammad traveled in a Glaring palace that traveled teleporting through the universe. The palaces travel at love transmission speed. 

Jesus was not a Prophet because he did not deliver scripture, yet he was just as important. He did many works to show people God were real and he was supposed to lead the Jews. 

¬† ¬†Luciferian worship is based around idolatry. This is the worshipping of mammon as God, such as the Egyptian Pharoah. When Egypt was ruled by Pharoah, Moses strayed them from idolatry. Moses warned them of idols. They were told not to worship mammon (humans). Lucifer (satan) tempted man to wishworship one another through idols. Now people claim they are God and worship famous people. Humans disobey God and worship the engraven image in their thought of how they see God. The word ‚ÄúGod‚Äù is worshipped as the image of what is portrayed as God in a persons thoughts and it is idolatry as some worship humans as they think of the word ‚ÄúGod‚Äù. It is blasphemy. You should not accept idols nor becoming accepted as one. 

¬† 

A quote from myself telling another what I had seen:

¬†I seen a blue being in a dream one time with 4 arms and I believe they are Otherworldly beings. Definitely immortal. I heard a voice in my mind a couple months later say &amp;QUOT;Hindu&amp;QUOT;. I was convinced what I had seen was an angel. I looked up Hindu angels. They call him Vishnu. He was muscular and let me know I were safe. There were beings marching in a parade and the sky was blue and there were concrete buildings. It was beautiful. 

James 1:13

Let no man say when he is tempted that he is tempted of God; God tempts no man. God can not be tempted either.

¬† ¬†This means that when you are tempted, the temptation never comes from God. Eli never tempts as he is pure love and nothing tempting comes from love. Temptation is the negative side of what seems as desires; drug use and prostitution are examples. 

¬† ¬†The Bible says that whenever a Christian has to suffer for no reason if they do not go against God they will receive a reward for their good karma. This is how Hindu has applied in modern abrahamic religion. 

¬† ¬†There is only one God and he is sweet. God is not mean nor is he vengeful or wrathful unless you are an enemy. ¬†God is forgiving and very sweet. If you observe the scriptures, you learn valuable information. You must pray before you read the scriptures and read the scriptures slowly. 

¬† ¬†Prayer is one way to find out of God. You build a relationship with God and he will guide you. 

¬†The Bible is a history of humanity. 

¬†The Quran is Sciences of God and descriptions. 

We need to connect the dots between the 2. This will unify a singular religion. 

¬† ¬†Guatama Buddha is looked at as a prophet in Islam because he unifies Hindu into a religion that incorporates the belief of Satan (Mara). Hindu was supposed to migrate to buddhism as Judaism was supposed to migrate to Christianity. God wanted these religions updated for the newer generations as times have changed. Now we have Islam and it will help incorporate every other religion into one through the practical Sciences of God. 

There will be evidence of Christ and Christian beliefs will also be widely accepted as Christianity is what Judaism evolved in to. Buddhism is incorporated into Islam and Christianity has incorporated into Mormonism. 

Scientology can help unify the facts of these religions. 

Luciferian religion is the use of magic of Satan to control mammon through idolatry (divinity). 

¬† ¬†Yeshua is the same tongue movement as Isa (Esus).

How new spirits are made

_____________________

¬† ¬†The beings in the creators home (these are considered God to the eternal paradise; Vishnu, ¬†Shieva, and beings of the same varieties) have a pricess of combining the two of their souls (between a male and a female) called ‚Äúsoul mating‚Äù. This creates a new soul. For the two Angel Gods, they figure out everything about one another's spirit and they feel a lot of love and joy. This creates new spirit essence to give to new life. Praise to the Creators Home! Praise to Helios! Praise to the kingdom of God!

Paradise is eternal for it lasts an eternity. 

Quote sura 53 from the Qur'an

[53:1]As the stars fell away. (Because it was day light, there were no stars out)* *53:1-18 Muhammad was summoned In front of the highest of the universe (AN ANGEL OF ALLAH) to receive this Quran into his heart. (A being of HEAVEN allowed muhammad to know what the Quran says bevause muhammad was illiterate.) The stars fell away (BECAUSE IT WAS NOT NIGHT IT WAS DAY LIGHT AS THE SUN WERE OUT) as he (Vishnu, Gabriel, Jabril) traveled through the sky (THE DAY SKY HORIZON) at millions of times the speed of light (From the sun on a palace controlled by LOVE). Subsequently, the Quran was gradually released to his memory (Knowledge in his mind. Muhammad could not read so Jabril let him know what all the qurans information held). [53:7]At the highest horizon. (From out of the sun)ÿ´ŸèŸÖŸéŸë ÿØŸéŸÜÿß ŸÅŸéÿ™ŸéÿØŸéŸÑŸëŸâŸ∞ [53:8]He drew nearer by moving down. (From the sky)ŸÅŸéŸÉÿßŸÜŸé ŸÇÿßÿ®Ÿé ŸÇŸéŸàÿ≥ŸéŸäŸÜŸê ÿ£ŸéŸà ÿ£ŸéÿØŸÜŸâŸ∞ [53:9]Until He became as close as possible. (Vishnu lowered the palace) ŸÅŸéÿ£ŸéŸàÿ≠ŸâŸ∞ ÿ•ŸêŸÑŸâŸ∞ ÿπŸéÿ®ÿØŸêŸáŸê ŸÖÿß ÿ£ŸéŸàÿ≠ŸâŸ∞ [53:10]He then revealed to His servant what was to be revealed. (Vishnu gave Muhammad the Qur'an.)

53:11 the mind never made up what it saw. (This is a reference to his MEMORY quoted as the KNOWLEDGE of his MIND, as Vishnu gave him memory of all the quran says since muhammad couldn't read.)

A palace controlled by Vishnu presented itself in the sky to Muhammad and gradullay floated to the ground and gave Muhammad the Qur'an and since muhammad could not read (because he was illiterate) Vishnu (Jabril) allowed Muhammad to understand all thr information in the Quran. 

I have seen one of these Palaces. 

53:13-18 Muhammad saw the palace in another episode (another movement) (it says descent in the English version yet I believe it means to ascend as in to go up.) AT THE ULTIMATE POINT (THE HIGHEST POINT, HEAVEN) Where the eternal paradise is located (HEAVEN OF ALLAH) And the whole place (Muhammad, as he was by himself) was overwhelmed. The eyes did not waver nor go BLIND. (MUHAMMAD SAW THE PALACE ENTER INTO THE SUN. THIS IS WHY MUHAMMAD WAS OVERWHELMED.) MUHAMMAD saw great signs from THE LORD ALLAH (AS HE WERE LOOKING INTO THE SUN.) Allah did not let Muhammad go blind as he were looking into the sun. The sun is Gods Home. 

There were no stars out because Muhammad received The Quran in the day time. This is evidence that nuhammad recieved the quran in day light as he saw the palace enter the sun. 

THIS IS OVERWHELMING AS WE NOW KNOW THAT THE SUN (HELIOS) IS ALLAHS KINGDOM. (ALMIGHT GODS KINGDOM)

The Quran had been created before the book had been given to Muhammad And Allah knew exactly how it would all go.

The sun is Heaven. 

¬†

¬†

¬†

¬†

The Eternal Paradise. 

There are angels that look lile humans in the eternal heavens of earth. They have wings and they fly but we never can see them. They guard us and keep us safe and they work for Allah. They protect us from evil and keep us from satan. The good angels of God are so special to humanjty and they keep us safe. They can be Grim reapers when they enter the physical realm or they can be Something that orevents bad from happenkng or give you advice through another human speaking to you. The eternal oaradise is the greatest thing a human could imagibe. We all go to Heaven when we die. It is the greatest thing. We all go there. Nobody goes to Hell. God wouldnt make us go to Hell. We would Have to be Satan to go to Hell. Only the worst of the worst in the after life get put in Hell. That is why it is best to not go against God once you get to the after life. God is sweet and kind and forgiving. God has somebody who punishes you also if you go against him. We should honor love completely ¬†Love is what brings many people sanity. 

¬†

¬†

¬†

In Islam it is a sin to hit somebody's face. 

When it mentions to strike in Islam it is referring to scold with words. When the Quran said to punish your wife by leaving her in bed and striking her, it means resist having sex with her and scold her with words. Why? Man has dominance over the wife. The Bible also speaks on this. Here is am example from both the Qur'an and the Bible:

Quran 4:34

Do Not Beat Your Wife* [4:34]The men are made responsible for the women,** and GOD has endowed them with certain qualities, and made them the bread earners. The righteous women will cheerfully accept this arrangement, since it is GOD 's commandment, and honor their husbands during their absence. If you experience rebellion from the women, you shall first talk to them, then (you may use negative incentives like) deserting them in bed, then you may (as a last alternative) STRIKE THEM (TO SCOLD THEM). If they obey you, you are not permitted to transgress against them. GOD is Most High, Supreme. *4:34 God prohibits wife-beating by using the best psychological approach. For example, if I don't want you to shop at Market X, I will ask you to shop at Market Y, then at Market Z, then, as a last resort, at Market X. This will effectively stop you from shopping at Market X, without insulting you. Similarly, God provides alternatives to wife-beating; reasoning with her, then employing certain negative incentives. Remember that the theme of this sura is defending the women's rights and countering the prevalent oppression of women. Any interpretation of the verses of this sura must be in favor of he women. This sura's theme is &amp;QUOT;protection of women.&amp;QUOT; **4:34 This expression simply means that God is appointing the husband as &amp;QUOT;captain of the ship.&amp;QUOT; Marriage is like a ship, and the captain runs it after due consultation with his officers. A believing wife readily accepts God's appointment, without mutiny.

Peter 3

English Standard Version

Wives and Husbands

3 Likewise, wives, be subject to your own husbands, so that even if some do not obey the word, they may be won without a word by the conduct of their wives, 2 when they see your respectful and pure conduct. 3 Do not let your adorning be external‚Äîthe braiding of hair and the putting on of gold jewelry, or the clothing you wear‚Äî 4 but let your adorning be the hidden person of the heart with the imperishable beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which in God's sight is very precious. 5 For this is how the holy women who hoped in God used to adorn themselves, by submitting to their own husbands, 6 as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord. And you are her children (YOUR CHILDREN WILL BE AS THE MOTHER RESPECTS THE FATHER), if you do good and do not fear anything that is frightening.

7 Likewise, husbands, live with your wives in an understanding way, showing honor to the woman as the weaker vessel, since they are heirs with you[a]¬†of the grace of life, so that your prayers may not be hindered.

THESE EXCERPTS ARE PERFECT FOR COMPARING TO ONE ANOTHER. THEY SAY THE SAME THINGS INITIALLY. 

PETER 3:7

Husband have to honor their eives as the weaker of the 2, as tje man is the captain of the vessel, and the woman is the weaker vessel; yet they are one flesh. They are one vessel. 

QURAN 4:34

The men are captains of the marriage and have to respect their women AND have to defend women's rights. They are one flesh. They are one vessel and the man is the captain. 

NOTICE HOW BOTH EXCERPTS STATE THE MARRIAGE IS A VESSEL (SHIP) WITH THE MAN IN CHARGE.

PETER 3:5-6 States that the HOLY WOMAN will accept the man as in charge AS SARAH obeyed Abraham calling him LORD.

QURAN 4:34 THE RIGHTEOUS WOMAN WILL ACCEPT THE MAN AS THE SUPERIOR.

Also, in other versions of the Quran it states to abandon your women in bed and to strike them if they disobey you. Any time the Qur'an states to strike it refers to SCOLD with WORDS because it is a sin to hit somebodys face in Islam. To abandon your woman in bed means to not have sex with her as punishment. 

When the Qur'an states such of war it refers to Warfare of the Holy Spirit. Violence is a SIN!

#:#:#:#

THE MISCONCEPTIONS IN BOTH THE BIBLE AND THE QURAN

The Modern Quran states it is okay to Beat your wife. The initial approach was that it is okay to SCOLD your wife when it gets too serious. THIS MISCONCEPTION NEEDS TO BE FIXED.

The Bible has stated that IDOLATRY is the worship of items. Idolatry is the worship of humans. Stay away from idolatry. The engraven image is the thought of something in your mind. THIS MISCONCEPTION NEEDS TO BE FIXED. 

ALLAH IS THE ALMIGHTY GOD

ADULTERY is having sex with more persons than the one that you are with (seeing, dating, married to). There are different levels to how serious adultery can be. You should not have sex just to have sex until you are married, yet this is not as bad as HAVING SEX WITH ANOTHER OF THE OPPOSITE SEX WHILE YOU ARE MARRIED. 

HOMOSEXUALITY IS A SIN BECAUSE MAN WAS NOT MADE TO HAVE SEX WITH MAN. A MAN CANNOT GET ANOTHER MAN PREGNANT. A WOMAN CANNOT GET ANOTHER WOMAN PREGNANT. ALLAH WILL NOT HATE YOU BECAUSE OF HOMOSEXUALITY BUT ALLAH WILL HATE THE DECISION TO DO HOMOSEXUAL ACTS. YOU ARE NOT DEFINED BY THE DECISIONS YOU MAKE. 

Do not Honor how you try to be or how you see yourself; honor where you are from and take pride in GOD/ALLAH. THIS WILL HELP YOUR SANITY. 

ALMIGHTY GOD KEEPS PEOPLE SANE AND RESTORES THEIR SANITY. 

ALLAH IS VERY FORGIVING. ALLAH IS THE GOD OF JESUS (ESUS) AND ALSO ABRAHAM. SOMETIMES IT TAKES TIME FOR ALLAH TO FORGIVE. HOWEVER, WE ARE ALWAYS FORGAVE, BECAUSE WE ARE ONLY HUMAN. 

TO MURDER IS EVIL. MURDER IS CONTEMPLATING ON KILLING ONE BEFORE COMMITTING THE ACT. THIS IS WORSE THAN KILLING ONE OUT OF ANGER IN THE MOMENT. KILLING ONE ON ACCIDENT IS NOT AS BAD YET YOU SHOULD STILL TALK TO ALLAH ABOUT THIS. KILLING ONE ON ACCIDENT COULD BE A CAR ACCIDENT. KILLING ONE OUT OF FRUSTRATION OR ANGER ON THE SPOT WITHOUT TIMR TO TAKE BACK THE THOUGHT IS AN ACT OF EVIL AND IS WORSE THAN KILLING ON ACCIDENT. MURDER IS FAR WORSE THAN KILLING OUT OF ANGER. THE ONLY FORM OF KILLING WORSE THAN MURDER IS TORTURING ONE TO DEATH. IF YOU KILL ONE INTENTIONALLY ALLAH WILL PUNISH YOU. HUMANS ARE NOT INNOCENT WHEN THEY DO THIS. 

IT IS A SIN TO COMMIT IDOLATRY. TO BECOME AN IDOL OR AN IDOLATOR IS EVIL AS THIS IS BLASPHEMY. 

TO COMMIT TO EVIL IS AN ULTIMATE SIN. 

TO USE ALLAH/GODS NAME IN VAIN (FOR NO REASON, WITHOUT CAUSE) CAN BE VERY SINFUL. IF YOU BLASPHEME THE NAME OF LOVE/GOD/ALLAH, IF YOU KNOW BETTER, ALLAH WILL PUNISH YOU. 

THE WARFARE ALLAH AIDS US WITH IS SPIRITUAL WARFARE. HE WILL PROTECT US IN BATTLE WHEN WE ARE INNOCENT YET WE SHOULD AVOID VIOLENCE. 

LOVE IS NOT SEX. DO NOT TURN THE IMAGE OF ALLAH INTO SEX. YOU SHOULD NOT SEE SEX WHILE PRAYING TO GOD. THIS IS BLASPHEMY. 

LOVE IS GOD/ALLAH TO A HUMAN BEING. PROTECT LOVE. LOVE IS THE ESSENCE OF SPIRIT ALLAH GIVES HUMAN BEINGS WHEN WE ARE CREATED FOR NO REASON. 

DO NOT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ALLAH. LET ALLAH HANDLE THINGS. 

DO NOT REPEAT YOURSELF THROUGH PRAYER AND DO NOT PRAY LONG PRSYERS SAYING THE SAME THINGS OVER AND OVER. THIS MAKES ALLAH UPSET. YOU SHOULD ONLY SAY MEANINGFUL PRAYERS. 5 SHORT, MEANINGFUL PRAYERS A DAY IS MORE THAN PLENTS. THAT IS ONLY A FEW MOMENTS FOR EACH PRAYER. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO REPEATEDLY ASK FOR FORGIVENESS EITHER. GOD WILL FORGIVE AFTER YOU CONFESS YOUR SIBS AND ASK FOR FORGIVENESS (REPENT).

HONOR SCRIPTURES SUCH AS THE TORAH, THE VERDES, THE BIBLE, THE QUR'AN, AND THE BUDDHIST TEXTS. 

AVOID SATAN/LUCIFER/MARA/THE DEVIL AND STAY AWAY FROM DEMONS. 

DO NOT USE TELEPATHY BECAUSE YOU ARE ONLY TALKING TO THE THOUGHT OF THAT PERSON. YOU MAY BE TALKING TO A DEMON WHEN USING TELEPATHY. 

DO NOT TALK TO SPIRITS. YOU MAY BE CONVINCED YOU ARE TALKING TO A SPIRIT AND IT MAY BE A DEMON. 

AVOID MAGICS OF SATAN. Avoid VOODOO AND DO NOT PERFORM WHITE MAGIC (DIVINITY) NOR BLACK MAGIC (WITCHCRAFT) NOR GREEN MAGIC (SHAMANISM AND DRUIDRY) NOR SORCERY. DO NOT ENCHANT ITEMS AND DO NOT PERFORM ALCHEMY AS THIS IS OF SATAN. AVOID SPELLCRAFT. 

SPEECH CRAFT IS EVIL ALSO. DO NOT CONVINCE OTHERS THROUGH AN OTHERWORDLY INFLUENCE. DO NOT LIE AND DO NOT TAKE SIDES OF ONE WHILE DISHONORING THE OTHER PARTY, AND THEN HONOR THE OTHER PARTY WHEN YOU ARE AROUND THEM. ¬†

HONOR EVERY PERSON AS YOU HONOR YOURSELF. THIS IS BECAUSE YOU CANNOT LOVE ANOTHER PERSON UNTIL YOU LOVE YOURSELF. ANOTHER WILL NOT LOVE YOU UNTIL YOU LOVE THEM ALSO. THIS IS WHY YOU HAVE TO LOVE YOURSELF; THEN YOU CAN HAVE FUN. 

KEEP YOUR ESSENCE OF LOVE SAFE. 

A friend is somebody who is your ally; you two are of the same covenant (team) and help one another. A team is a group that are of the same clan, tribe, army, family. 

Romans 6:3

God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?

If you know you will die because of what you do, then why would you continue to commit the sins you do? This is an example of negative karma coming back on a person.

ANCIENT HELLENISM (GREEK MYTHOLOGY) AND ANCIENT JUDAISM (REFERRED TO AS HEBREW MYTHOLOGY)

Greece is a place. Mythology from the ancient times in the place of Greece is known as Greek mythology. The place of Greece is often times confused with a religion. Ancient Greek religion was effectively ancient Hellenism. 

Hebrew is a language. Hebrew mythology refers to ancient Judaism. Hebrew is not a religion. Hebrew is not a race. Hebrew is a language. 

Ancient Greeks practiced astrology as well as religion and ancient Jews found astrology Normal to the Greeks, Yet for themselves the ancient jews knew it were a sin. The ancient greeks found out about Gods and other parts of the sky from worshipping the night sky as well as the day sky. 

Ancient jews practiced religion. Ancient Judaism was the practice of prayer to the bright lit day skies. It made sense to them that Helios was the Sun God in Ancient Greek Hellenism since the sun lit up the clouds bright. Ancient Jews knew to pray to the clouds in day time yet they also knew to avoid worship of the night sky. Ancient jews knew that greece worshipped the night sky and this is why So many Ancient Greek philosophers are remembered as great astrologists. Yet, Hellenic is not as widespread as Judaism today because of how astrology is a sin. Astrology took us from religion. 

In Hindu they worshipped the sun as God and found out about Gods kingdom through sacrificing good karma to find out information through knowledge of evil (astrology). 

Whenever a prophet came about to spread word of Judaism they told of how we were not supposed to give in to the evil temptation to know of Allah's place. We are only supposed to worship the day lit sky. This is when we found out of angels that fly in the after life. Judaism was adapted in Greece and then the Greeks followed astrology snd found out about other things we are not supposed to know.

How to pray: 

Many people doubt orwyer because they pray and it does not work. Here is good advice: when you pray, move your tongue. However, do not move your tongue while thinking. To move you Holy Tongue while thinking is called idolatry. To move you Holy Tongue while saying a meaningful prayer is POWERFUL as this is what GOD LOVES. 

Do not pray without moving your tongue. 

Move your tongue while you pray. Pray the word of your deity. 

Yoh channel your Holy Spirit when you move your tongue while praying. 

Written by a devout Christian. 

I pray to Jesus Christ. 

It is all the same.

Love is God. Read your corresponding scriptures and pray the word of LOVE everyday. Follow the commandments and rules of LOVE also. Do not go against LOVE. LOVE is GOD. 

This is how religion connects. There is much more to it. Spread the word.",books,37983

"I just finished phillip roth's *The Plot Against America* and man, it felt to me like it could have been written today. Many, many passages felt enunciated some of my own feelings on current events better than I ever could. A few of my favorites:

&gt;Turned wrong way round, the relentless unforeseen was what we schoolchildren studied as ""History"", harmless history, where everything unexpected in its own time is chronicled on the page as inevitable. **The terror of the unforeseen is what the science of history hides, turning a disaster into an epic.**

As a guy with a history degree, I love this. There's also a passage in which the father explains how history is just the chronicle of everything happening around us, wherever we are. Very insightful, imo.

&gt;Never in my life had I so harshly judged any adult-not my parents, not even Alvin or Uncle Monty-nor had I understood till then **how the shameless vanity of utter fools can so strongly determine the fate of others.**

This line is in reference to the narrator's aunt -a jew who has become a supporter of the Lindbergh administration- meeting with von Ribbentrop at the White House. I think it speaks for itself.

A few others that stood out to me were most of Winchell's dispatches, both on the radio and then on the campaign trail; la Guardia's eulogy of Winchell; and especially Mrs. Lindbergh's radio address indicting the Wheeler presidency and the Republican collaborators, especially this bit: 

&gt;I will not yield to or be intimidated by the illegal representatives of a seditious administration, and i ask no more of the American people than that they follow my example and refuse to accept or support government conduct that is indefensible. The history of the present administration is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of absolute tyranny over these states.

I bought the book about a month or two ago and I‚Äôm having the hardest time getting through it. At first I was flying by the chapters letting myself get sucked back into the world of the hunger games but after a few chapters the book has become so dull and boring to me that the further I get into it the more it feels like a chore and I find myself losing focus and having my mind wander off. I‚Äôm on chapter 26 and honestly have lost track with what‚Äôs happening after Coriolanus met up with Lucy in the meadow. Although there were parts that I found enjoyable like when the hunger games FINALLY started getting some action thrown in but I find Coriolanus Snow to be so abrasively pathetic and annoying that I wonder why Suzanne even chose to tell this point of the story through him. I find myself wanting to give up on reading it but I just want to finish it already.

"I recently read Sam Harris' ""Letter to a Christian Nation,"" and I will provide my take on it here. I am an atheist. However, I believe there is a LOT to learn about our universe that may forever remain as mysterious unknowns.

I used to grow up in a household that practiced Judaism, and I eventually diverged into becoming an atheist. Sam Harris' book highlights every reason and more that eventually convinced me to make the switch (Harris' book wasn't what changed my mind. I switched many years ago). I thought he was very objective, logical, convincing, and diverse with his arguments.

If you are religious and have read this book, I'm very curious as to how it may have changed or solidified your outlook on the world.

Sam Harris' general argument, as I interpreted it, was that there isn't any present, logical evidence that would lead to concluding that Christianity holds any truth (in regards to the mythology. Sam makes sure to note that there are many great lessons about morality and community that can be derived from the bible, but he is only concerned with the mythology component).

If you haven't read this book, I highly recommend you do. It's barely over 100 pages and reads easy. I am always a supporter of learning more about the beliefs you disagree with, so I'd recommend this to anyone with any religious affiliation. 

This thread is not intended to be a book review, so I have made [a video](https://youtu.be/WJfDC5w3PM4) reviewing this book if anyone is interested.

"Shakespeare's Coriolanus dramatizes the rise and fall of Caius Marcius (Later known as Coriolanus) from hero to outcast. It is one of Shakespeare's most controversial plays. Critics have remarked on the seemingly comic nature of this tragedy while deriding its eponymous hero as a bloodthirsty brute. 

Coriolanus, through his disdain for plebians, demonstrates the kind of anti-democratic rhetoric that has become so popular for fringe right agitators. Yet Shakespeare manages to make Coriolanus a sympathetic character, despite his odious and violent nature. After being banished for having too much pride (because the crowd was riled up by envious senators), Coriolanus unleashes this speech at the fickle crowd: 

You common cry of curs! whose breath I hate  
As reek o' the rotten fens, whose loves I prize  
As the dead carcasses of unburied men  
That do corrupt my air, I banish you;  
And here remain with your uncertainty!  
Let every feeble rumour shake your hearts!  
Your enemies, with nodding of their plumes,  
Fan you into despair! Have the power still  
To banish your defenders; till at length  
Your ignorance, which finds not till it feels,  
Making not reservation of yourselves,  
Still your own foes, deliver you as most  
Abated captives to some nation  
That won you without blows! Despising,  
For you, the city, thus I turn my back:  
There is a world elsewhere.

Coriolanus anticipates much of the rhetoric we've been hearing across the political divide. It's hard to read ""Your ignorance, which finds not till it feels"" without conjuring up an image of Ben Shapiro's  nasally-voiced ""facts not feelings"" memes. In an era of ""outrage"" culture how can we not acknowledge how we have ""Let every feeble rumour shake your hearts! Your enemies, nodding of their plumes fan your into despair"". Are the left not guilty of ""banishing our defenders"" by choosing to ""cancel"" whoever does not fit neatly into party lines on every issue? Doesn't the right now believe still that we are in a great invisible war which America is losing to nations that win ""without blows""?

Yet doesn't Shakespeare make it quite clear the Coriolanus is unfit to be ruler? He is bloodthirsty, mean, and doesn't he, ironically, show some of the same fickleness as the plebians by choosing to change sides and wage wars against the very same Rome which he built his pride on defending? The only thing unchanging about Coriolanus is the pride which he unable to swallow. Should such a man as this be leader of Rome? Coriolanus, by remaining honest to a fault, allows Rome to remain a Republic. We see what happens when a man like Coriolanus also knows how to play the crowd. We get Julius Caesar, the downfall of the Roman Republic. 

So what are we to learn from ""The Tragedy"" of Coriolanus? We see at once the defense of The Roman Republic comes at the price of the banishment of its most ardent defenders. There is a kind of ideological bent towards Plato's order of regimes. We move, by various shifts, from an Aristocracy (rule by the best) to a futile and fickle Democracy where people worship freedom to the point of Anarchy only to be replaced at last by Tyranny. So while the right attempts to ""Make America Great Again"", presumably by returning power to an unlisted aristocracy isn't there yet chaos on the left as the fight for freedom has led to anarchic violence in many big cities. 

We know very little of Shakespeare's personal political opinions. Harold Bloom suggested that perhaps Shakespeare was no more egalitarian than his bloodthirsty creation Coriolanus. It is clear, however, that he had no respect for crowds. In act I, scene I Coriolanus gives us our first insight into his opinion of acquiescing to crowds:

He that will give good words to thee will flatter

Beneath abhorring. What would you have, you curs,

That like nor peace nor war? the one affrights you,

The other makes you proud. He that trusts to you,

Where he should find you lions, finds you hares;

Where foxes, geese: you are no surer, no,

Than is the coal of fire upon the ice,

Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is

To make him worthy whose offence subdues him

And curse that justice did it.

Who deserves greatness

Deserves your hate; and your affections are

A sick man‚Äôs appetite, who desires most that

Which would increase his evil. He that depends

Upon your favours swims with fins of lead

And hews down oaks with rushes. Hang ye! Trust Ye?

With every minute you do change a mind,

And call him noble that was now your hate,

Him vile that was your garland. What‚Äôs the matter,

That in these several places of the city

You cry against the noble senate, who,

Under the gods, keep you in awe, which else

Would feed on one another? What‚Äôs their seeking?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Let's assume the Hegelian account that tragedy is the struggle between two goods. What do you guys think of this character? Is Coriolanus a villain or a hero? Does Shakespeare make a compelling argument for both the plebians and the patricians? Is this kind of rhetoric really still popular in contemporary politics or do I overstate my case with these two speeches?",books,5154
"I'm curious as to whether or not people can relate to this:

I love fiction and non-fiction. I find them both to be eye-opening in a variety of ways, not all of which overlap. However, after recently reading many non-fiction books consecutively and then transitioning into reading fiction, I've noticed it's much harder for me to ""get into"" a fiction book compared to a non-fiction book.

I'm assuming this partly has to do with the requirement of world-building and character introductions. I just feel like the ball in my brain starts rolling on page one of non-fiction but page 100 for fiction.

"I've read Hawking's ""A Brief History of Time,"" ""Brief Answers to the Big Questions,"" and ""The Grand Design,"" all of which were phenomenal. However, I think Brian Greene's ""The Elegant Universe"" takes modern physics literature to a new level.

This book was phenomenal. Brain Greene's ability to manipulate the English language and create vivid images of inherently counterintuitive ideas is mindblowing. After every few pages, I'd just lay in bed and stare out my window, trying to fully comprehend the beautiful artifice of the ""reality"" we interact with on a daily basis.

General relativity, quantum mechanics, and string theory are all complex, challenging scientific fields. However, Greene was able to explain them in lay terms as well as I think an expert could.

I've never read anything that has made me ponder my existence more. 

If you are at all interested in physics or the workings of the universe, I highly recommend this. It is by no means an easy read; string theory can only be simplified to a certain extent. Conversely, this is by no means a physics textbook. It is very much a *story*.

If there are any physicists who can answer my questions regarding this book, I'd love to hear your thoughts:

1. Could photons be oscillating between ""photon"" and ""antiphoton"" states in which the two annihilate to create darkness (a different take on the wave-particle nature of photons)?
2. Are white holes just black holes in which the fabric of space-time hasn't been distorted (e.g. if a black hole mass pops into existence, would the mass expand outwards like a white hole)?

If anyone developed any other crazy physics ideas from this book, I'd be very curious into hearing them and having more qualified physicists on this sub weigh in. 

I'm very curious if people who have read Hawking and Greene agree or disagree as to which they liked more!

"Hi! To get straight to the point, I‚Äôm not new to reading but recently (i.e. the past several months~the past year), I‚Äôve noticed that when I try to read something, whether it be novels, short stories, comics/manga and even TV shows, I have a difficult time immersing myself in a story and truly investing my emotions into it. I feel like something inside me is blocking my emotional response to the story, so I have to ‚Äúforce‚Äù myself to feel for it but it ends up being counterproductive and results in me feeling like crap for now enjoying a story well enough. 

In simpler terms, reading to me now feels like scrolling through a reddit feed, mindlessly and apathetically looking at word past word until I end the chapter and realize that I don‚Äôt remember what I read on the previous page. 

This is the first time this has happened to me, and I‚Äôm extremely concerned and quite afraid of what this may lead to and if it means I can never delve into the world of literature again. I used to be able to empathize, laugh, be on the brink of tears for a story for god‚Äôs sake. I used to be able to surround myself in a world I felt like I was part of while being by the side of characters whom I thought of as real people. 

Now, I just flick through pages, panels, scenes and forget them quickly, even if said story is objectively very good and is something I would have loved before. Now I have to try and claw whatever semblance of emotion I know I am supposed to feel from the story out of myself.

¬†You want to confide in your friends to tell them what just happened. You need them to help you make sense of it all. But you second-guess yourself: you know they won‚Äôt understand. You feel like they would judge you.

¬†So, you suppress your feelings and act like everything is okay. But with every passing second, it‚Äôs harder to function. It‚Äôs harder to breathe.

¬†A nagging feeling ‚Äî a quiet inner voice ‚Äî tells you to try Jesus. So that‚Äôs what you do.

¬†But you find it hard to speak to Him‚Äîthe words simply won‚Äôt come out. You reach for your notebook and a pen and begin writing to Him instead. 

¬†You‚Äôve never done this before. And a part of you questions if He truly cares. 

¬†But what if He does? What if He writes you a letter in return? A letter that challenges every thought and emotion you have. 

¬†In ***Dear God‚Äôs Daughter: Words of True Love When False Love Fails****,* Tonya shares her personal experience on how she healed from a toxic relationship with the help of God through Jesus Christ. 

¬†She writes her story from the perspective of you‚Äîthe reader‚Äîmaking this your own intimate journey with Jesus, the Son of the living God. 

¬†Accompanied by biblical verses, this devotional will help you to:

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† identify what an unhealthy relationship looks like;

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† see yourself through Jesus‚Äô eyes when it comes to self-love, self-acceptance, and forgiveness;

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† know God through His Son;

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† feel confident as you transition into your single season;

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† discover who you are and the importance of purpose;

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† and prevent and/or stop the cycle of toxic relationships within your life.

"More and more, I‚Äôve been noticing how much cheaper my new releases are on Kindle compared to print. On average, it‚Äôs $8 or $9 cheaper, and that‚Äôs even going from Amazon‚Äôs lower print price, not the considerably higher print MSRP. The reason for this post is that I just checked a new JFK book that comes out in September: $14.99 on Kindle vs. $38.49 for Amazon‚Äôs print price ($40 MSRP). FWIW, I read mostly non-fiction, so I have no idea if the same disparity holds true for fiction.

Anyway, my post question is one I‚Äôm really curious about. Would the industry prefer doing away with print? With such glaring price differences, it seems to be the case.",books,653
"From around age 9-13 I started reading novels, starting with Stephen King and eventually John Irving, Leonard Cohen‚Äôs ‚ÄúBeautiful Losers,‚Äù Nietzsche philosophy books, George Orwell, a few other things like that.

Part of my interest in these books was a childish desire to be seen as mature, but they did appeal to me intellectually. What I could grasp at the time, anyway.

I realize now that there was surely much depth, humor, etc. from these works that went completely over my head. I‚Äôm sort of interested to re-read some of them now that I‚Äôm older and wiser.

I‚Äôm curious if anyone else had this kind of experience with books when they were a kid.",books,651
"(I have not finished the book) 

As i was reading this book a thought came to me. I was wondering if others felt the same or just me.  One of the main topics or ideas from what i am reading is to let people talk. It says that people love talking about themself, and if you let them they will like you. Although i do agree it made me think about myself. I hate talking about me. whenever i have a conversation with someone who lets me talk the whole time, i feel annoying after. I feel cringe and awkward next time i see them. Anyone else expedience this? Do you think it‚Äôs common to feel like this or not?",books,605
"So I've just finished this book, I only started reading it yesterday but I couldn't seem to put it down once I picked it up lol. 

As someone with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), this book really resonated with me. I was honestly in tears by the end of it because it included all of the difficult parts of being autistic and it truly captured the way so many autistic minds function, but even with the difficulties and the lack of emotional depth, Christopher was still portrayed as a strong, passionate, independant character with his own aspirations and hobbies and perspectives. So many books and TV shows and movies either romanticise autism as if it's some sort of magical gift or portray autistic characters as incapable or stupid. It made me really happy to see an accurate portrayal, where an autistic person didn't just immediately know everything about his special interests, but continued studying them even when I didn't have to because he enjoyed them. It made me really happy to see that even though he didn't express his emotions in the same way most people do, he still had them and he still showed them in his own way. So many autistic characters are created that somehow are 'genius savants' without ever having picked up the information from anywhere, or they've been written to be useless by someone who doesn't understand WHY we have meltdowns or detatch sometimes. 

What really got me though was the fact that his condition was never mentioned anywhere in the book. He just described himself as 'special needs' whilst also describing people with glasses or other 'special needs' in the same way. The book wasn't focused around his condition because this story was about him, and he didn't need to give his mind a name because it was his mind, and he knew how it worked perfectly fine. He was able to achieve the same things neurotypical people could achieve, he just went about them differently. I finally felt as though I was a character in a book instead of simply observing what the character in a book was doing, and now I feel all happy and nice because of that.",books,2090

I'm currently reading *The man in the high Castle* and really enjoying it - fast pace, **lots of dialog** and interesting plot.

"This is something I noticed in my own reading habits. If I read book reviews which has any sort of negative written about the book, when I do eventually come to reading the book, I'll 100% agree with the reviewers and dislike the book. 

If I read negative book reviews *after* I've read the book, even if I thoroughly enjoyed it, I'll change my opinion. 

Every book has flaws and I feel like negative reviews for any book are almost always true. My enjoyment of the book hinges on how much I notice those flaws -- if before reading the book I read a review pointing out those flaws, I'll be hyperfocused on them during the reading experience. If I read a review *after* reading the book, I'll realize, oh yeah, that was there and that actually is annoying, how did I not notice it before.

So there's really no way for me to read less than 4 star reviews and still like the book, unless the reviewer blatantly dislikes something I actually really like (like a certain trope)",books,976
"Imagine what you felt watching 'Inception' or 'Prestige' for the first time. Specifically looking at the signs that have been laid out over the entire film.

So much so, that you want to see it a second, third and fourth time. Just to get every hidden sign.

Honorable book mentions would be 'Time and Time again' and some of the subplots of 'A song of ice and fire'. 

I'm pretty sure there have to be a few well known books and some hidden away gems, that only you know of. Share the names, I want to read them!",books,646
"I want to say first that the writing in question isn‚Äôt for my personal enjoyment. It‚Äôs simply an assignment for school that has a short deadline. I don‚Äôt have any fun reading these books because they‚Äôre boring, but I don‚Äôt really have much of a choice. When it comes to books I actually *want* to read, I‚Äôll intentionally go at a slower pace because I want to savor and take in the author‚Äôs work. 

I always had immense trouble reading books or any form of literature for that matter because of how long it would take me to finish them. Sometimes I would have to stay up until daybreak just to finish a short story I had to read for school because it would take me so long. I came to the realization that this snail‚Äôs pace style of reading wasn‚Äôt just detrimental to my enjoyment, but also my mental health because of how much it frustrated me.

I first realized this when I looked up how long it should usually take to read 30 pages of a book. The answer was about 50 minutes. My average for that many pages was 2 hours. This had to change, so I started looking up articles on how to increase my average reading speed. 

I noticed that the one thing all articles had in common was eliminating subvocalization. I can‚Äôt seem to do this completely yet. When I see a word, I subconsciously verbalize it in my head. Not long enough to halt my skimming, but it‚Äôs still a speed bump nonetheless. Is it possible to prevent yourself from subvocalizing entirely? 

It seems that what I‚Äôm supposed to aim for is viewing rather than actual reading. Using a wider view to take in multiple words and sentences rather than focusing on every single individual word. This has resulted in me skipping over a lot of different words, some of them important to understanding the context of the book. Do I need to slow it down?

I‚Äôve tried to use my pointer finger as a guide in order to read a line at an acceptable pace, but whenever I do this my eyes will get stuck on words within said line. I need to keep up with the finger. How do I stop this from happening? 

My last problem is that I‚Äôm having trouble using music to drown out my vocalization. I started using loud music with vocals in an attempt to occupy my brain, but whenever I did that it would shift my attention away from the words on the page to the words in the song. Whenever that happens I‚Äôm not really reading the book anymore. Is there any music I can listen to that makes this process easier? 

I *am* making improvements on it, if only by a little. My max reading speed considering a total of 30 pages has decreased from 2 hours to about 1 hour and 10 minutes. I still have no idea how people can read 30 pages within 50 minutes, but I‚Äôll get there eventually.",books,2713
"Hello, I decided I wanted to add reading to my hobbies but I encountered a problem and it frustrates me.

In the book, they explained about the ministries and what each of them do but after reading about it I didn't exactly remember it.

While the book has been good so far I don‚Äôt want to end up disappointed if I don‚Äôt come to find what I‚Äôm looking for.

"So as many of you know, the goodreads platform is owned and operated by Amazon. Since I started using it a year or so ago, I made some realisations I hope you agree with.

1. The UX is pretty bad, it‚Äôs hard to navigate and find items without clicking through miles of menus.

2. Reviews almost always seem to be in the 2-4 star range despite some books being outside of that scale. Reviews themselves don‚Äôt seem to be very well written with the example I encountered being posted in response to the title ‚ÄúHiggs‚Äù by Jim Baggot. Most reviews were negative with one even trying to deconstruct the laws of physics...

3. The app is a laggy experience to say the least and I have a nightmare trying to use it when trying to keep track of my reading.

The storys of all are great and the in between books help build the world more but my favorite is still the first, I crie at the end evrey time I read it (there is also a book written by a cowrie of the first that picks up after the first one but its name would be a spoiler, I can say that the book is named after one character that didn't get picked)

A story about an orphaned dwarf that got raised by a  human magician and then gets to go on an adventure with other dwarfs to safe their ""world""
(also to mention the legend of the √Ñlfar Dom sort of backstory and in between about some of the dwarfs enemy's) the first book was also made into a game

3. Alexey Pehov with chronicles of Siala and Chronicles of Hara  (first has 3 books and second has 4)
In the first we follow a thief who needs to fulfill a contract and in the second series we follow many characters whose paths will cross

"\- First off, I have been reading at a fairly quick pace recently, and this book absolutely killed that flow. Woof, this was not an easy book to read, and an even more difficult book to follow. I understood fast I was about to journey through a fever dream of drug use and gay sex (which is fine), but the abstract was such an obstacle to long reading sessions. The plot wasn't at all linear, the individual vignettes were often hard to follow. This one wasn't really as much a page turner as I had grown used to. So I wouldn't necessarily recommend this to casual readers.

\- While I freely admit the difficulty of this work, I would be remiss if I did not recognize that there is a ton of value in reading about the psychology of a drug user. Burroughs himself had to be steeped in the Heroin culture, and his bizarre characters kind of reflect this. The deranged and experimental Dr. Benway, always cutting through the core of different users... The slick William Lee... some of the recurring names display odd character traits that Burroughs must have been seeing in himself and other users. The consciousness of a junkie is something foreign to me, and extremely mysterious. Here we can catch a bit of a glimpse into the world these souls inhabit. And while gritty (holy shit, it is extremely dark and gritty), it is also almost supernaturally different. I could not imagine some of the places junk takes a person. 

\-I haven't delved into a ton of ""stream of conscious"" type texts. I guess I enjoy more traditional literature. Burroughs thoughts take the narrative all over the place and it can be easy to lose direction. However, the different environs he constructs were quite wonderful and fantastical. And there is something secretly addicitive in reading about such gnarly scenes. There is a certain culture I was able to tangibly feel in this book, much like I got a sense of a really interesting sci-fi/android culture reading 2001 and I, Robot. The obscene, drag, junkie culture is written in such a way by Burroughs, where at times it was almost alluring. Sometimes it even gave me a ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" type vibe. I always enjoy getting submerged into a new culture or scene. In this, I see why the work is considered iconic.

\- I guess the overall, message I took from Naked Lunch is, while junk and the Heroin culture can drive a person to frantic, lunatic lifestyles, it was also a commentary on the American Dream. The machine that is the Dream can send a wanderer into sick and haunting places once the hope has been crushed and lost. There is a certain expectation we have for a society that is free, and if an individual in that society cannot realize the American Dream, they are shunned and repulsive. I could be wrong, but I got real vibes of disgust for the western perspective. I would love  to hear what others thought from reading this book.

‚ÄúThe junk merchant doesn't sell his product to the consumer, he sells the consumer to his product. He does not improve and simplify his merchandise. He degrades and simplifies the client.‚Äù

"So I'm about 400 pages into Dostoyevsky's ""grand masterpiece"", and I have a problem: I just don't see where this all is going. It seems like all the book has been so far is philosophic musings about God and religion. While I do find this interesting to an extent, I guess I was expecting a plot to come with it. In Crime and Punishment (which I read and adored) there was an exciting incident that really set the story in motion, allowing me to appreciate the philosophy and what the author had to say about things later down the line. The Brothers K seems to be wanting to do things in the reverse order. 400 pages in and I'm starting to loose my patience, because this inciting incident hasn't happened yet. So what's the deal? Does something eventually happen in this book? Am I reading it incorrectly? I've heard that this is supposed to be one of the greatest books ever written, so it pains me that I'm not enjoying it at the moment. Did anyone who's read it have a similar experience?",books,991

"Lately, I (21M) have tried to challenge myself by reading ""harder"" books and I feel like my progress has been extremely slow. Previously, this was largely because many of the words were foreign to me and I hadn't read much since high-school. My vocabulary has improved greatly thanks largely in part to the Kindle quick lookup feature. 

But, recently I tried reading The Myth of Sisyphus by Albert Camus, knowing full well that it would be quite challenging. I couldn't get past the first page after trying for nearly 30 minutes. I tried googling the sentences that stumped me, and the best I could muster was a study guide that gave a general outline of the entire essay. I was wondering if there are online forums where I can post such tricky sentences and paragraphs and expect a breakdown by experts or someone who knows better.

"Before my sister ended up in foster care and then adopted by my mom she had a favorite chapter book she would read back to back. I was curious if any of you knew of a book matching her description. She lost everything when she went to foster care. I'd like to find her the book. 

She said it was about 3-4 girls who ended up in a mystical world. One girl could speak to animals and one could connect with nature. She said the cover was a typical fantasy book cover.

"""If Aureliano Segundo had something of his great grandfather and lacked something of Colonel Aureliano Buendia it was his absolute indifference to mockery,""

Shouldn't it be the other way around? It is a major plotpoint that Jose Arcadio Buendia killed a man over being mocked.

"So I just finished After We Collided, the second After book. These books are utter trash, romanticising a co-dependant, emotionally abusive relationship.

"I haven't finished this behemoth of a book yet but, I am nearing the end of part 2. Bolano's prose in incredible and the story in unbelievable enticing however, there are so many references to other great writers that are going right over my head. Part 2 mentions a ton of famous philosophers such as Heidegger, Hobbes, Nietzsche and more. This isn't to say that these references are lowering my enjoyment of the book but rather, making me wish I knew more about them to enhance my overall experience. I'll definitely be coming back for a re read at some point after brushing up on my philosophy.

"I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not the only one who happened to read the book and forget a lot of the details, like the name of the main character after a while. This is perfectly normal, but I would love to be able to remember a lot more of what I read. Therefore, I embarked on a journey to obtain a holy grail of memory.

The first option is quite logical, read the book again. This is the best option because repetitive actions reinforce memory. Case closed, right? Well, if you're like me and 99% of other people, you don't have time to do so because reading books is laborious and requires time, unlike movies where you can afford to spend one and a half hours of your time for rewatch.

My intuition told me there must be apps that could help me, and I was right. I stumbled upon a couple of apps that offer one-page summaries. While summaries are useful, I can google them myself and the information isn't tailored by my memories.

Eventually, I turned to Evernote. I made it a habit to make a quick summary of the chapter as soon as I read it, as well as other things like taking notes of random thoughts about a book and interesting quotes. I found this method to be the most effective although it's laborious.

As good as I think this method is, there is a slight problem. As soon as I finish the book, I forget about the notes. Yes, I can access them when I need them but it would be nice to get some sort of reminders.

Then it hit me that I could make a website where you can do everything I did on Evernote, but specifically for books, with an option to email your book snippets now and then (it could be customizable).

As much as I want to build this, I'm not sure if people would use it. I would love to hear opinions from guys that already take notes as I do, and from the rest of you that could potentially use this.",books,1818

"I just finished reading *The Adventures of Augie March* this morning, and I have very mixed feelings. At some moments it was very deep and moving, and occasionally hilarious btu it often felt like Bellow loved the sound of his own voice and had to halt the story every few pages to soliloquize (in frustratingly vague terms) about fate or freedom. The book just seemed fatty and top heady, especially in the last streatch after he comes back from Mexico. I'm usually fine with verbose prose, but this just seemed fatty and top-heavy.

"I will never claim to be the brightest bulb in the box, but I do love reading. As a weird kid who loved horror, I would get books from the library that were clearly too advanced for my age, but I would just skip over words/phrases I didn't understand, I was just thrilled to be reading a book that was for ""adults"".

Now that I am an adult myself, however, I find that I constantly look up words I don't understand before I allow myself to continue on in the book. It can be something as innocuous as a brand name mentioned that I'm not familiar with, or a term for a specific pattern of wallpaper when a location is described. 

I worry that if I don't understand every little nuance on the page, I'm losing a bit of the atmosphere the author is intending to create. 

But when does this begin to hamper the enjoyment process of simply reading a book? 

When I really think about why I love reading, I think it is that wonderful feeling you get when you have, without even realizing it, internally created sketches of the book's setting and fleshed out the characters in your mind - even if some of the more minute details are a bit foggy.

Maybe it's worth skipping over looking up that particular sofa brand from the 70's that a character briefly sits on, and just letting the book flow over you.",books,1299

"Written by H. Rider Haggard, author of King Solomon's Mines and SHE as well as several other books based on the Alan Quarterman character (played by Sean Connery in League of Extraordinary Men), Eric Brighteyes is an English romance novel disguised as an Icelandic Saga...or vice versa. 

Following the character Eric Brighteyes, the book gathers aspects of various Icelandic sagas into one cohesive novel. The classic English Romance books, which are not necessarily analogous to modern romance novels, are more like adventure stories centered around the love of a pair that is contentious or unrequited. Love under fire., the classic theme.

If you haven't read Haggard's works you are in for an adventure every time you crack open one of his books. From epic journeys to gripping descriptions of sword fights and everything in between, you are hooked early on and never bored. Haggard's writing style is straightforward and a joy to read. While utilizing aspects of ""old English"", he still keeps things flowing easily and poetically. When reading all of his books you are constantly seeing the book play out in the forefront of your mind. You can see the legendary sword, WhiteFire in all it's glory, forged by Dwarves and bearing ancient runes. The characters come alive and you either love them or hate them. 

I won't go into trying to summarize the book but the basic premise is this: Eric is a men among men, stronger, fairer and of true character. There is no guile in Eric. He is in love and this love is the conflict of the story. Omens, prophecy, ghosts, witches and treachery lie in every corner of Eric's life. 

Some regard this as Haggard's greatest book and I can see why. Having read Haggard's biography one can see that this man led several adventures of his own. His Alan Quartermain books contain many real life details drawn right from his own life.  Reading his books is educational and fun, inspiring and uplifting. 

This book as well, gives the reader a chance to FEEL like they are there during the long winters of Iceland. We can feel the weight of omens and prophecy weighing down the characters and while fate plays out we give into the inevitability of walking in the path that Odin has laid for us. 

The J. R. R. Tolkien Encyclopedia claims that Tolkien held Haggard's works in high regard. Some say he drew inspiration from this book in particular, and one can see some of the Lord of the Rings essence in this book. Characters sing epic songs, swords are filled with magic and the characters are indeed epic. 

An old book, a great book. One that you are happy to reserve a place for on your nicest bookshelf. 

If you ever were interested in the Icelandic sagas and you want to get a feel for the history and myth of the time you won't be disappointed.

"&gt;In 1956, Stevens, a long-serving butler at Darlington Hall, decides to take a motoring trip through the West Country.

As Stevens travels around the West Country he reflects on his life and the choices he made. He also discusses this within context of the choices his employer made in the lead up to the Second World War. 

On the surface it doesn't seem like Stevens would be a character I would relate to. I mean, it is not like I have a lot in common with a middle-aged English butler, who is driving around the West Country in the late 1950's. I guess it speaks to the skill of Ishiguro that he did get me to genuinely care about Stevens. It is hard to look back on your own life and judge the decisions you made to get that landed you where you are now. I felt like Stevens wasn't always honest with himself, but I also think that added to me liking him. It is hard to confront your own mistakes. It is far easier to justify them while looking back to excuse the fact that you made those mistakes. In that regard Ishiguro was very successful at making his main character relatable to me. 

On top of that the world around him is changing in ways that it would seem hard for a middle-aged butler to adapt to. I did feel that also played into why and how he is looking back at his own life. Perhaps the age of the ""great households"" is ending and his position in the world is no longer appreciated or even understood. 

What did you think of The Remains of the Day? Have you ever been surprised by how much you could relate to a character?",books,1546
"This will be a bit of a challenge. Any help or insight is greatly appreciated.

I'm looking for a fairy tale about a man who marries a witch. One night he follows her. The next day, he wakes up on a cliff somewhere. If I remember correctly, he then goes back home, possibly having to walk across a desert. I think there's a second event where she performs some witchy magic on him, before he, from memory, ends up killing her or possibly de-witch-ing her.

It was in a collection of fairy tales or stories about witches. And I read it over thirty years ago. At least one of the stories was Eastern European or possibly Russian in origin. 

Does anyone have any idea what it could be? Or any suggestions about where to look? Many thanks!

Apologies if I've posted in the wrong place.",books,782

"Several years ago when I was in middle school, I came across this very interesting read called ‚Äúphenomena‚Äù. It was about an inch thick and filled with stories told by different people from around the world. Each Individual story was about weird inexplicable things or situations that they had experienced that were unheard of or unique. One of the stories was about a man who was running his normal flight patterns and he flew through an abnormally thick, discolored cloud. When he came out through the other side, everything looked entirely different. Before he had a chance to process and fully understand what had happened, he flew through another cloud similar to the previous one and was right back where he had left off beforehand. Another interesting story in the book was about the struggles of the small percentage of people who spontaneously combust into flames. I don‚Äôt remember too much more because it was so long ago and I only got to read it once during a 30 minute lunch. I‚Äôve tried to find this specific book and haven‚Äôt had any luck.

"Complete Works by Plato

This legendary Greek philosopher garners the most recognition for his Socratic dialogues, modeled after the teaching and debate style of his mentor Socrates. These heavily influential talks outline Plato‚Äôs supertheories of supereverything, which means plenty of politics, science, mathematics, logic, epistemology, rhetoric, and other philosophical topics to go round.

Corpus Aristotelicum by Aristotle

Contemporary philosophy students have medieval scholars to thank for preserving another one of Socrates‚Äô devoted acolytes‚Äô major works, although speculation abounds over how much of it is authentic. Regardless, though, the Corpus Aristotelicum and its detailed examinations of politics, metaphysics, rhetoric, poetry, ethics, logic, science, and physics remains an essential read for all philosophy buffs, particularly those with a more ‚ÄúWestern‚Äù bent.

The Consolation of Philosophy by Boethius

Penned during the author‚Äôs year-long prison stint prior to his execution for treason, the partial inspiration for A Confederacy of Dunces asks the timeless question of why God allows bad things to happen to good people. Despite this heavy thesis, scholars do not believe Boethius meant for his musings as a religious diatribe (Jesus and dogmatic principles, for example, receive no mention), but rather an observation on the nature of existence using ‚ÄúGod‚Äù as a broad semantic stand-in for life‚Äôs inevitable ebbs and flows.

The Metaphysics of the Healing by Abu Ali ibn Sina

Also known as The Book of Healing, Abu Ali ibn Sina‚Äôs (usually Anglicized as ‚ÄúAvicenna‚Äù) masterpiece completely revolutionized many scientific and mathematical disciplines; although the title makes reference to the author‚Äôs entirely game-changing surgical and medical contributions, it has nothing to do with either topic. Rather, he ‚Äúnarrows‚Äù his attentions to building on earlier writings about logic, metaphysics, music, natural science, geometry, and astronomy from the Greeks and his fellow Muslims.

The Incoherence of the Incoherence by Abu I-Walid Muhammad bin Ahmad bin Rushd

Abu I-Walid Muhammad bin Ahmad bin Rushd challenged his Sufi contemporary Imam Al-Ghazali‚Äôs The Incoherence of the Philosophers, which lambasted the incorporation of Greek (specifically Aristotelian) thought into Islamic academia. Here, he utilizes a dialogue structured and responds to specific criticism, attempting to synthesize the two different belief systems into one harmonious whole.

Summa Theologica by Thomas Aquinas

Summa Theologica may be unfinished, but it still exists as one of the most important Catholic/Christian (and therefore ‚ÄúWestern‚Äù) treatises ever published. Although he writes about multiple theological subjects, Thomas Aquinas‚Äô main goal is actually quite simple ‚Äì explain what the Church believes (or at least believed at the time ‚Äì some things HAVE changed, after all) and why.

Secretum by Petrarch

Scholars often hail Petrarch as the grandfather of the humanist school, and Secretum ‚Äì which many believe may not have ever been intended for public consideration ‚Äì offers up pretty compelling evidence for this mindset. Reading like more of a self-assessment than anything else, he earnestly addresses Augustine of Hippo‚Äôs accusations that he does not take faith, God, the afterlife, and other core Catholic/Christian beliefs seriously enough.

Meditations on First Philosophy by Rene Descartes

Philosophy students eager to snap up as much metaphysical literature as possible should consider Rene Descartes an essential read, particularly his six meditations reflecting the shape of what he believes to be real and certain. Each one builds upon the other and structures itself as a six-day meditation ritual reflecting on whether or not God and the soul are actually things.

Leviathan by Thomas Hobbes

For the more politically-minded, Leviathan provides one of the earliest explorations of social contract theory, which attempts to make sense of humanity‚Äôs interactions with its governing bodies. Published as the English Civil War raged, the philosopher advocated for a solid, centralized social contract structure over which a supreme sovereign entity reigned.

Treatise on the Art of Philosophising Soberly and Accurately by Anton Wilhelm Amo

Most of this esteemed, though sadly often overlooked, Ghanaian philosopher and academic‚Äôs essays fueled one of his quintessential publications. As the title states, he pulls from his epistemological empiricism to deliver a discourse on ethical, honest intellectualism accessible to anyone hoping to participate.

Critique of Pure Reason by Immanuel Kant

Aristotelian philosophy‚Äôs traditional perspectives on judgment and analysis receive something of an academic smackdown in this ambitious assessment of a priori human thought. Most of Immanuel Kant‚Äôs oeuvre aimed to synthesize the concretely known with the speculative while still allowing room for some more abstracted speculations.

Fear and Trembling by Soren Kierkegaard

Many philosophy enthusiasts paint Danish theologian Soren Kierkegaard as the progenitor (if not first follower) of the existentialist movement, or at least the Christian wing. His semi-autobiographical inquiry into ethics, faith, and consciousness ‚Äì particularly as embodied in the story of Abraham and Isaac ‚Äì guided him through the trauma resulting from his fiance‚Äôs death.

On Liberty by John Stuart Mill

Classical liberalism ‚Äî the political philosophy which John Stuart Mill helped develop ‚Äî separated the state from the individual, adroitly summarized with the Harm Principle, which says the government holds no authority to interfere in anyone‚Äôs business unless they‚Äôre infringing upon someone else‚Äôs rights. Victorian society, as one can probably easily imagine, found such an ideology utterly radical and scandalous.

On the Origin of Species by Charles Darwin

Speaking of utterly radical and scandalous, On the Origin of Species continues to draw ire centuries later because the naturalist author dared to pioneer the entire field of evolutionary biology. While more scientific than philosophical, its impact on‚Ä¶well‚Ä¶pretty much everything since then (for better or for worse) earns the book a spot on every majors‚Äô and minors‚Äô shelves.

Thus Spake Zarathustra by Friedrich Nietzsche

Everyone‚Äôs favorite misanthropic existentialist parodies Judaism and Christianity with the adventures of the fictional prophet Zarathustra. While his famous, often entirely misinterpreted, theories regarding the Ubermensch appeared in earlier writings, here Friedrich Nietzsche further congeals the concept and discusses its (and society‚Äôs) relationship with God.

Being and Time by Martin Heidegger

At the intersection of existentialism, deconstruction, and hermeneutics sits the controversial Martin Heidegger and the incomplete (but still essential) Being and Time. It‚Äôs pretty dense stuff, focusing on the nature and meaning behind existence itself as well as slowly dismantling and examining metaphysical principles.

The Second Sex by Simone de Beauvoir

Building on Mary Wollstonecraft‚Äôs feminist foundation, Simone de Beauvoir injected a hearty dosage of communism, existentialism, and psychoanalysis into the frothy mix, which wouldn‚Äôt fully bubble until decades later. A philosophical and sociological landmark, this treatise on women‚Äôs rights cobbled together an intellectual argument calling for complete equality.

The Roads to Freedom trilogy by Jean-Paul Sartre

Inspired by watching Nazis rampage through his native France (as well as World War II in general), the existentialist and Marxist took to writing the novels The Age of Reason, The Reprieve, and Troubled Sleep as a way to further refine his philosophical leanings. Nobody should be surprised that the surrounding elements, sometimes autobiographical and semi-autobiographical, marked an evolution in his thoughts.

The Order of Things by Michel Foucault

Discourse and epistemology are the name of the game here, particularly when it comes to digging deeply into humanity‚Äôs relationship with the sciences throughout history. The social sciences in particular, although he also covers some of the life sciences, linguistics, art, and economics while eking out the truths and realities relevant eras conjured from them.

Of Grammatology by Jacques Derrida

Of Grammatology is a must for any and every postmodernist, deconstructionist, and poststructuralist out there, although most of its more immediately noticeable influence lay within the literary realm. Which makes perfect sense, seeing as how he deconstructs and re-examines the very notion of writing and its role in shaping human communication and thought throughout time.",books,8704
"I didn't understood almost 30% of the book, if I am being honest. But then again Stephen Hawking is talking about the secrets of the universe. So it's okay if some of it goes over your head. But I was able to clear up many of my questions about the universe and fill my mind with many more. I am grateful to him for that.

"This is a long shot - I‚Äôm looking for a book that was about 2 men‚Äôs quest to free animals from their jobs, one worked at a circus and the other a zoo. They took them up North America I think, and released as many as they could onto a sanctuary I‚Äôm pretty sure were near the Canadian border and some Reservations (excuse my lack of US geography). In the story they did lose some very old animals who were just too old and unfit for the travel. One was Sally the Hippo.
 

I read it in the early 80‚Äôs and I‚Äôd really love to read it again since I was so young then, there was probably a lot of content I didn‚Äôt understand. I‚Äôve always thought the title was Primal Fear or something similar with either of those words. The jacket of the book had tiger stripes all across.
What really stuck out to me was that at the end, they told how the story was actually true, and at the time of the book going to print, some of the animals were still alive! I think it must‚Äôve been in the seventies. I think the characters were a white man and a Native American who may have been shot in his efforts to release the animals.

"My Grandmother was a prolific reader. She was dutch, but always had a deep connection with English literature.

But for the life of me I cannot get through the first 30 pages just due to how dense this book feels, not to mention the tears. Can someone who has read the piece please breath new life into this book?

Covid 19. Had to stop workin. Summer break from college.

Anyway, I have lots of physical books but haven't read all of em. I also own a kindle which I bought for myself promising to read more. Then, out of all places, I saw a tiktok suggesting some books (book tiktok as we call it). Anyway, I now have over a hundred on my to read list. 

&amp;#x200B;

At the start of august, I said I'll read 4 books, a book per week. Well, it took me three and a half weeks to finish this one.

&amp;#x200B;

The book in question is ""The Time Traveler's Wife"" by  Audrey Niffenegger.

It was actually my sister's physical copy that lured me into it first. I was readin then it got to some rated pg parts so I moved to kindle. xD 

Anyway, it's an easy read. Always liked sci-fi and time travelling and whatnot so it pulled me in fast.

&amp;#x200B;

Even in the beginning, I got some bad juju on Gomez, and god did he prove me right again and again. :P 

Anyway, I kinda felt bad for when Henry said he'd go back to his mom's death again and again. 

Also, as others would prolly say here, grooming? It's a new concept to me. I didn't really mind it that much cus Henry was quite conservative and had boundaries no touchy. 

&amp;#x200B;

I like his work and how he'd run around the books naked. lol

&amp;#x200B;

I don't like Gomez's lack of self control. :P

I like Ms Kimy. Poor Mr. Richard tho.

&amp;#x200B;

Alba. Woah, she be an avenger at this point. has better control over her powers. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, not gonna take this too long. It's the first book I've read til the end in a long time. My goodreads has another book to it which I can label ""read"". :D 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I'm off to draw for r/sketchdaily and then maybe finish crocheting an amigurumi ball (I'm still a beginner :P) 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, if you're a guy and you're reading this and you're shy to talk about your newfound love for reading to your frens, don't be. I can be your fren. Breaking one gender stereotypes one by one right. ;)

From what I've researched, P&amp;V is more literal in its approach to presenting the story while Briggs tries to create a more distinct style. Is this accurate?

"Well, partially because I had never been into the world history until two years back and partially because my understanding of western Asia is kind of weak, I never came across Turkish history. 

I was fascinated by the title, however, and couldn't wait to start reading this after I read the summary. What a fantastic beginning to a book man, I cannot stop admiring how well the characters are sketched out. 

I do however find myself having to pause reading and keep getting lost in Wikipedia + google searches. Can someone give me more background/links where I can understand the Turkish history for the book?",books,612
"I really enjoyed the first part of the book, pre Pequod setting sail. Ishmael and Queequegs initial meeting and subsequent friendship is enjoyable reading. I just feel it starts to get bogged down with overly complex prose and, honestly, I think Melville rambles a lot, I felt my attention wandering as I read. I get that the use of language is of its time but it got too much for me. I've read older novels before, a lot of H.G. Wells and Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, admittedly I found the latter a slog too, but Melville has defeated me. The other reason for dropping it was simply that I wasn't having fun, I see a l lot of people saying you shouldn't force yourself to read stuff because you feel you have to.

I guess I'm asking what other people's thoughts are on reading older novels and if you have this issue too.",books,823

I understand that this is Murakami's style, but the ending left me feeling totally and utterly annoyed at the entire book. I don't want to say that it ruined the entire read for me, it didn't, but I do feel a bit cheated with how quickly and loosely he wrapped everything up. The ending felt like a rush job and really was not on par with the whole of the novel. Anyone else feel this way?",books,555

"  

Before I start typing, I want you to know that I have never written anything like this ever. This is the first time I‚Äôm attempting to share my thoughts on a book I read, publicly. Also, I have no qualifications what so ever to critic any book. I am just someone, like many others, who likes to read. Now, here is what I thought of the book. (Going to have spoilers) 

Humans are social animals and we tend to judge anyone and everyone who is not as social as we are. Seclusion from the normal people somehow gives a person, a family or even a group of people, a weird outlook. The Blackwood family had always lived in seclusion. Now I am not advocating for them. I am trying to convey how the people of the village always had a negative mindset for the family(, and vice versa) just for the fact that they liked seclusion. 

Now, about the Blackwood family. I think one of the main themes of this book was how childhood negligence destroys everything. From what we can see, the blackwood family never cared for the girls. Constance used to cook, more like she was expected to cook, every meal even before the poisoning. The children grew there, much like the vines on the burnt roof of the mansion, uncared for and unloved. And the poisoning was the ultimate revenge by Mary Catherine. 

Mary Catherine, through whose eyes we see everything, is a product of her tragedies. She is 18, as we discover in the beginning, but her way of thinking Is closer to that of a 12-year-old. The poisoning took place 6 years before the present day, meaning she was 12 when it happened. Secluded from the outer world because of her parents, and neglected by her strict parents, she develops a dream-world of herself. She believes that she has magical powers, that she can someday fly to the moon and live there, and she believes she can communicate with Jonas, her cat. She uses her imagination to escape the reality she lives in. She builds a reality where she has control over things, and this leads to a mixed reality in real life, which is less harsh for her. And this coping mechanism of her is reinforced by her accepting sister. Even on the day the poisoning took place, she cared for Constance, her sister. She knew her sister will be okay if she poisons the sugar, as Constance does not take sugar. Constance and Jonas are the only two souls who Mary Catherine cares about, the only two people in the world she thinks that love her. Rest of the world, her own family, the rude villagers, she wishes death up on them all.

Now about Constance, she knew immediately who was the culprit in the poisoning case. To protect her sister, she threw away the sugar and washed the bowl. Doing this, she protected Mary, but attracted all conviction upon herself. Now, even though she is innocent, the villagers think she is the murderess. She  could never go back to the village again. And she, was the sanest person remaining in the Blackwood family. But even Constance shows some abnormalities, indicating very much towards the stunted growth of her. She hides when someone wants to see her, and is in a constant dilemma in the second half about her responsibilities towards the family.

Coming back to Mary again, she read people better than Constance did. Even though she had some crazy exaggerations, most times her intuitions proved to be right. She thought that  Charles was a demon, and that his presence only brings change of the bad type. And this proved to be right after all. The villagers whom she always thought of with contempt, very much because of the family she grew up in, were not very different than her idea of them. They too, added to the misery when the house was burning. However, they did show some compassion after the event, by sending food to the sisters.

Overall, for me, it was a book about the effects of parental negligence, proud isolation from the outer world, and effects of baseless judgment. The Villagers did live up to the idea of the Blackwoods, but they also had better things to offer, which we discover later.

I don‚Äôt know much, but I loved the fact that Shirley Jackson decided to tell the story from the perspective of Mary, arguably the most complex character in the book. And‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs all I have to say.

Loved the book, and would recommend to people who like deep underlying themes, and mystery. This is just what i felt about the book. Do tell me if i got something wrong, or missed some themes.

Thanks for reading. Have a good day.",books,4469
"I've read quite a lot of romance books over the course of pandemic and I just want to gather my thoughts. I feel that its frustrating when the main character (usually female) can't see her self-worth and oh, she's SO ordinary and plain and can't compare to the females dream guy always hang around with etc. I mean, not to discriminate the many books that are like that, but it gets old sometime after, if the girl is super insecure abut she's actually beautiful on the outside. So I love books with badass heroines that own her self and doesn't fucking care about other opinions. Thats why I love Harlow from the Sainthood series, and Aelin from tog ( actually I don't love Aelin but refreshing to see a woman with the attitude of *needs no man)* Ofcourse, I've read a lot of books about that, and I think partly the reason it bugs me is that I've **seen so much of it**. And same with vice-versa. This is why I want to read more books with male leads, its more refreshing and different from being in a girl's thoughts, and that most of male pov books aren't as depressingly pitiful, even if some are nerdy book-lovers its just different !!!

Another thing is the beauty. I get tired when I see elaborate descriptions ( thick, copper bouncy curls, heart-shaped face, long thick lashes, high cheekbones...) for every character. Yes, appearance is important, but personality, character development and whether the person itself is interesting is vital! I don't feel too passionate about this, but like once you finish a series, you close the book, don't think about it and later when you're re-reading it or talking about it, you're like ""WhY is EveRy character so beautiful and basically perfect if you're an outsider?? "" As in if you don't know the characters and from outside perspective, their lives are perfect, they're either pretty or beautiful, or average but still pleasant to look at, they are uber powerful (either you're astonishingly powerful, or you very sadly have no power but **so much** smarts, you're cunning and soon rise to the top, or you're tough, skilled etc) Actually I feel that this is me pointing out true facts, instead of complaining, since the 'either you're powerful or smart thing' makes for a good book. Still... everyone be creative!

I hate it when guys are actually crushing really hard on the main female character and have sex with them but after continue to act like nothing happened, and continue to be with their girlfriends and put up a show in front of the girl lead, and sneer at them blah blah blah. Those are our asshole, manwhore-but- later-change-their-ways heartbreaker males. Which I would totally devour if they're in a book, since again, that's the point of the book, and these dark bully ones are sooo good, but those scenes make me root for the main girl even more ( if she's likeable, that is) and hate on the guy for some time until there's some sort of redemption arc or a swoony, just the FEELS romantic gesture that would never ever happen real life that just makes there readers melt. Thats how the cycle goes, but I still hate it. Which is also why I want strong, bold females beautiful inside out to show them and possibly flirt with others in front of him(s) and show them they can play the game as well and make him hot and jealous. sigh. I just got worked up typing this... can any of you relate to me? And what do you guys also hate about books, just triggers you?",books,3430
"I‚Äôve never been one to enjoy a mystery novel save for a few; e.g., The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, let alone been into YA in a long time. I guess it‚Äôs safe to say I‚Äôve grown out of the latter in recent years. As a now 19 year old, I can‚Äôt help but recognize the pervasive mawkishness in YA with heightened awareness. I no longer relate to it. That isn‚Äôt to say YA is bad. I just feel like a lot of the mass-market ones can‚Äôt be distinguishable from one another. They circle around the same surface level themes, the same dynamics, the same ambience as that of every Noah Centineo movie. Nonetheless, I think it‚Äôs safe to say this book re-ignited the enthusiasm and excitement of it all (in its own right, of course).

The Truth About Secrets deals with grief, separation, sexuality, abuse, and relationships. Quite evidently, it is a very timely story. It managed to intermingle all these themes without seeming like a thematic agenda was placed before the story. It felt seamless and not at all contrived. And that is one thing I very much applaud the book for: its maturity, its integrity, its sensible approach to reality. 

I find that the book was extremely well-written. The prose is enough to draw you in. Nothing was too overdrawn. Each character was depicted sensibly. There were no embellishments, no idealist trope exploitation typical of YA. 

There are probably certain things I failed to take notice of on account of the fact that my enjoyment completely overshadowed them all. It‚Äôs not the best book I‚Äôve ever read but it‚Äôs certainly one that I‚Äôve enjoyed ‚Äì for its originality and beautiful and sensible depiction.

"I've seen criticisms about the ending in Anna Karenina, they didn't like Anna's suicide. but Tolstoy did a very realistic and well-grounded ending.

One of the book's inspirations: 

 On January 4, 1872, at 7 pm, an unknown, well-dressed young woman, arriving at the Yasenki Moscow-Kursk railway in Krapivensky County, climbed onto the tracks at the time of the passing of freight train number 77, blessed if and threw itself on the tracks under the train, and was cut in half. Tolstoy and his wife Sofia knew a ""young stranger"" in the news. It was Anna Stepanovna Pirogova, the thirty-five-year-old lover and governess of one of Tolstoy's closest neighbors, Aleksandr Nikolaevich Bibikov, a forty-nine-year-old landowner and widower. Bibikov came to prefer the family's German nanny, whom he wanted to marry. When Anna Stepanovna was informed, she ran on her way in pain and despair with some clothes on, and sped around the next three days to her own with sadness. Then she threw herself in front of a freight train at Yasenki station.",books,1037
"The little prince was an unearthly child who lived on an asteroid a little bigger than himself. He was accompanied by a little rose, which he loved very much. But the little prince's vanity hurt his feelings towards her. The little prince bid farewell to the asteroid and began to travel into space. He had visited six planets in turn, and he was saddened by what he saw and felt that the grown-ups were ridiculous and unnatural. It was only on one of the planets where the lamplighters lived that the little prince found someone to be his friend. But the world of the lamplighter was so narrow that he could not contain a second man but himself. Under the guidance of the geographer, the lonely little prince came to the earth where human beings live.

The little prince found that man had no imagination, only to repeat, like a parrot, what others have said. The little prince now missed the little rose on his own planet more and more. Later, the little prince met a little fox, the little prince with patience to conquer the fox, and it became a close friend. The fox presented the little prince with the gift of a secret from his heart -- that he could not see with the naked eye the nature of things, but only with his heart could he see them all. With this secret, the little prince and the pilot in distress in the Sahara desert to find the spring of life. Finally, the little prince left Earth with the help of the snake and returned to his asteroid B612.

The fairy tale describes that the little prince is not conquered by the deceitful world of adults, and finally finds his ideal. This ideal is the love which unites the universe, and which the world lacks. As a result, the little prince often showed a feeling of sadness. This book is dedicated to the former child who became an adult, author Saint Exupery said in the dedication.

The Little Prince is not only popular among children readers, but also among adults. The concise language of the novel permeates the author's profound thoughts on human beings and human civilization. Its irony and fantasy, truth and philosophy make it the most famous fairy tale novel in France and even in the world.",books,2164

### My guesses

* **Overture** means that you‚Äôre a musician.  Its literary analogue is an opening statement of the main body of text that is not immediately part of the main story.  It could be an unrelated chapter for mood-setting or a one-chapter prequel before the rest of the story occurs.
* The **introduction** can be words from either the author, publisher, or editor.  It‚Äôs the place for meta-textual notes on the rest of the work.
* A **preface** is something that I associate as being written by the author more so than publisher or editor but could be written by all three.  I think of it as less meta than the introduction.
* When a preface or introduction by the author already exists and the editor wants to add their meta-text, it is time for a **foreword**.

"I've been in a book slump lately, and browsed A LOT of books on my kindle but really, I'm super not in the mood for contemporary romance or bully, enemies-to-lovers romance. Other days I would try, but I'm now looking for romance books that is fantasy and has paranormal elements. Humour is a bonus, but actually I'm perfectly fine without it. Either the main character finds out she's paranormal or she was one growing up. (these are the 2 main tropes but open to other types)

There are the kind of books that are very fast-paced. I don't mind, but I'd rather the lovers not just get into the sex right away. I'm not describing this very well, but there are the kind of books that the male(s) sees the female and oh, its irresistible( especially if there's a mate thing going on) and they just crash and have sex. No problem with hook-ups, but (if you understand) you know what I'm talking about: With no character building or start of plot whatsoever, the characters don't even know each other( this is not my problem) but it bugs me when the characters have sex first sight, they have best sex ever, and after that the male just sticks to her, alpha etc, a series of problems are thrown their way and 'their love gets tested' *those kinds*. I want development, world-building and loads of other stuff along with romance, not just throwing in everything!!! But if there are those kinds of books but after the sex they connect with each other more, and after events doesn't only revolve around their love, then its fine. slow- burn I care for, but super- slow burn like a snail is just so damn frustrating. Also if the main characters keep on resisting, at first you understand but it gets old after some time, like even when all their restraints are gone. And I want some steamy hot scenes, even its in the end... Shortish, action-packed but overall delicious and solid plot or longer, well-written ones are good.

So I've written more than I expected, oops but whatever.  ps. reverse harems are ok

"I read half of the first book in a series of I think three in high school. I don't remember what it was called but I'd love to start it again. I think it was about a boy and a girl who didn't know each other and somehow traveled to another world. In this world they met this old blind guy who said he was the king, but his kingdom was ruined and he asked for their help. I don't remember much about the story, but I remember at one point the main characters had to run across a lake of a boiling hot liquid, but if they ran fast enough the surface of the lake wouldn't break and they would stay above. I also remember a character who was part of a species that can be revived if a seed in the back of their necks is planted after they die. Is this enough information for anyone to identify the book, or does anyone have any ideas of what the series is called?

"I've been wondering this for a while. When I read a good book, I get sucked in like it's a movie and forget that I am there in the real world. Instead, I am just a passive witness to what happens in the story. Is it the same for others? Do you also forget you're there, or do you picture yourself as one of the characters, or something else entirely? I sometimes hear people say they've ""met"" a character or ""been to"" a fantasy place that only exists in books. Those phrases always strike me as odd and make me wonder if they are picturing themselves as part of the story. What happens to your sense of self when you read?",books,622
"I recently read and really enjoyed this novel - after learning the 70's-disaster-movie classic about survivors attempting to flee a capsized ocean liner is based upon it.

I was surprised to find in reading modern reviews, that many consider the book to be bigoted - which I don't really understand. 

Whenever bigotry, racism, or homophobia is brought up in the novel, it is purely through the voice and dialogue of two specific characters (a policeman, Rogo, and his wife, Linda) - who happen to embody these undesirable personality traits. These two characters are also actively disliked by the rest of the characters.

I read it and it felt very like a very generic late 19th century novel. Maybe you folks could help me?

I know it contains references to the bible, but I‚Äôm having a hard time finding symbolism and other literary devices in the book.

So first my opinion on the book: it‚Äôs held back by its language in my opinion. While attempting to build up its scenery it frequently dwells for too long and loses my attention. That might be just me. This book invented one of modern media‚Äôs favorite cliches, and the premise is great. It also has this great characteristic of being open to interpretation while not having to rely on a cliffhanger, an increasingly rare feat these days. Some people say it‚Äôs a commentary on British imperialism, some say it takes a stance on religion, among other things. The ending is clever, and really sound. I hear people frequently say it‚Äôs rather gimmicky, but I wouldn‚Äôt have wanted some epic battle like in independence day. That would ruin the somber atmosphere the book tries to build up. Imagine a spectacular ending in a book about a bland protagonist and his wife and an army with awful technology fighting an awful battle against creatures with lasers that can melt humans?

One does not simply begin reading *Moby Dick* without preparation in much the same way a whaling ship cannot leave the harbor without its necessary crew and equipment. Just as infamous Captain Ahab required, so too must you have plenty of provisions (foresights) like maps, a captain‚Äôs log, a compass, and food for thought before you step on board the *Pequod* and go awhaling for the White Whale. This introduction provides some of these considerations without unduly giving away its most enjoyable aspects.

To appreciate Moby Dick, one must understand the scope of Melville‚Äôs vision. His work is a wanderlust odyssey that ventures beyond and before the realm of the Gods to the abode of the Titan.  *Moby Dick* is a titanic work of art that wretches all notions safeguarded by man for their supposed virtue and reverses their meaning,[\[1\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/submit#_ftn1) proving that while the truth will set you free, madness may grant terrible purpose.[\[2\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/submit#_ftn2) For this reason, others have considered Melville and his book a ‚Äòtragedy‚Äô, a contention that only proves the shallowness of their own understanding, for: 

‚ÄúThere is a wisdom that is woe, but there is a woe that is madness. And there is a Catskill eagle in some souls that can alike dive down into the blackest gorges, and soar out of them again and become invisible in the sunny spaces. And even if he for ever flies within the gorge, that gorge is in the mountains; so that even in his lowest swoop the mountain eagle is still higher than other birds upon the plain, even though they soar.‚Äù

Setting Ahab‚Äôs purpose as high as ‚Äòthe unsetting pole star‚Äô, there can be no illusions to the gravity of the characters this book contains. As above, so below for in reverse reflection to Ahab is the Whale himself, the Leviathan of the deep who moves among the watery foundations of the Earth. Just who is this mysterious Leviathan? 

As your introducer, I would lead you to consider him no less important than an allegory for the *Leviathan* described by Thomas Hobbes. In the opening sentence of his seminal work, *Leviathan,* he writes, ‚ÄúBy art is created that great Leviathan, called a commonwealth or State (in Latin, Civitas) which is but an artificial man.‚Äù In other words, the Leviathan is the collective of man. Repeatedly throughout the book, Melville mocks the governance of collectivism with rich satire and dark comedy while simultaneously attempting to kill the Leviathan that is Moby Dick. Among history, there are no more famous Leviathans than the ones written about by Hobbes and Melville, which is absolutely why it is impossible to find the true meaning of the book without becoming a philosopher. 

The extremely philosophical nature of the book is likely why it flopped so hard on initial release and, despite acclaim as one of the best books of the world, remains unpopular, even amongst avid readers. In a tongue and cheek take on the matter, the author writes 

‚ÄúVery often do the captains of such ships take those absent-minded young philosophers to task, upbraiding them with not feeling sufficient ‚Äúinterest‚Äù in the voyage; half-hinting that they are so hopelessly lost to all honorable ambition, as that in their secret soul they would rather not see whales than otherwise.‚Äù 

Nevertheless, the fact that the ‚Äòthunder-head‚Äô whales are referenced to being philosophers themselves, such as Kant or Locke, suggests that the study of the subject is indispensable to the story. The irony is, nowhere in Moby Dick, except buried briefly in the book‚Äôs extracts does one find the previous reference to Hobbes‚Äô *Leviathan*. A hint of the importance of the Leviathan is etymologically supplied as well, however, since Cetus, Latin for Whale, it almost identical to Civitas, the Latin for the State given by Hobbes. 

Dozens of aspects about Moby Dick portend its fight against the white whale is symbolic of Man‚Äôs quest to reckon with the artificial man Hobbes describes in the *Leviathan*. The starkest of these is the tradition of individualism that the, unequivocally American[\[3\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/submit#_ftn3), epic encapsulates. Here, individualism is best understood not in the cultural sense, which is collective, but in the personal sense that is psychological, as the term itself requires. 

For a proper definition, one needs to refer Carl Jung‚Äôs work on the process and importance of individuation. According to Jung, consciousness in Man is acquired through the identification and reconciliation of opposites inherent to the archetypes of the unconscious. Through their integration, man becomes an ‚Äòindividual‚Äô and therefore wholly indivisible and unique, just like the story of *Moby Dick.* 

In Chapter 107, The Carpenter, Melville‚Äôs preference for the individual is brutally stated: 

‚Äútake high abstracted man alone; and he seems a wonder, a grandeur, and a woe. But from the same point, take mankind in mass, and for the most part, they seem a mob of unnecessary duplicates, both contemporary and hereditary.‚Äù

What makes Captain Ahab anything but contemporary and hereditary is his quest to seek out and kill the white whale. 

Ahab resists contemporization because his revenge is eternal.. Whalemen declare ‚ÄúMoby Dick is not only ubiquitous, but immortal (for immortality is but ubiquity in time)‚Äù. Hence, Moby Dick may exist pr√≥teroi theo√≠,, that is from the Titan‚Äôs era before the gods. This coupled with the fact that these earlier giant gods were supposedly cast into the ‚Äòunderworld‚Äôs eternal darkness‚Äô (ocean) suggests the ‚Äòhooded phantom ‚Äô is some kind of a Titan. 

There is also no way that Ahab can be hereditary because he has chosen to take revenge instead of accepting any consolations given to him by the universe. This act leads him to not only surpass the other men but the gods themselves. Through his quest to kill the Leviathan, Ahab becomes a tyrant-titan himself whom Melville compares to Prometheus.[\[4\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/submit#_ftn4) 

Interestingly, after giving Man the gift of fire stolen from heaven, Prometheus was chained by Zeus to a rock where an eagle ate his liver each day, only to be grown back that night. Why would the King of God‚Äôs enact such torture? To send a message that is necessary to prevent man from gaining the self-reliance necessary to threaten their rule and seize Godhood for themselves, for this precisely what the Gods did to the Titans in the first place. It is the same reason, no doubt, that Zeus split the wholeness of man in the first place, ‚Äúcondemning them to spend their lives in search of their other halves,‚Äù according to Plato. 

This begs the question, is Moby Dick Ahab‚Äôs missing half and, if so, what sort of god-defying effort is required for their apocalyptic reckoning? You‚Äôll just have to read to find out.

"Around Nov/Dec last year my students (13-15 yr Olds) recommended me this book when we were talking about books in general (I teach English}. Now, they were super excited about it, bursting out of their seams and their hearts were sad because of how tragic the end is.

Fast forward to staying at home. I had lots of time and decided to read the book and often times I couldn't shake off the uncomfortable feel I got from it. It seemed wrong. This wasn't a book 15 yr Olds should be reading and fantasizing about.

It crearly romanticizes a huge age gap (especially visible in the famous film adaption that was made for CMBYN) and how Oliver, the recent grad who has been spending his summer in Elio's house, knows this is wrong but continues to indulge in it. I mean, tell a 17 year who is smitten with the 24 year old you that their relationship is wrong. Would he ever back up? He'd fight for this first love! This feeling!

There is certainly grooming taking place. This isn't even about pedophilia. It's about kids who read this book, get inspired from it and probably are led to think that it is normal to have relationships with adults that seem like friends. I know I'm just ranting hhere but I see my Instagram feed and sometimes this movie is constantly posted (because book is famous) and it is thought of as this huge, romantic novel full of tragedy of losing love (which wasn't love by the way. Oliver leaves, never looks back, gets married, comes back and tells Oliver and leaves again.) I think of my own students. They're so young and impressionable, their age is so delicate right now and this is what they're getting influenced from. Sigh.",books,1656

I was born in 93 and I would have had it as a child if that helps put a cap on age of it.

I've heard so much about Agatha Christie, considering she is the most prolific thriller/mystery author of all time. But i haven't gotten around to her books until now. It was worth reading And then there were none. Not only was I blown away by the
skilful writing and intricate, clever plot but it gave me hope that I could read a book published so long ago and feel wholly invested in the story. It definitely blows all these thrillers coming out today out of the water. 

For those who haven't read it, heres the synopsis from Goodreads:
 First, there were ten‚Äîa curious assortment of strangers summoned as weekend guests to a little private island off the coast of Devon. Their host, an eccentric millionaire unknown to all of them, is nowhere to be found. All that the guests have in common is a wicked past they're unwilling to reveal‚Äîand a secret that will seal their fate. For each has been marked for murder. A famous nursery rhyme is framed and hung in every room of the mansion:

""Ten little boys went out to dine; One choked his little self and then there were nine. Nine little boys sat up very late; One overslept himself and then there were eight. Eight little boys traveling in Devon; One said he'd stay there then there were seven. Seven little boys chopping up sticks; One chopped himself in half and then there were six. Six little boys playing with a hive; A bumblebee stung one and then there were five. Five little boys going in for law; One got in Chancery and then there were four. Four little boys going out to sea; A red herring swallowed one and then there were three. Three little boys walking in the zoo; A big bear hugged one and then there were two. Two little boys sitting in the sun; One got frizzled up and then there was one. One little boy left all alone; He went out and hanged himself and then there were none.""

When they realize that murders are occurring as described in the rhyme, terror mounts. One by one they fall prey. Before the weekend is out, there will be none. Who has choreographed this dastardly scheme? And who will be left to tell the tale? Only the dead are above suspicion.




I'll repeat this again: I loved it. I loved following this nursery rhyme and linking it to the story. I loved the constant guessing. I loved the twists. I loved everything. 

Speaking of the twists, did any of you see the twist at  the end coming? I sure didn't. I had other theories in mindüòÖ.",books,2576

"I couldn't see much discussion on this, so I thought I might inspire some.

It is the sad story of Billy Casper, over the course of a day (with flashbacks) in an unnamed Northern English mining town. Kes is the name of a Kestrel Hawk he found and trained, his one outlet and source of happiness. Jud, his older brother, is something of a tyrant to him.

I found it interesting to compare the ¬£10 bet with Kes, in terms of their importance to Jud and Billy. Billy finds importance in the kinship he has with Kes, a kind of pure immaterial thing; Jud simply wants to have more money and ease in his life, perhaps disabused of the notion that there is much of this happiness to be found.

In the end he is crushed, and a reality of sorts descends upon him. He will leave school, enter a dead end job, and become like Jud. One hopes he might fight against it, this episode strengthening his resolve, but for now it appears as if hope as died.

In the context of 60s Britain, there could be a sense that hope has died, in these left behind towns and dark satanic mills. This is just what I got from reading it, I could be completely wrong.",books,1134

I have tried looking online, I have tried calling used book stores in my area, and I have tried calling the major book chains. I cannot find these books in hardcover for a reasonable price.

The two books I need are:
*Vengeance of the Iron Dwarf
*Archmage 

I'm really just hoping someone has them and is willing to sell them to me at a good price or know of a place that may have them. I am at a loss and I need them.

Thanks in advance for any advice or opinions.",books,882
"In 2014, I was living in Africa and I picked up a book that I‚Äôm pretty sure was written by a Scandinavian author. I can‚Äôt even remember the plot of the book, but it was a comedy. It had something to do with American big game hunters from Florida. There was also some prostitutes that one of the hunters mentions go to school to learn how to perform oral sex. I think one of the hunters dies from being sat on by and elephant/rhino/hippo? The whole thing is loosely making fun of Americans, but in such a way that was still funny to me (an American). It reads like a Jonas Jonasson book. 

Any help would be Greatly appreciated! It‚Äôs like having a song stuck in your head but it‚Äôs a book. And it‚Äôs been stuck in my head for years.",books,729
"I like to read (when I actually do read....) but sometimes I get intimidated by starting a new book (or show). I think it's the commitment to something long and unknown that makes me reluctant. This often results in me delaying the adoption of a new book or getting demoralized if life gets in the way of me finishing it. I know reading shouldn't feel that way, but it does make me feel bad when I have something I haven't finished/started simply because it feels like a *task*.   


Anyway, I picked up [Masterpieces: The Best Science Fiction of the 20th Century](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40281.Masterpieces) on a whim at Goodwill a few years ago and realized that I'm actually a big fan of short stories. I get all the fun of reading a compelling story without the baggage of having a bunch of half-finished books. Then, when that story is done, I can start a new one. And if for some reason that story sucked, I don't feel bad about it because of how small the commitment was. I'm currently reading Ray Bradbury's [The Illustrated Man](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24830.The_Illustrated_Man?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=1U6pkRo3JQ&amp;rank=1) and it's been an awesome ride.  


I obviously have an affinity for science fiction, but I wanted to know if anyone else feels similarly. I love me a good novel, but I feel like I could read short stories forever.",books,1382
"The Mahabharata has so many stories within stories within stories, and such a wide array of rich characters and plot-lines, and it has been described as ""the longest poem ever written"". 

The overall plot is available on Wikipedia, but the basic story is one of familial conflict.

&gt;The core story of the work is that of a dynastic struggle for the throne of Hastinapura, the kingdom ruled by the Kuru clan. The two collateral branches of the family that participate in the struggle are the Kauravas and the Pandavas. Both Duryodhana and Yudhishthira claim to be first in line to inherit the throne.   
&gt;  
&gt;The struggle culminates in the great battle of Kurukshetra, in which the Pandavas are ultimately victorious. The battle produces complex conflicts of kinship and friendship, instances of family loyalty and duty taking precedence over what is right, as well as the converse.

There are a lot of parallels between the plot and characters in Martin's ASOIAF series, and The Mahabharata. From an overarching perspective, the most glaring similarity is the focus of who will be ruling the empire, and this forms the basis of the central conflict in both narratives.",books,1177
"(This is mostly aimed towards non-British/American/Australian people, etc.)

I'm Dutch and I usually never read Dutch literature. For some reason, I don't enjoy the style and the subjects that are dealt with. For example, I've found that a lot of Dutch novels are oversexualized, in my opinion. Also, a lot of our country's more modern literature is about (or takes place during/around) the Second World War, which I prefer not to read about and am not very interested in. Maybe it's just because I've been reading the wrong books, but this has been my personal experience.

Instead, I read mostly English/American literature, as well as a bunch of other countries from time to time (Spain, Italy, France, Brazil, Japan, Russia, to name a few). I feel like every country has a certain ""style"" or ""vibe"" to their literature, if that makes sense. (Although I don't mean to generalize, I probably haven't read enough to judge.) I don't know if anyone else feels like that too.

More specifically, I'm talking about books with full stories and complete narratives. They are basically novels with their fair share of drawings in-between chapters or in the middle of important scenes. The drawings can also serve to visually describe complex places or objects within the story.

Let's say 1/5th of a 400 pages book is made up of drawings.

"I just recently finished this book lent to me by a friend who had been saying I read it for ages. From the first chapter I was hooked. I can say without a doubt this is Freedman's best work(in my humble opinion) maybe even the best thriller I've ever read. The main protagonist is so absolutely perfect but broken and so damn real. The writing style is perfect and while the suspense was much less as compared to his other books there was still plenty of it. Plus the lawyer work was absolutely amazing and as far as I can there were no plot holes which is kind of unusual but very impressive. Also when I got to the end I had no regrets.

"As far as I know, it was convention for Victorian fiction to present first person narratives as if it were a fictional document or as a spoken tale within one. Most of Wuthering Heights is a tale within a tale, and  Frankenstein (which isn't Victorian era but whatever) starts off as letters then is a spoken tale which then has its own spoken tale within it. It seems to be a bit of a clumsy way to changing perspectives if you don't wish to have an omniscient third person narrator, at least from my modern point of view. Even novels that are mainly straight forward first person narratives seem to have sprinkled in self-conscious references to you the reader, as if you were reading a memoir (I'm thinking about Jane Eyre). I'm wondering if an ""unmotivated"" first person novel was a thing back then. Would it have been strange to just have a your character's voice speaking out only to herself, or into the void? Would Wilkie Collins get away with telling his multiple perspective stories without writing in an epistolary format, or would readers be confused? I'm wondering if these things are only an invention of modernist fiction. Anyone who is more well read in the era's fiction, could you tell me if there are British Victorian novels that are more modern in that regard? The most innovative I can think of is Bleak House, which switches from third person and first person.          

I'm imagining the alternate universe in which Faulkner has to write The Sound and the Fury or As I Lay Dying as a series of letters and diary entries to ""motivate"" the different perspectives. What a thought.",books,1602

"[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/i7pf9b/before_starting_wolf_hall_i_surfed_through_rbooks/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) is the link to the review i wrote after finishing *Wolf Hall*. In the end, I wrote that I would be starting the second book soon, but was unsure whether to take it up rightaway or take a break with some light reading.

*Wolf Hall* was a gargantuan wave of information, and only Mantel's lucid narrative prose kept me abreast with Thomas Cromwell and the associated characters. I believe *Bring Up the Bodies* lives up to the same expectations.

The second book catches up almost where we left off in the first; the journey of king's court to Wolf Hall among other provinces, where he meets Jane Seymour. 

Differences I felt between the two books (other than the obvious ones):
Whereas Wolf Hall brings in a glimpse of Cromwell's childhood, it also it uses most of its prose to build England and its characters are that time, so I felt the first part of Cromwell trilogy was spanned over a huge expanse. 
On the other hand, BUtB was set about the span of just more than a year (1535-36)‚Äî from the first meeting of Henry and Jane, to death of Katherine of Aragon, to Anne Boleyn's execution (which kept me on my toes).
It is interesting, that where in case of WH, it took me a month to digest the verse, BUtB was over within 15 days (which I think also corresponds to the speed of timeline in the book).

Overall, it was as satisfactory as Wolf Hall, if not more; a dig into one of the most studied, discussed, researched periods of English history. I'm looking forward to The Mirror and The Light eagerly.

"#  [The Mind and Art book By Bahador Qashqai](https://bahadorqashqai.com/books)

 

## Since beginning of human‚Äôs thinking about art, there have been discussions ideas and theories about soul, mind, color and works of art.In this writing, these issues won‚Äôt be considered because any artist is familiar with them. This writing is for those who see art created by soul and mind and those familiar with art and those who love it and see art separate from materialistic issues and as an spiritual value.Usually there is a white page next to each painting to think and concentrate more and get people‚Äôs more attention to the painting.

## [‚Äú BAHADOR QASHQAI ‚Äù](https://bahadorqashqai.com)

 

## In any kind of art, there is a special feeling and soul, that comes out of mind.Human in this world, is connected to a soul apart from body organs that present art works. This soul, is the same feeling that is used to create a piece of art out of someone‚Äôs mind. On the other hand all that is used to create a piece of art has influence on human‚Äôs soul and mind.

"On an average week I go through about 2-3 books. I read mostly fantasy, sci-fi and web comics but occasionally I‚Äôll come across a book, or a comic or even a show that completely immersed me. One where I‚Äôm not on the outside microanalysing ever flaw, trope, or trick. The more I read, the harder it is for me to find a book like that. But those books keep me reading at 3am on a weekday and make me forget reality until only that world and those characters exist. So what do you do when it‚Äôs over?

My first instinct is to try and find something just as good. Anything that keeps from returning to reality again. But that‚Äôs almost impossible, because the next book will always live in the shadow of it‚Äôs predecessor. 

Sometimes I go looking for a shitty book, but that just cheapens the immersive experience, taints it somehow. 

Sometimes I stop reading for a while. Until I‚Äôm done savoring that experience, but that leaves me with an unfulfilled craving in my belly. My brain keeps trying to get back in the book, but there‚Äôs nothing left to consume.

"I just finished reading Mama Black Widow for the first time and I haven‚Äôt seen it really discussed anywhere so I decided to write my thoughts and feelings about this book.

Iceberg slim is a master at capturing the ghetto and exposing it to his readers. I read Pimp: The Story of my Life recently too, and it‚Äôs blown me away the narratives this man was able to create. I never imagined that there was a former Pimp who could tell such heart wrenching stories, and who could so masterfully show the rawness but also the reality of ghetto life. 

As far as mama black widow specifically goes some of the main themes that really stuck with me was the tearing down of Otis‚Äôs father once he got to the north. We have a man who was a proud preacher in the south, and while his family may not of had many luxuries when they lived in the south their father atleast had his pride. This all changes when they move north, and I think this is something that not many people consider about this time period for Blacks. During the time period known as the ‚ÄúGreat Migration‚Äù black left the south by the thousands, but it doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean the norther ghettos where better. This is something that Iceberg has explored now in both Pimp and Mama Black Widow.

Another really interesting part of this to me personally is the in which Otis is exposed to his homosexuality. He is raped by a religious figure who lives in his Apartment building. This book came out in 1969 and here we have a book dealing with the abuse of young people by trusted clergy. This is decades before the Catholic Church scandal, but here we have an example of this abuse.

Finally I‚Äôd like to discuss mama herself. Another thing this book shares in commons with Pimp is icebergs ability to make you hate the protagonist mother. This book however doesn‚Äôt show any redeemable side of the mother though in my opinion. It‚Äôs obvious in Pimp that his hatred began with his mother, however I think this book does a much better job of showing how a mother can destroy her own family. Otis‚Äôs mother successfully destroys her entire family, and I‚Äôll spare some of the major spoilers but the pain she cause her own children and husband is heartbreaking. This book truly has an appropriate title. 

Mama black Widow was a great read and I plan on reading all of Icebergs books. I wish more of iceberg slims work was discussed more heavily because I honestly feel as though some of the content in his books could be studied in college courses.",books,2493

"I've just finished reading the Red Queen and it was terrible. It seemed like the general storyline of a lot of popular YA books. I've also read a couple of other YA books in the past week and they all failed to grab my attention. It's the same plot over and over again. The characters lack depth. The plots are unoriginal and predictable. It's the same insta-love stories. Some have even started to get very explicit. There's a specific genre for if you want to make your stories that explicit. I don't think it's in the category of YA anymore. Let's not forget the trend of trilogies. I feel like a lot more authors are making their book s into trilogies or 4-5 books series for no reason. They have filler books where nothing happens. 

Look, I love reading and I thought I would be reading a lot this summer. It's been almost two years since I've read any books because of school and I was excited to get some reading done. However, I'm thinking of giving up on reading for now. It feels like I'm just wasting time reading these awful books.

"Wow. Just... wow (Only kidding, r/bookscirclejerk ). But really, what an incredible piece of work, and I do use that phrase to capture it's nastiness. I wrote a little stream-of-consciousness review and wondered if anyone would like to disagree with or expand upon anything.

'Cormac McCarthy's epic Western is a rolling nightmare, a long gaze into the abyss of man's brutality and insignificance. We follow The Kid, a fourteen year old runaway, through his time with the Glanton Gang, a ruthless band of scalpers hired by the Mexican government to hunt native Indians. It is hard to tell how much of the narrative is filtered through The Kid's perspective, but assuming it all is perhaps helps make sense of the writing style. McCarthy uses archaic language and allusions to literary classics (from the Bible to Milton's Paradise Lost to Faulkner) to make everything feel larger-than-life, archetypal, thereby allowing the story to act as a portrait of man. A portrait that resembles Dorian Gray's, or even Goya's Cronos. The descriptions of violence are gratuitous, detailed, blunt, not at all dissimilar to the descriptions of the surrounding fauna and wildlife, suggesting violence to be as ingrained in the universe as nature itself. Such is the worldview of the story's antagonist, if indeed there is one, Judge Holden. Supernaturally skilled and devil-tongued, The Judge towers of all other characters in height, intellect and ability. His name lends him the appropriate authority an establishes him as the personification of violence, if one assumes his view 'War is God'. The Judge waxes poetic about conflict as the ultimate morality. His description as infant-like, hairless and often naked, yet also eternal, possessing inhuman knowledge and claiming to know God himself, establishes him as an instinct innate to humanity, perhaps to life itself. The instinct to conflict. To impose one's will upon another; the subtle references to his serial rapes are a reinforcement of this, a Shakespearean play on the word 'will'.

The surrounding characters have little to no internality. Glanton comes close to being a rounded character, the broken, nihilistic leader of an army of ghosts. That he is so easily seduced by The Judge perhaps comments upon the internalization of a 'Might makes Right' philosophy that becomes those making their living out of combat, the numerous references to his commune with animals a comment on his relationship with his men. Glanton, and all military leaders - official, mercenary, criminal - prey on man's animal instinct to combat, reducing them in the process. Toadvine is perhaps hard-pressed to be called a character, his description superficial, but perhaps this illustrates the point above. The Ex-priest is the closest The Kid gets to a father figure, and the reader to a figure of morality, yet even he is hardly fleshed out, and not moral so much as neutral, having abandoned the priesthood yet still opposing The Judge. The Kid tries to stay neutral throughout the book, never taking place in the more extreme violence unless forced to, and even trying to help some of his comrades. Perhaps his neutrality, or belief in it, is why The Judge ultimately turns on him and the Ex-priest. They've been party to every murder, rape, torture and betrayal committed by Glanton's gang, and so are hardly innocent; they still must be judged. Perhaps the book's message is that there is no fence-sitting when it comes to morality; that despite the fact that The Kid is scarcely mentioned for most of the novel's second act, he is still there.

What propels the reader through the vagueness and monotony of much of the book's middle (this isn't a criticism, as it's purpose is clear) is the language. McCarthy limits his punctuation, omitting even quotes for speech (a choice that also serves to undermine the sense that characters are characters and instead suggests they are part of the story itself, embedded into the natural order like it or not). His sentences run on and on, becoming almost list-like accounts of action save for the epic, dreamlike feel provided by the expansive and archaic vocabulary. The effect is that the story reads like the ramblings of a dead-inside madman, frenzied yet matter-of-fact in his telling, having witnessed everything from a place of objectivity. Like a half-crazed God powerless but to despair over his creation.'",books,4393
"I don't know exactly when this started, but I've got this.... problem. Every time I start a book, I get really engrossed in it (or so I think), I get about halfway through, reading several pages a day (sometimes several chapters, but at least 15 pages daily), and then life happens the only way life knows how, and I get sidetracked, and put the book down. A few days pass and the urge to finish the book is gnawing at me. I pick it up, and I read a couple pages, then I put it down. Then a few more days pass by, and it just sits on my nightstand with my journal, and my Hangul notebook... just sitting there. Collecting dust. 

&amp;#x200B;

The most recent loss in this war of attrition with my attention span is Stephen King's \*\*\*""The Outsider""\*\*\*. I found the plot to be amazing. The set up was great, the book is a really fun ride through about page... 225. I know the page count because that's where I opened it up... about 3 weeks after I put it down (I dog-ear my pages so I don't lose my place). Before joining the Army, I used to read \*\*\*CONSTANTLY\*\*\*. I would read at least a book or two a month.

&amp;#x200B;

The Outsider isn't the first book that this has happened with. It's happened with Island 731 (took me about a month and a half to finish), Project Nemesis (same), James A.A. Corey's ""Leviathan Wakes"" (2 months), I just can't seem to keep up and get either sidetracked, or put the book down for something else. 

&amp;#x200B;

Are there any suggestions that you guys have for getting more... involved, or more stern about continuing through a book? Any goals that you guys set for yourselves when you read, or anything that you can think of to help out with this? I don't really know why I'm stopping. I genuinely enjoy the books that I read, but then, for whatever reason, I just stop reading them.",books,1834
"Both for books with no adaptation and books with a movie. 
I recently finished the Eragon series after putting it off for so long, and decided to check out the movie. It was... an experience. No wonder there hasn‚Äôt been any movie sequels. And...spoilers for the movies coming up...but it‚Äôs like they didn‚Äôt even talk to the author. Or read the book. I can‚Äôt even imagine how Christopher Paolini felt on opening night. It is honestly impressive how they managed to write a plot that made the second book impossible without major retconning.

"- What sources do you use to find recommendations?

- Do you have general rules you follow when looking for a book?

For me, it depends on what I'm reading.

- Non-Fiction - Recommendations usually come from GoodReads non-fiction lists or tags, but I've found a couple good ones from podcast recommendations. I usually listen to (rather than read) non-fiction so I focus on audio books and I generally look for books that are rated really highly on GoodReads.

- Fiction - Recommendations mostly from GoodReads lists, but I've found a couple from author recommendations on Instagram. I also have this horrible habit of avoiding fiction books that are less than 300 pages. I feel like anything shorter often lacks enough substance - just not enough space for plot and character development and I'm left unsatisfied at the end. (Is that wrong?)

Anyhoo. Looking forward to what strategies and sources you all use to find your next read. :)",books,937
"I have found recently that when it comes to choosing something to read, I'm mostly drawn to books I've read before.

I just seem to lack the energy or will to read anything new, like I just feel like I can't dedicate time to reading it (yet I can for something I've already read?) or they just don't seem very interesting. I don't want it to feel like I'm forcing myself to read new books, as I may enjoy them less than I would normally.

"I understand now why it won the Nebula Award.

But! Unlike all the other books that won that award and I have never heard of, people never commented on and the books which never really influenced major works like GRR Martins, Game Of Thrones. This ones an amazing read. 

Throughout the book you have them talk about feints within feints within feints. Our boy Frank reminds you of this as he creates those feints throughout the book( a bit like ""Hey I can make good apple pie"" and gives you free samples throughout the journey - maybe the analogy is different). Anyway I thought there would be more feinting at the end with the fight between Paul and na-Baron, but it was still good. 

The story at the beginning was humorous example: Tufir and the Fremen first time talking in the desert after the invasion. 

The interactions between the Baron and his cronies. 

After that I found there wasnt much play, except a few one liners.

I liked the flow of the story otherwise and felt there was a lot going on during the discussions, as mentioned above. You look for the feints within the feints, so you pay close attention. 

Anyway going to read the appendix then move on to the other Books (Book 2.....3....4...5).",books,1215
"1. the plotting in this story is a combination of slow, methodical pacing with quick bursts of energy that shocked me on the first read
2. the characters are really fleshed out in their own unique way as the story progresses, we start to learn more about how all of them ended in a wasteland dystopian version of England
3.  this book is dealing with very abstract concepts like simulations, multiple lives, nanotechnology, sexuality, what it means to be a human in a nonhuman world
4. the last thing is that the ending might be one of the more surprising ones if you have read the story as it left itself as a cliffhanger which could turn this book into a series 
5. this is the type of story that should be adapted to the big screen and the people that I would like to see take a shot at it should be Christopher Nolan, Denis villuanue, Ridley Scott and lastly Matt Reeves as I would be fine with any of these people end up making this movie",books,943
"I just want to get it straight that I absolutely love reading, but for a very long time I have always had this chip on my shoulder about it being the ""correct"" and ""best"" pass-time for ""clever people"". This has probably been said many times on this sub but that narrative is just so toxic. I guess I'm making a big deal out of this because I've recently made this revelation myself and I find it really exciting.

Thing is, in the past I have always loved the idea of reading, and there have been a small handful of experiences where I've truly and legitimately enjoyed a book and absolutely devoured it. Though, being the competitive person that I am, I was always really intimidated by people I knew who would read about 2-3 books a week, almost feeling guilty that I am not able to do the same because I felt like I did not have the attention span to be able to do so. Also, as a kid I knew a lot of teachers/family members who put reading on a pedestal in a way that made me feel bad about enjoying things like video games etc. which I think was kind of wrong, and is a shame that it still happens to some degree, because all it did was push reading away from the list of things I liked doing.

Having to deal with constantly looking at the page number, gauging how much I've read in a day and whether I should be feeling good/bad about my progress... That's just no fun, and it made reading feel like work, because that's how I saw it for a very very long time.

Recently though, I realized that reading, just like a lot of other pass-times, is not work, nor is it meant to be; it's no different from bingeing a great tv series or watching a few movies back to back -- we all just want a good story at the end of the day, right? There are great books and crappy books, just like there are great movies and crappy movies. 

Just because you're not reading Dostoevsky doesn't mean you are not a cultured person, nor does it mean you shouldn't be having fun. Reading *is* fun and you just have to read what *you* want to read and stick to the genres/topics that *you* enjoy reading and are in the mood for. Don't compromise on the kinds books you go for, you know what you want, and there is definitely going to be a book out there that can scratch that itch for you! Speed is irrelevant too, and I can tell you from recent experience that it comes a lot from your natural enjoyment of the story than it being a ""trained skill"" or anything like that. 

Anyway that's my rant. While I am probably preaching to the choir by posting on this sub, I just wanted to express how excited I am to finally be able to jump into the endless world of books without the burdens that I once carried with it! 

TL;DR: Just discovered reading is hella fun, and all I had to do was go for the books I actually enjoy reading",books,2807
"So, I just finished reading the second book in a series that will never continue. The Tales of Guinevere is the series name and the books that were published were The Dragon Queen and The Raven Warrior.

I knew that the author, Alice Borchardt, had passed before I started the second book, and so I had a lot of feelings while I was reading that went nearly from the book, but were from its unfinished state. About life, and the meaning of death and unfinished business, unfinished stories. 

I just wanted to commiserate in the existentialism of it all in relation to books that end without a conclusion, or series left incomplete. I feel like there is a sadness, but also a kind of poetic beauty in it.",books,704
"I‚Äôve recently broken up with my girlfriend of 9 years and I‚Äôve been really digging into reading.

"Hey folks,

I'll preface this post by saying I'm not much of a reader. I'll go through maybe 2 to 3 books a year. However, I recently broke my ankle, so the down time has left me with plenty of opportunity to read!

A few years ago, I went to a garage sale and bought Watchers by Dean Koontz on a whim. I loved it. Couldn't put it down. Craving more, I then read his books Breathless and By the Light of the Moon. For some reason these just didn't click with me. I didn't enjoy them nearly as much as I enjoyed Watchers, and that turned me away from reading more Koontz books.

Two weeks ago I decided to give his book Whispers a try. I just finished it today and I loved it, largely for all the same reasons I loved Watchers; it was exciting, suspenseful, had decent characters, and was (mostly) rooted in reality. No ghosts, no superpowers, just crazy people and events that I could at least sort of believe.

So, good people of Reddit, could you recommend me some Dean Koontz novels that I might enjoy? Watchers and Whispers are from the 80s, whereas the two I didn't like are from the 2000s. Does that mean I should avoid his newer stuff? And are there other mystery/thriller writers I should look into?",books,1207

I recently read somewhere that you don't realise how many people you dislike until you have to come up with a name for a baby. 

I'd say the same goes for book characters. When I associate a character name with someone I dislike in real life, I find it more difficult (but not impossible) to warm up to that character. I find it moreso with books as opposed to movies, as you have to create an image in your head of what this character looks like.

"I want to want to read, but I just can't anymore. I used to love it, but school gave me ubreasonably high reading goals. If you've never heard of the Accelerated Reader program then I envy you. Its goal is to encourage reading, but what it actually does is make those who enjoy reading read so much they hate it. If you have a high reading level, you are assigned by the school a higher point goal. Most books are worth 2 to 8 points, though the average is around 4 points. You have 9 weeks to complete the goal. I was once given a goal of 36 points. So, I scavenged the library for books I thought I'd enjoy, and found quite a few. After several books I ran out of things to read that sounded good, but I still had about 10 points left to go. So I was forced to read whatever I could find, good or not. Most of the books I hadn't read yet were either 1 point each at most or incredibly long books like Gone With the Wind or War and Peace. I couldn't gave finished any of those in the time I had left, so I had to read many boring and unenjoyable short books. Finally, I had reached the goal. I thought that maybe since I had taken the tests for so many low reading level books the next goal would be more reasonable. This was not the case. The next 9 week period, I was given a goal of 40 whole points. Keep in mind that at around this time I'm in 8th grade with a college reading level, but no desire to read college reading level books. I could have probably finished a longer one if not for the fact that I wasn't allowed to read in class, not even when my work was done.

Dead Zone is one of his best works and by far. Everything seemed real and all the characters were relatable. It was nice to see antagonist who wasn't Randall Flagg or some evil entity. I know it is one of his first novels that he wrote but may be the best because it doesn't rely too heavily on fantasy elements. Some of his works rely too much on good vs evil troupes.  It is just real enough to be believable and has enough story and plot to drive the story. If you need a fun quick read this one is a great pick. I was wondering what your thoughts are on this book.

"I have just started reading in the last few months, probably one hour per day at least, up to four hours a day on the weekends.

I seem to read about one book per week or so depending on how long the book is. 52 weeks in a year will cost me about $520 to $1040 if I keep the hobby up.

Will purchasing a Kindle help? As far as I can tell most Kindle books are $8-10, so this would reduce the price to $416 to $520. I guess I'm kind of opposed to an e-reader, although I have never tried it before. I might do it if I can find enough friends to vouch for the experience.

How about Amazon Unlimited? I've asked a couple of friends who say that there are not enough books available on Amazon Unlimited.

Without knowing anything about libraries, I would assume that it would not be a fun experience: using a poor search engine for a book, having to walk down to the library to pick up the books, having to rent used books that have been read by hundreds of people, etc. But perhaps I shouldn't be complaining about paying for books on Amazon if I am uncomfortable with going to a library.

"Alcohol. Drugs. Death. Alienation. Suicide. All talked about in the most ordinary of ways. As Bill Buford coined the term 'Dirty realism' well that describes Raymond Carver with astonishing accuracy.

Real people, real problems. No American dream, no wild fantasies just real life. Some real gems within this short story collection.

The story of Dummy the deaf man was real sad but touched on alienation/ bullying. A passage from the story:

* I looked at Dad. His face was funny the way it was set.  ""Women"" he said. He said, ""thats what the wrong kind of woman can do to you Jack."" But I dont think Dad really believed it. I think he just didnt know who to blame or what to say. It seemed to me everything took a bad turn for my father after that. Just like Dummy, he wasn't the same man anymore.*

Have you read the book or any other Carver? Opinions on dirty realism? Definitely less popular than magical realism I'd say.",books,926
"Hi so this questions been bothering me for quite a while now. I‚Äôve heard some people say that it is better to read a lot even if it‚Äôs not at an insanely high level of focus. And then I‚Äôve heard some people say that it doesn‚Äôt matter how much you necessarily read, but how much you deeply focused you are and how much you can absorb in one go. What do you guys think?

Any answers will be helpful. Thanks üôè",books,405
"I read the novel No Longer Human by Osamu Dazai in one sitting, there was no way I was able to put the book down. It was so beautiful and dark at the same time, I read into his life story as well and makes me think that this was in a way his suicide note. However it also states that he was in the middle of writing ""goodbye"" when he passed, made me feel very empty reading that. I loved how this novel made me feel very, familiar, with what Yozo felt and thought. The way he wrote this made me feel so connected with him, I cant lie and say I didn't shed a few tears at the last statements on page 169-170.  That being said, can anyone recommend me more novels like this?",books,672

"So I‚Äôve started school and reading is pretty important. Sure I‚Äôll read something small every now and then, but when school comes, it‚Äôs been such a hassle to read.
I don‚Äôt even decide to open up my book and actually go page by page as the teacher says, usually I‚Äôll either read the first and last sentence of a page or I‚Äôll read all the dialogue in the page.

"I'm sure others feel this way too, but I just wanted to express my disappointment in sci-fi/fantasy books that have unique and incredible worlds but fail to establish a strong voice that fully enriches the readers. 

To be fair, when I read summaries of sci-fi/fantasy books with creative worlds I develop expectations for how those books are written. But still, when the author can come up with a really cool world I just want the book to be SO GOOD in order to give the creation justice. Harry Potter and Game of Thrones have had exciting fantasy worlds but also great writing to satisfy the reader. I guess I just wish we had some more of these types of reads.

"I'm making a habit of discussing the books I've read on here with you guys, it's always fun.

I just finished *A Portrait of The Artist as a Young Man* by James Joyce, and enjoyed it quite a bit! I think as a 20 y/o who is alienated from their own nationality and trying to figure out my shit for the rest of life this read was really quite comforting to read. Watching Stephen mature and decide for himself to subvert the church or any kind of national obligation (like learning Irish) was a breath of fresh air.

This is the first Joyce novel I've read, and his narrative style was something I haven't quite encountered yet. This interesting blend of stream-of-consciousness and real conversations. Also, following characters as they move through an environment, enountering new characters along the way to join in on conversations which would then morph into memories or internal monologues were quite tricky to navigate  but it was really smoothly executed.

The opening chapters where Stephen is still a boy were soaked with a kind of awe for the world around him, and Joyce's ability to capture that sense of wonder, by zooming in on small details of the physical world made the environment really vivid and beautiful, it reminded me of myself as a child always asking questions to my parents, and silently watching people interacting in my mom's office and so on... 

The section in the middle where Stephen's growing personality collides with the external world of religion was maybe the most challenging for me to get through; this endless sermon of hell was really quite excruciating haha. I think it was difficult for me to relate to this but still the passion with which the dialogue is written is really great, and once it swapped back to Stephen's perspective on the matters at hand I found it really brilliant.

I think by far my favourite section was the final third of the book, in which Stephen is having long conversations on his philosophies of aesthetics and what he now firmly believes; it was kind of cathartic in the sense that he had become the man he is, rather than sumbissing to the church and becoming a priest... 

This book was interesting, it isn't standard in its use of characters or plot or narration, I think I'm still trying to make sense of some of it. His dialogue with one of his friends at the end of chosing an isolated existence of devotion to art, and beauty was also curious, in a sense it seems akin to a priestly devotion, but to his own religion, something I hope to find one day.",books,2528
"So, I've never had a beef with audio books. But, I always thought that a physical book was always the best option. Subsequently, I rarely read e-books or listened to audio books.

The issue was that after I graduated and ""got in the real world"" my time was filled with other things and I devoted less time to reading. I probably averaged 1-3 books a year from 2016-2019. In 2020 I decided that there were too many books on my ""to-read"" list and I needed to work on that. So, I downloaded Libby and started borrowing audio books from my library.

So far this year I've Read/Listened to 19 books. It's incredible. 

Now there are some downsides. If i'm listening and get distracted I might miss whats equivalent to a couple pages... But I also zone out during regular reading, so it's kind of the same thing. Also, I can't Highlight/bookmark/refer back to previous sections of the book. This makes some non-fiction books very hard to follow if I miss something (Listening to Behave was a nightmare lol).

I think I still prefer going to a coffee shot, getting a cup of coffee, and reading for a couple hours on a rainy day. But life doesn't allow that. And now I can listen when walking my dog, preparing dinner, commute to work, going on runs, playing ""mind-off"" video games, etc.

Has anyone else experienced something similar? or what are you opinions on Audiobooks?",books,1367
"Highly recommend this book! It started a bit slow for me because there are a lot of characters introduced, but this ended up being a 5 star rating for me. This is a novel, but heavily based on the author's family and their experiences. The book is about a Jewish family (parents and five adult children + partners) in Radom, Poland, opening in 1939. They are scattered in their attempts to survive the war, and the book follows their various perspectives of what happens to each of them. 

Some things I especially liked about this book:

* Not tragedy porn: this is something I've been increasingly cognizant of, and WWII books are a prime genre where this is an issue. As I noted, the events in the book actually happened to the author's family so right off the bat that mitigates some concerns. I also found the writing to strike the right balance for describing traumatic events and the characters' struggles. I definitely felt emotional at times reading but it didn't feel emotionally manipulative ever to me. 

* Shows experiences that are not covered as frequently in this genre: there are so many concentration camp stories in this genre, and while those are very important and something a lot of people experienced, it wasn't the only experience of Jews and other victims. (Not spoilers because shown early or in blurbs) This book highlights some of those other experiences as well - living in Jewish ghettos, living under Soviet vs. German occupation, living in exile, imprisonment in a Siberian gulag, etc.

* The author's note at the end is really touching and discusses how she came to write about her family's experiences.",books,1636
"So I recently started reading eBooks. I've mostly been using the kindle app but  I just got an offer from Google play books so I started browsing.

"**Spoilers for Strange the Dreamer ahead**

I've never been a huge fan of romance. I very rarely read a book purely based on romance, and mostly just tolerate it as a side plot or better yet, just how the relationship between characters develop. But I can't understand *why* a perfectly decent plot or story is completely derailed by the author's need to shoehorn in some predictable, awfully scripted romance.

I've just finished Laini Taylor's Strange the Dreamer. When I bought it I didn't actually realise it was YA, I just liked the premise of the story. To be fair for about 80% of the book I was really into it. It had some misgivings here and there but on the whole I was enjoying the characters and the way the 'mystery' of the city of Weep was unfolding, not to mention Lazlo was quite a sympathetic character.

And then enter the (inevitable, I suppose) romance between him and Sarai. I actually found the initial &gt;!dream scenes with the two of them (i.e. the scene where they were having tea in a river and before that in the library) !&lt;quite sweet and I wasn't batting an eyelid at the flowery prose. But then they just dove deep into such a nonscensical romance where they'd barely known each other for all of 48 hours hours. It completely shafted the focus of the novel &gt;!from the mystery of the mesarthium to Saving Sarai, !&lt;which was incredibly boring to read. Not to mention, &gt;!an entire chapter to discuss how they were kissing. !&lt;I feel the relationship between &gt;!Sarai and Eril-Fane could have been explored more as well as the rivalry between Lazlo and Thyon Nero (who was actually becoming one of my favourites). !&lt;So many rich relationships were right there to be delved into and it's sad that they weren't.

I think I'm just feeling robbed of what could have been a great fantasy read to get lost in, and it ended up being a typical Hollywood romance. &gt;!(Not to mention Lazlo's revelation was just... so rushed despite being seen a mile away)!&lt;. 

I also don't understand what the point was with the Feral-Ruby-Sparrow situation. Those relationships gave nothing to the plot, nothing to character development except &gt;!showing how horny they were when their world was on the brink of destruction. I don't understand why Taylor decided to write Feral and Ruby having sex when it had no bearing on anything. !&lt;

Ultimately I'm just annoyed that this is one of those books for me that could have been great but missed the mark by something stupid. Despite my initial dislike for romance, I actually want to read a well written one now. One that's interwoven into an equally fascinating and enchanting fantasy. I can handle purple prose, but only if it's embellishing an already great plot. 

This idea of 'romance' is obviously not isolated to this book alone. I completely get that YA is a market and it's all done to bring in money. I guess I just feel a bit jaded that what could have been a good story was ruined by something that only required some imagination to fix, of which this author undoubtedly has plenty.

Can't imagine I'm the only one who thinks this?",books,3124

"I was never much of a reader, the last book being something like goosebumps - probably one of those 'choose you're own adventure' ones aswell. Everytime I picked up a book I found myself having to read the same page about 3 to 4 times as I just kept getting distracted. Throughout school, I skimmed through the chapters of the compulsory reading books and half-arsed the essays that had to be written about them. 

Until I woke up last week with a craving to read something that wasn't displayed on a digital screen. 11/22/63 was recommended to me and from turning to the first page I was unable to put it down. I finished the book today and can easily say that this novel took me on an adventure that I never thought possible. It was such an immersive experience and I am emotionally exhausted, in a good way. It bought joy, laughter, fear, tears. It was frustrating and satisfying at the same time. I was almost tempted to start it again straight away after finishing, but instead I've picked up a copy of Pet Semetary which I'm about to dive in to.

"I apologize if this is a question that is asked too frequently, but I have been a frequent recent visitor of /r/stopdrinking and am into my third week of sobriety. One of the most helpful things during this time has been finding books and listening to them on Audible. I am not a fan of the 12-step program, so I am going at it alone with only the help of reddit, Audible, and podcasts, and it is actually working pretty well so far. There are a ton of books out there that deal with getting sober, and here are the five I have listened to so far, and liked very much:

1. ""This Naked Mind"" by Annie Grace
2. ""Alcohol Lied to Me"" by Craig Beck
3. ""The Unexpected Joy of Being Sober"" by Catherine Gray
4. ""The Easy Way to Control Alcohol"" by Allen Carr
5. ""Alcohol Explained"" by William Porter

Next on my list to listen to is ""We are the Luckiest: The Surprising Magic of a Sober Life"" by Laura McKowen, which is based solely on a Goodreads recommendation.

I was hoping that some of you might know of other excellent books that fall into the non-spiritual, non-AA category; or, moreover, books in general that deal with addiction psychology (I suffer from depression and have been addicted to other drugs in the past as well), motivation, fitness, and general well-being, but not with a spiritual slant. I like the books I listed above because they are written logically and have scientific backing and do not bring God into the equation.

Listening to books and podcasts has saved me during this lonely pandemic. I have decided to use this time to better myself and get sober, rather than do what I was doing early in the pandemic (March-July), which involved even heavier drinking on top of 15 years of heavy drinking.

I'm an English teacher, so I typically read fiction novels, but for the first time in my life I am discovering the power of these personal memoirs of addiction and recovery, and I find them extremely helpful. If there are other memoirs, science books, or even historical non-fiction that have helped you grow as a person, feel free to recommend them. I have so much time to listen that I am knocking back 2-3 books per week, and again this is saving me and opening up a whole new world of health and happiness.

"I‚Äôm a 14 year old, and i used to spend so much time, every night, reading a good book. I used to love RPG books, rick riordan, sci fi, space fantasy novels, and many others. Sometimes i even read a book the night i got it. But now, i dont know if its from quarantine or just the internet in general, i feel as if there‚Äôs nothing happening in the books, and I‚Äôd rather play video games. I really want to read to learn and enrich my brain, but it just feels boring sitting there when there‚Äôs other things i could be doing. Did i just grow out of reading?

"I really loved the characters and setting of the Witcher. I liked the different narratives between Geralt and Ciri, and also liked the short story books. Season of Storms was an enjoyable read too. One thing I didn‚Äôt like was when they‚Äôd flash forward to the future and have random characters talk about the events of the past. Not only did it spoil some of what happened, but I felt it ruined the immersion of the story for me somewhat. 

Does anyone have any suggestions for other books like this? I was thinking of Game of Thrones but I‚Äôm not sure if I want to start reading it if it‚Äôs possible Winds of Winter could just never release. Anyone have suggestions of perhaps some lesser known series that have a similar feel to the Witcher? Thanks for any suggestions!",books,768
"I'm used to miring myself solely within Agatha Christi, Doyle, and some Orczy... but damn if this author doesn't nail ""easy reading""; ""whodunnit""; and ""light"" reading!

Take it from me, if you know what you're walking into, this huge series is always fun and easy - and there's always a murder!",books,378
"I, like many people, had never heard of the Witcher story prior to the Netflix adaptation of the story. I, like many people, were completely entranced by the show and felt the need for more Witcher. So, I decided to dive into the book series, and was I sure happy with the journey those books took me on.



First off, I love fantasy stories. Kings, queens, witches, wizards, monsters, knights, bandits, folklore, good, evil, all of it. So this book was already geared towards a genre I enjoyed, but it wasn‚Äôt a guarantee that I would enjoy the story. 



The story was rich in complex characters that evolved as time went on, and though you get to know the characters well, they still surprise you countless times. The evolution of Geralt, Ciri, and Yennifer could be seen, felt, questioned and also understood at the same time, and created a story you longed to know more of. The other more minor characters throughout the book are unique, exquisite, and contribute so much to the story as well, and a connection is felt between the other characters, as well as the reader. When someone dies, you mourn. When someone triumphs, you cheer. When one deceives, you grind your teeth and turn the pages longing to get to the point where they get what‚Äôs coming to them.



The story is told in a way that seems to only tell you what you need to know, only when it‚Äôs important to know it. The lore and history is woven throughout the story to help explain the current events, while also creating a vast world with a complex story that makes you feel like you understand the world they live in. At the same time, it creates questions that you didn‚Äôt know you had, and makes the desire to turn pages grow. The battles are epic, and there is a particular battle at the climax of the last book that is quite literally a roller coaster ride (trying to avoid spoilers here, but holy crap, you hold your breath the entire time). The love scenes are anywhere from lustful and animalistic, to passionate and engrossing (with a little bit of rape and violence). The story also does not lack for twists and turns, and you give up on trying to guess what‚Äôs going to happen next or believing that you have the book figured out quickly, because you don‚Äôt.



Finally, the books ends well. It‚Äôs sad, it‚Äôs beautiful, it‚Äôs violent, it‚Äôs poetic, and it seemed the right way to end a story with so much love, violence, heartbreak, hope, deception, and individual growth. For anyone who likes fantasy novels, I highly recommend the series.




‚ÄúPeople""‚ÄîGeralt turned his head‚Äî""like to invent monsters and monstrosities. Then they seem less monstrous themselves. When they get blind-drunk, cheat, steal, beat their wives, starve an old woman, when they kill a trapped fox with an axe or riddle the last existing unicorn with arrows, they like to think that the Bane entering cottages at daybreak is more monstrous than they are. They feel better then. They find it easier to live‚Äù",books,2953
"Back in the 80s, Anne Rice wrote some erotic fiction, a bold retelling of Sleeping Beauty. She even used a pseudonym.

I found it when I was too young to question it a lot, I was only surprised to accidentaly find heavily sexual content and kept reading out of curiosity.

A short description: the very beginning is the fairytale you know. But the prince wakes the princess through sex (rape? Well, read it and give your opinion, that's what I'd like to debate here.) Instead of treating her with love and respect, he begins a series of what I suppose is BDSM fetish. Sexual humiliation. She goes from an innocent, sheltered virgin to a sex slave in a kingdom that isn't her own.

I thought: ""Well, I doubt I'd bear reading that as the person I am today, but I'll give it a try.""

I gave it a try.

Somehow it isn't disturbing.

The violence isn't absurd.

I think this is more like dark erotica than rape, rape. You feel shocked and slightly horny by it. The details aren't grisly, they're rather provoking.",books,1008

"A few years ago I made a short film where I travelled around Europe and left books in random destinations for strangers to find. It was part of a project where I left notes inside the book, encouraging readers to take the book home, read it, leave their details inside the book, and then leave it somewhere for another stranger.

I had this grandiose idea of these books travelling around the world, accumulating names and a shared reading experience. It didn't quite pan out - only one of the books was picked up (in Paris). 

I'm thinking of returning to this project one day, but wondered, how many readers are likely to pick up a book if they found it in the street, in good condition? I know I would (and have) but is this common, or would readers generally ignore them?

Here's the film I made if anyone would like to check it out: [www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhjIJaBKDFs&amp;t=](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhjIJaBKDFs&amp;t=)

I'm so disappointed. I read The Hunting Party first and absolutely LOVED it. I breezed through it as an ebook and placed The Guest List on hold. After finishing it, I felt like they were the exact. same. book. For example:

1. Both star a group of old friends with one interloper


2. Both are set in some far away place where nature prevents anyone from getting in or out at crucial points


3. The narrative structure is identical; we switch POVs between the past and the present


4. Something happens to someone in the middle and we don't find out who until the end


5. The end is, of course, a twist

"I read this graphic novel a few weeks ago, (I am a big Satrapi fan) and I don‚Äôt know what it is about this graphic novel, but the story just stuck with me.

"My wife has been reading the Stephanie Plum series by Janet Evanovich (she is on book 13 right now) and on occasion she will take note of reused character names. The most common one seems to be ""Ziggy."" It feels like there have been at least 7 different characters named Ziggy so far, none related to each other in any way. No characters mention how odd it is that there are 7 different Ziggys in town.

This seems like a very strange (bad) writing choice that I've never personally encountered. How do these novels keep succeeding with such lazy writing? I'm tempted to pick them up myself just to make a chart explaining all the Ziggy. If someone could explain them to me, that would save me a lot of trouble.

"I've been in the mood for Virginia Woolf lately! Two weeks ago, I finished A Room of One's Own and mostly loved it. Woolf's personality really drew me in. 

Immediately after that, I read Mrs. Dalloway, which I also enjoyed, although I'll need to reread it to take it all in. I really liked the stream-of-consciousness style despite it being difficult to read, and I found that she put things into words that I've never been able to describe myself. She's very perceptive and, on top of that, very eloquent. She notices all the important - albeit little - details of daily life.

I started reading Orlando: A Biography yesterday, and I'm finding it very interesting and engaging so far. It seems quite different from Mrs. Dalloway. I really appreciate Woolf's ability to experiment with her writing, and I'm definitely planning on reading most (if not all) of her work at some point.

"I was thinking about making physical book props for a tabletop RPG. It won't happen anytime soon, but it got me thinking.

Physical books so rarely take advantage of the fact that they're *physical* books, in a 3-dimensional space.

There's a book called *The Dragonology Handbook,* and it takes advantage of the fact that it's a physical book in small and fun ways. It has a little envelope with a small letter inside, for instance. It's been a while since I read the book, but I loved it back in elementary school.

Regardless, it seems I'm not naturally suited for novels in that when I start I often find it difficult to picture anything that's happening or even remember names or have a set idea of what, say, a person looks like... I really have difficult creating a non real human in my mind that isn't just someone I know with maybe a different hair colour...

Fantastic, would be the only way I could describe Sarah J Maas‚Äô latest novel, Crescent City. 
Crime, love, magic, danger...there is something for everyone in this book. Maas‚Äô storytelling has a way of ripping your heart out one minute then mending it together so beautifully the next it leaves the reader speechless. Her main character, Bryce, has been solidified as one of my favorite characters of all time. Despite how flawed she is, Bryce‚Äôs spirit, willingness to forgive, and loyalty to those she loves was amazing to read. The relationships are what made this story for me. The deep love the friendships possessed were so profoundly moving it drove the story home. Seriously, I was ugly crying at probably three different points in this book. The world itself is so unique with hints of real world things through out, it made the story that much more enjoyable. A very captivating story of just how powerful love truly is. I cannot wait for books two and three. Sarah J. Maas is simply brilliant. 
Huge disclaimer: 
I have a lot of friends who read my reviews, looking for stuff for their kids to read. This is not one for your kids!

In other words, what retailer would you recommend buying artbooks, and books in general? Anyone has any experiences with Walmart? Barnes &amp; Noble?

What is bothering me is - it is a time turner! Since they already know what happened in the past, why limit to just turning it back 3 hours? They can turn it back 6 hours or heck even 24 hours or a week ahead - they can go to Hagrid's house and get Scabbers out of there and lock him up. They can then just search and approach the black dog using their invisibility cloak. 

Also, why are they making a big deal out of going to the hospital on time? If they are not able to make it, just go back 10 mins and get into the hospital? Or if the time turner can only turn back in hourly increments, then go back andhour, wait outside and just go in 5 minutes before?

"If you spend any time in amateur writing communities, you'll know that one of the most common questions new writers have these days is ""am I allowed to write characters who aren't like me?"" Can white authors write Black protagonists? Can straight authors write gay protagonists? Etc.

For a long time, one popular response has been: Yes, because that's ultimately what fiction *is*. When Zadie Smith wrote about the subject, for example, she titled her essay ""[Fascinated to Presume: In Defense of Fiction](https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2019/10/24/zadie-smith-in-defense-of-fiction/)"", and wrote things such as:
&gt;it would be easy enough at this point to march onward and write a triumphalist defense of fiction, ridiculing those who hold the very practice in suspicion‚Äîthe type of reader who wonders how a man wrote Anna Karenina

In short, ""writing the other"" is not just one kind of fiction, it *is* fiction. If we weren't allowed to write about people who are different from ourselves, the only thing left would be self-inserts, memoirs, autobiography, etc. Which, *obviously*, would be unthinkable.

And yet... along comes autofiction. It's as if the literary fiction community heard that *reductio ad absurdum* argument and decided to choose the absurd future where fiction itself comes to an end.

Am I wrong to make this connection? Maybe I'm being overly cynical, but it seems to me that the rise in popularity of autofiction has nothing to do with literary merit and everything to do with the political climate. I want to be wrong, because if I'm not... well... as fan of fiction, I don't like where this is headed.",books,1832
Ok so in chapter 15 Abby Black (who is like in her late 40s) offers to kiss Oskar Schell (who isn‚Äôt even a teenager at this point). Am I reading that right? Like on the cheek?

"Ok does anybody else ever read a book or a series and then as soon as they finished they feel depressed.

So midnight sun came out and I bought it and read it in one day. Couldn't put it down. Then felt weird so went back and read the entirety of the Twilight series again. As I read them as a teenager so figured it was time to re-read.

After all that I then discovered on Google there was a book called life and death where she had rewrote Twilight but everybody had swapped genders.

I read that and actually enjoyed it more than the original Twilight. Beau was a lot more fun than Bella. And Edythe was less of a miserable b*tch comapred to Edward. 

Then once I had read and googled everything I got my boyfriend to watch all the films with me. 

And now, I'm done. There is not single piece of Twilight I can read or watch. And I don't know what to do with myself.

I feel numb and confused and sad. And it's not just this series, I do it all the time with other series and things. I binge them, don't sleep or eat or anything until I've finished each book or whatever.

Then once I finish one, I have a nap or snack and then continue. I read midnight sun 4 days ago. Then obviously moved onto the twilight series as normal. Then life and death. Then the film's. All in 4 days. 

Does anybody else get like that or am I just a freak hahaha I'm genuinely curious If books affect other people this way",books,1406

"I'm really sorry if this is a stupid question but it's something I think about a lot and would be interested in hearing others' thoughts about it. Hopefully my question makes sense, it's a little hard for to explain.

I'm the kind of person (a perfectionist) who really wants to understand everything I read in a book (such as allusions to other works or historical context, that kind of thing) and so when I read a book I always try to get an annotated version. It's been a long time since I've actually read something with annotations though and so when I picked up ""Lolita"" to reread it, I found myself getting a little frustrated with flipping from the front to the back where the annotations are every few lines.

I was just wondering how others utilize annotations when they read. Do you read and then when you see an annotated line flip to the back to check out the notes? Or maybe there's some other way of going about this? My other question is, how do you utilize annotations when they're given in the back but the lines in the book aren't marked with any numbers (so you aren't able to tell which lines have annotations)?",books,1132

"Despite always wanting to finish books and seek out new works, I‚Äôve never been much of a reader.

It‚Äôs hard for me to read sometimes because I form obsessions about making sure I‚Äôve understood **everything** that I read on the page. (OCD) 

I‚Äôve recently started reading Jurassic Park by Michael Crichton and I‚Äôm really enjoying it. It feels different than other times I‚Äôve started books. The other times it felt mostly like I was just reading so that I could say that I finished a book. So I would pick something that was suppose to be good and tried to read it. 

With this it‚Äôs different. I actually feel more interested and compelled by Crichton‚Äôs writing. I feel a connection to the author. But the actual act of reading still feels a little difficult. Sometimes finishing 3 pages feel like I have been lifting weights with my brain. 

Has anyone else experienced this? Any insights?",books,888

"Ready Player One for me, without a doubt. 

I should preface by saying I do understand why the book and movie couldn't be exactly alike. I believe that to license all the different music and movie pieces they would have needed to recreate the book would have likely been too expensive to be worth the risk. 

However, this movie had none of the fun of the book. The book was one of the few I couldn't stop reading. I'd stay up late and wake up early to read this book. I was dying to see how the puzzles would play out, to see Parzivals fortness and them working through some of these quests.  The movie wasn't even a shadow of what the book was.",books,646

For example, booktuber Jenna Moreci has recently put up on her social media that her second novel, The Savior's Champion, is now a certified bestseller after hitting #1 On Amazon's Epic Fantasy list. For whatever reason I seriously doubted this so went to check, and the only public ranking evidence put the book 9,952nd on that list.

Is there some other metric for determining the bestseller title now, or have I just missed something obvious?

Or, god forbid, is Moreci just lying about her sales?",books,684

We released our Paris episode today, where we talk about:

* Vintage 1954 by Antoine Laurain (a whimsical time-travel romp)
* The Invention of Hugo Cabret by Brian Selznik (the graphic novel that inspired the movie 'Hugo')
* The Godmother by Hannelore Cayre (a contemporary crime page-turner)
* The Only Street in Paris: Life on the Rue de Martyrs by Elaine Sciolino (non-fiction about a street where the author lives)
* Little by Edward Carey (a mostly true biography of Madame Tussaud, the wax museum founder)
* Tasting Paris by Clotilde Dusoulier (a cookbook that is also a travel guide)

(Yes, that's six books. Sometimes, we throw an extra in. Because books!)

In two weeks, we'll be covering Alaska. We have past episodes about Chicago, Japan, Scotland, and nine others. You can see [our whole schedule and previously released podcasts here](https://strongsenseofplace.com/podcasts).

"I've recently been making it a point to read booked that have been turned into popular, trendy movies. Hunger games, Harry Potter, maze runner, Percy Jackson, so on and so forth. 

Hunger games was by far the truest to the books of all I've read so far. I was impressed. 

Harry Potter, well, that's been talked about endlessly and I don't think I need to say anything about that. 

Maze runner though. It blows my mind how a production company can just change an entire story. Like ""hey, those books were really well written, and people seemed to enjoy them. Let's make them into movies, except, let's entirely change every aspect""

Percy Jackson books are amazing, no matter how young or old you are. The fact that there is what, 17 books? all taking place in the same world. Percy Jackson, Magnus chase, heroes of Olympus, and Apollo. Amazing, I love it. It's been awhile since I've seen the movies though, so I can't be a fair judge of that. But I've heard that they are a far cry from the books.

"Hey all, I just joined this subreddit to try and work on this poor character trait I have of hating books. So a little bit of a backstory. I moved to the west at around 6 years of age and ever since I got here, I‚Äôve been forced to read and I hated it,  I absolutely hated having something shoved down my throat. Eventually when I got to around grade 2 or 3, I stopped going to the library and picking up books. I would still read here and there but it would be very minimal. I would barely read the assigned novels and texts in school, but somehow, I got by. A year ago I started university back in my home country of Egypt and to my surprise, a lot of my friends were book worms! I would sit around them and they would talk about philosophy or sociology or politics or any other topic you can think of. Their arsenal of complex vocabulary and intricate sentence structures were a work of art. I felt ashamed that I wasn‚Äôt like that and I really want to get back into reading so I can further grow and develop myself as a person. Any advice on how or where to start?",books,1066

"Many poets have answered your question in their poems.

1.
When You Are Old

by William Butler Yeats

How many loved your moments of glad grace,

And loved your beauty with love false or true;

But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you,

And loved the sorrows of your changing face;

2.
The First Kiss of Love

by Lord Byron

When age chills the blood, when our pleasures are past.

For years fleet away with the wings of the dove.

The dearest remembrance will still be the last.

Our sweetest memorial the first kiss of love.

3.
A Red Red Rose

by Robert Burns

O my love is like a red, red rose,

That‚Äôs newly sprung in June;

O my love is like the melody,

That's sweetly played in tune.

4.
The Rose in The Deeps of His Heart

by William Butler Yeats

With the earth and the sky and the water,

remade, like a casket of gold,

For my dreams of your image that blossoms,

a rose in the deeps of my heart.

5.
Love's Philosophy

by Percy Bysshe Shelley

And the sunlight clasps the earth,

And the moonbeams kiss the sea;

What are all these kissings worth,

If thou kiss not me.

6.
A Glimpse

by Walt Whitman

A long while amid the noises of coming and going,

of drinking and oath and smutty jest,

There we two, content, happy in being together,

speaking little, perhaps not a word.

7.
I loved you first: but afterwards your love...

by Christina Rossetti

I loved you first, but afterwards your love outsoaring mine,

..For one is both and both are one in love:

Rich love knows nought of ‚Äòthine that is not mine;

Both have the strength and both the length thereof,

Both of us, of the love which makes us one.

She Walks in Beauty

She walks in beauty, like the night

Of cloudless climes and starry skies;

And all that's best of dark and brightÔºõ

Meet in her aspect and her eyes.

But bears it out even to the edge of doom.

If this be error and upon me proved.

I saw that there are 2 versions of the book - Illustrated and the original. So I wondered if there are meaningful changes made to the illustrated that will make me want the original.

The two of them meet up later up and go to an old military weapon testing ground which had domes and other buildings, in one of the domes they find a trap door and found that it leads to an old underground research facility, when they were done searching it they came above ground and the military started  testing weaponry again (it is good to note that the military had no idea they were there) another thing, the military were killing off endangered falcons that were roaming near the area.

"After stumbling through ""Four Generations under one Roof,"" It would be a lie to say That I was aroused by any patriotic fervour.

I have seen too many things, I can't hate, I only feel pity for them, only feel sad.

What saddens me most is something other than books -- Lao She herself. So much he loved Peiping, as if every river there were his blood, or plot of dirt were his body, or every gust of wind breathed his breath.

I knew he hated it. He wrote about how the Japanese had abused Peiping and how shameless the traitors were. He was gnashing his teeth. He recalled the traditions and petty business of Peiping tenderly for a moment, described the depression of Peiping bitterly for a moment, sneered at the badness of the Japanese for a moment, and was trapped in the conflict of Ruisuan style.

Lao She is the collection of all characters. Is the old man Qi mellow gentle, is god bless's honest silence, is Ruixuan's elegant struggle, is the money poet clank iron bone. When a culture is too frayed, people fall into an unspeakable division. Peiping is too familiar.

Lao She cursed and hated foreign enemies. Even for the traitors, he said they were ""boring"". He took great pains to arrange a happy ending for the novel -- he still loved Peiping and its people. He also believed in his love. He thought that without Japan, Peiping people would live in peace and harmony, and the Qi family would live under the same roof from one generation to the next, four or even five generations.

Who ever thought that he was driven to the end by his beloved Peiping.

Lao She was beaten to a pulp that day and could not stand up. Some people feared that he would be killed on the spot and dragged him to a nearby police station. Several Red guards heard that he was a ""counter-revolutionary"", and immediately entered the room and you kicked him a few times. Knowing that it was evening, I went to the police station and helped him back home.

The next day, I heard that I was not long away from home, Lao She arranged his clothes, took a copy of Chairman MAO poetry went out. When he got to the yard, he saw his four-year-old granddaughter playing there. He called her to him, took her by the hand and said, ""Say goodbye to grandpa."" When Lao She left home, she walked straight north to The Taiping Lake (which is now gone and turned into a subway parking lot), where she sat and read the Poem by Chairman MAO. He read for a whole day, and after dark he dropped headfirst, feet up, into the still water of the lake.

Find the next day afternoon, just someone told me, Taiping Lake there is an old man drowned dead, it seems to be Lao she. I found the lake and saw that he had been fished out, flat on the ground. There was blood running from his nose and mouth. He was wearing a white shirt and blue trousers. His black shoes with thousands of soles and his white socks were clean. It can be seen that he buried his head in the water, with his hands hard clinging to the lake cliff stones drowned.

(Mrs. Lao She's memory of history, excerpted from Memories of Taiping Lake -- The Death of Lao She)

How could he be willing to bid farewell to his beloved Peiping in such a tragic manner, if it were not for the wrenching pain and unbearable mental torture? The Poet Qian in ""Four Generations Under one Umbrella"" endured the mistreatment of the Japanese, but he still persevered and kept his eyes wide open until the day of liberation. Mr. Lao she could do the same, I suppose, if it was the Japanese who tortured him.

But no, it was the Chinese he loved so much. In the face of foreign enemies, you may be able to endure humiliation for the sake of the nation, but in the face of our own people, everyone is inevitably divided: Am I right? If everyone, all Chinese compatriots, all Peiping compatriots, say that I am wrong, then how can I prove that I am not wrong? How do I know I'm not really wrong?

But if I'm wrong, what's wrong with me? What's wrong with too much love? Or was it a mistake to write it out?

Perhaps you can think of ""four Generations under one Roof"" in qi Tianyou was killed by drowning himself in the water, Lao She unexpectedly wrote his death is beautiful, write vividly, write such as see such as smell, as if his soul also died at this moment once.

If you are a fatalist, you may be more sensible.

But in China at that time, everyone could see their destiny: one day, you might be the one tortured to death by the ""revolutionary masses"" today.

Love too much, can not bear from the other side of a little hurt.

I don't know why I always feel so sad about Lao She. I can hardly even think of his appearance at once.

I think China should be more tolerant nowadays. I think the ideology that can unify China is beginning to fade away. I don't like the Little Red Book. I don't like it at all. I don't like blue clothes and blue pants. I thought the Chinese were finally starting to value ""the individual"", finally learning to think for themselves, and finally having a mind independent of ""the official"".

I've always thought of myself as a pessimist, but it seems that my estimate is still too optimistic.

When will the Chinese learn to love themselves and stop doing things that show they are not worthy of being loved?

When will we learn to love and be loved properly, correctly and tenderly.",books,5328

"I love non-fiction and probably read it 9 non-fiction books to every fiction. I try to read things that expand my knowledge or improve myself as a person. However, I've in my latest declutter, I don't know if I can say that any book has actually impacted me enough where it made me change the way I live or provided me knowledge that was actionable. Now, I'm putting the blame on the books, not myself, and I already realize that at this moment. But I've read a fair share of books, but I can only conclude that amongst all the non-fiction books I've read, I've probably only gotten entertainment out of them, not actionable knowledge. Here are a few books I've most enjoyed throughout the past year or two: 

* Albert Einstiein by Walter Isaacson (read a bunch of other Isaacson books but I find them all too entertaining and not really changing me as a person) 
* Elon Must by Ashlee Vance (these biographies are actually making me feel bad about myself. these people are too accomplished) 
* How to Change Your Mind by Michael Pollan (i actually tried shrooms, but I didn't need the book to convince me. Just entertainment) 
* The Go Programming Language by Donavan and Kerninghan (I ended up reading the PDF, despite buying the hardcover, since it was much more searchable).
* Mindfulness in Plain English by Gunaratana (Meditation hasn't worked out for me) 
* How to Stop Worrying and Start Living by Dale Carnagie (My stress is still here. I've tried a few little things here and there) 
* Man's search for meaning - Victor Frankl (Very sad. I've read a bunch of other holocaust related books but I just feel sad and do nothing) 
* Virtue of Selfishness - Ayn Ran (Good points, but I still am the same person, not any more selfish) 
* The Mind Illuminated - John Yates (I did actually meditate for 1 hour a day for 1 month but found no difference in my life) 
* A Brief History of Time - Stephen Hawking (I love astrophysics, but damn, it's just entertainment. It is too late for me to switch my career into this kind of field) 
* The Fabric of the Cosmos - Brian Greene (same).

"I saw the movie JoJo Rabbit first, and it wasn't until I saw the movie that I knew it was based off the book, ""Caging Skies."" Of course, I had to read it right away. To my dismay, I felt the book to be a bit lackluster; and definitely feel that the movie adaptation is better. But I am not sure if I am missing something important in the book because i saw the movie first. I fear that by seeing the movie first may have ruines my interpretation/expectation of the novel. Am I acting crazy or over analyzing this entire situation??",books,531
"Hi, I just finished The Sea Wolf and was curious what others thought of the book.

I really enjoyed it. For being written in 1904 it did not feel dated or unrelatable like some of the old books/classics I‚Äôve read. I enjoyed London as an author, he was fun and his style was a joy to read.

The love story parts of the book weren‚Äôt bad, but definitely weren‚Äôt my favorite parts. The book kind of reminded me of After Many A Summer Dies The Swan by Alduous Huxley in the way that the most interesting parts were when the main character was talking with another character with opposing views. However, overall I think The Sea Wolf is much better as the characters are much more interesting and the nonconversation parts were still fun and intense. This is my first Jack London book and I plan to read more.

Now to the best part, Wolf Larsen. What a character! So interesting and strong. One of the onlys books I can think of where I was sad for the ‚Äúvillain‚Äù. He just really is the whole book. Not that Hump was bad, in fact I rather liked him and his arc/growth, but Wolf Larsen is just a wow character. I gave the book a 4/5 and if you have not read it before I would highly suggest giving it a read!",books,1200

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Waiting_Dog) it was published by Kid Can Press Toronto, so I don't think it was distributed outside the Toronto area.

"I just listened to the Audible version and I have to say, I've probably never had more mixed emotions over a book. I've been listening and physically reading a lot of long fantasy books this year and thought this would be a good short book to get through. It took me about a week of listening off and on to finish it.

On one hand, it pulled me in right away. I love that X Files, Twin Peaks vibe it has. This was especially great as I didn't need 200-300 pages of world building to be hooked. The mystery just kept getting more mysterious and bizarre.

But then the end came. I was so disappointed. The explanation was so flat and easily explained. Maybe it was due to the 9 hour run time, but I had little connection to anybody but Ethan, certainly not the antagonist. There was no time for him to form bonds or break them or feel for anyone else.

Then there is the problem of, should I read on? It has two sequels, but now it just seems like it will be a political game. It's why I don't really like the sequels to The Hunger Games. Maybe I'm wrong on how the series progresses, the big hook seems to be gone and I don't have a vested interest in how anybody turns out.

There is no greater meaning or reward at the end for the sufferers. It is what it is. Life being hard, cold and bleak with happiness not being a reward for _being a Christ Figure_

"Hi all,

As the title suggests, I am an avid and dedicated reader, loving it more and more as I get older, though I was the same as a child. I was the kid that took books to restaurants and read while my parents ate, that snuck reading time under the covers with a flashlight past my bedtime, and enjoyed reading my own choices in between those assigned during school and college. As I've grown into my adult years, the passion has withstood every obstacle I've faced in life and - if anything - grown more so. However...

I've begun to notice in the last few years that it is harder for me to read. My TBR list is growing and growing, as it has always done, but it takes me longer to finish books now, no matter the length. Even books I am thoroughly enjoying take me much longer to complete than they used to. I spent days during summer vacation reading overnight when a new Harry Potter book was released and devoured books that came into my possession that took me on journeys I could have never imagined. Now, as an adult, I am quite aware that I may not be able to do these things anymore haha. But, it seems to have reached a level where I am not happy whatsoever. It has made me sad, quite so actually, feeling as though I am losing something I truly love without an idea as to why or even a way to help remedy the situation.

I seem to either have trouble focusing or retaining (and perhaps they go hand in hand). I used to be able to read for hours, and now I find that difficult. I am happy if I get 30 minutes completed, and find it where days pass where I don't read at all (something almost sacrilegious in my life). I don't have any issues with eye strain or finding proper ways to sit or relax while reading, I truly have an issue with just needing to ***keep*** reading.

I was wondering if anyone else has dealt with something like this, or if there is anything one would suggest I could try? I'm seeking insight from other bibliophiles, or even a story similar if that exists. It just feels so down heartening right now, as though I am losing a true piece of my being. I'm open to anything at this time (even suggestions for consulting medical professionals outside of the whole Reddit universe altogether if someone sees it like that), as I'm willing to consider anything at this point. 

All insight is greatly appreciated, and thank you for your time.",books,2373

"Gene Wolfe's Book of the New Sun was published in four parts, as [*The Shadow of the Torturer*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60211.The_Shadow_of_the_Torturer), [*The Claw of the Conciliator*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/463376.The_Claw_of_the_Conciliator), [*The Sword of the Lictor*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/463378.The_Sword_of_the_Lictor), and [*The Citadel of the Autarch*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/299758.The_Citadel_of_the_Autarch). It tells the story of Severian, an apprentice of the torturers' guild, who undertakes a long and undulating journey through the bizarre lands of Urth. Totalling a little over 1000 pages, the books are written in the style of a memoir with a notoriously unreliable narration.

The story is about many things, but what I noticed most of all were compelling ideas about memory, truth, identity, and time. Right from the start, Severian claims to have a perfect memory, but does he really recall everything as they were? If not, is he lying to us? This is a sticking point for most readers, and, combined with some crazy warping of identity and time, makes for a marvellously disorienting and psychedelic experience.

The Book of the New Sun doesn't seem to be discussed much outside of a few enclaves of hardcore SF/F readers, probably due to its reputation of being dense, labyrinthine, and outright incomprehensible at times. Characters are often described as one-dimensional and bewildering, and the plot, when it can be followed, as one of many straightforward instances of the hero's journey. Fairly or otherwise, Wolfe has earned comparisons to Melville and Joyce. 

There is truth in all that has been said, but my experience as someone who hasn't read any Gene Wolfe - or much SF/F, for that matter - has been overwhelmingly positive. I felt lost, enthralled, frustrated, and repulsed, often all at once. I was shocked to realise I'd finished the whole thing in two weeks. 

These books are frequently described as literary puzzles; in order to make any sense of the story, one must presumably analyse every word in painstaking detail, cross-reference them with musty lexicons, and take copious notes, preferably on a Crazy Wall. This is a gross exaggeration. While Wolfe peppers his story with many, many archaic terms, the surface plot is easy to follow, and most events are eventually explained by Severian. The story as told by Severian is enjoyable on its own, but when you notice glaring inconsistencies and unspoken details, you start to pay closer attention and peer between the lines. Some books need to be re-read to be enjoyed, but this isn't one of them. If you re-read this, it's only because you already like it enough on the first time to dive in and discover all the nitty-gritty details you missed.

The prose itself is elegant but simple, and the archaic words lend their own distinctive charm. Many of them are taken straight from ancient Greek, and they say a lot about the Urth of Severian's era. I got the impression that none of the words are made up, and even the ones that don't appear in standard dictionaries have clear roots in the languages and mythologies of our own world. The [*Lexicon Urthus*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5970607-lexicon-urthus) is a valuable supplement with definitions for these obscure words, but it also contains spoilers, which may not be ideal on a first read; I found a simple Google search to suffice whenever I was desperate to look up a particular term.

I was hooked from the beginning by the unique setting. The lines between fantasy and sci-fi are blurry at best here, if they even exist. While this kind of science fantasy setting isn't uncommon, it's so seamless and authentic that it feels like a living, breathing world that we've been dropped into. The atmosphere is hauntingly beautiful, with lush and vivid scenery belying a sense of decay and finality. The series is sometimes compared to [Dark Souls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Souls), not just in storytelling style, but also in terms of ambience and tone.

Perhaps more difficult for me than the archaic terminology and obtuse narration was Severian's misogyny. It's important to distinguish between the author and their characters, and I also know nothing about Wolfe's personal views in this matter. However, that doesn't make it easier to read about Severian's reprehensible thoughts and actions towards the women he encounters. I say this not to criticise, but to give any potential readers fair warning, because while the misogyny isn't very graphic, it rears its ugly head throughout all four parts of the story.

That aside, it's clear that Severian is a complex and layered character whose narration colours the entire story, and isn't necessarily a hero we should root for, insofar as there are heroes in this story. I found the other characters equally intriguing and even more enigmatic, and it's a real joy to puzzle out their backstories and motivations.

Some advice from a first-time reader of The Book of the New Sun to potential readers: don't worry about missing details. The story holds up really well even if you don't spot them all. Be patient, and most questions will be answered in time. It's easy to put down the book for a while and pick it up again, thanks to the short chapters. This series is divisive and isn't for everyone. Despite loving it, it has also been a somewhat exhausting experience. I highly recommend trying [*Shadow*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60211.The_Shadow_of_the_Torturer) and finishing at least that; if you dislike it, it's safe to say you wouldn't enjoy the rest of The Book of the New Sun.

Whilst I take a break from Gene Wolfe, I plan to check out the [subreddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/genewolfe/) and the [Alzabo Soup podcast](https://alzabosoup.libsyn.com/), which I've had to force myself to stay away from in fear of spoilers. I haven't fallen down a rabbit hole this deep in a while.

"Over the last 3 weeks alone I've read and finished 4 books!! 

- Axiom's End by Lindsay Ellis
- Alias Grace by Margaret Atwood
- The Song of Achilles by Madeline Miller
- Dark Matter by Blake Crouch 

I graduated from university a year ago and I found my reading habits slipping - reading for pleasure became very very hard when you'd be digesting academic source after academic source for essays and my dissertation. But I think I've finally got back into the swing of things (and Goodreads is my best friend now!!), and I genuinely can't wait to get through all of the books that I have waiting on my 'to read' list. 

I think something else I've come to terms with is that it's okay if you don't like a book, or don't gel with it. Before I was adamant that I had to finish a book come what may, but recently I've been adding a few 'DNF' books to my shelves and officially calling it a day with some titles. It feels good to be able to say 'I tried, but not for me', instead of suffering through page after page of writing that I'm not invested in.",books,1050
"This is probably about my 4th read through the book and I can honestly say it never gets any easier, but I love it.

In my opinion, its a book that defiantly lives up to the hype in the controversial sense. I'm not bothered about violence in media but the acts Bateman carries out (particularly later in the book) even I find hard to read.  
However it's not the graphic scenes that I find so disturbing, its the descriptions of Bateman's deteriorating state of mind, his shallow, obsessive, insecure way of living and the lives of everyone surrounding him.  
A chapter that really sticks with me is Summer - his trip away with Everyln where he describes (to most people) the dream of a young couple; breakfast in bed, walks on the beach, writing poetry, playing tennis, buying her gifts - including a dog, and all the things anyone would consider beautiful in a relationship.   
But neither seem bothered by it. Everyln takes repeat trips home to get facials and manicures while Patrick struggles to control his reality and bloodlust - eating sand, cooking a jellyfish and standing over Everyln at night holding an icepick. For me it's just such a sad, disturbing part of the book, it shows how empty both Bateman and the world he lives in really is. The dog he eventually drowns but Everyln doesn't really notice.  


American Psycho is honestly one of the most bleak but absolutely fascinating books i've ever read.   
It's also insanely re-readable, not only because of how interesting it is but of how its written, I sometimes dont read for weeks at a time and it's a great book for being able to do that.

I bought Less Than Zero a few days ago and plan to crack on with that once i've finished AS, i'm expecting good things (as I also enjoyed Lunar Park).

The book is about the first world war. It describes the events from differents points of vue beetween 1913 and 1920. The points of vue are represented by differents characters that lives in differents countries : Russia, France, England, USA, Germany.

As the book goes on, interactions are created beetween the differents characters, so links are created as the book goes on.

The book is written to be easily understood, so everyone could read it.

The differents events are the same as the real ones, so reading it helped me to remember my history lessons.

If you have any other questions about the book, ask me in the comments.",books,816
"Just finished this beautiful piece of literature, that too LGBT no less. Packs so much emotions for such a small read. The characters are beautiful. Fell in love with Maurice and Scudder is my hero. Not so sure how I feel about Clive. I mean he sure had his reasons to spring that nasty surprise on Maurice. And the prose itself is so beautiful. I know I am late in reading it but I dont regret it one bit. Would love to read more such classic pieces of well written LGBT literature",books,482
"Few days ago i went to a book store just to give some looks on fresh books. And i found out a book which i red in korean about 10 years ago. (For better understanding i wanna give you a short information of me. Im Korean and living in Germany since almost 6 years ago.) That book is 'The happiness of Architecture' by Alain de Botton. As i said, because i red it already 10 years ago, i was surprised that it came out now in Germany. Maybe it was just coincidentally in the 'New' section idk. Then i started to read it, because i was kinda curious about how does it be translated from Englisch to German, in comparison to from Englisch to Korean. That wasnt my first time reading books in different languages, because im trying to learn languages through books sometimes. And still it was so interesting to find and understand like small differences in context or nuances. So that the book gives sort of other perspective somehow. I think its because each languges are created in certain way of the unique thinking system of people who use it and sometimes there is like words that you cannot translate to others. Had you guys also this kind of experiences? How was your impression and thoughts?",books,1195
"I‚Äôm really into mysteries and suspense books, but lately it seems like all of them are told from the point of view of, like, 4 or more narrators.

"So I have recently begun acquiring any cheap Stephen King 1st ed. hardbacks that I come across for a decent price, and just managed to get a set of 4 on ebay, one of which was 'The Eyes of the Dragon' (which I am very excited to read!).

While checking prices of these books individually to check that I was getting a good deal, I noticed that the American version of TEOTD (which has an absolutely gorgeous cover, btw) sells for significantly more than the UK version, both 1st editions.

Is this usually the case, that UK 1st editions typically sell for less than their American counterparts, or are there other factors at play?

TL;DR: Are UK 1st edition books worth less than US 1st editions?",books,696
"I have just finished **Crime and punishment** and I really enjoyed it. It was the longest book I've ever read and also the first of such genre. People have recommended me to read **Anna karenina** and it seems like a really sad story when I read the review/summary. Now I am in a bit dilemma here, I know the book is a great work of literature so I want to read it but at the same time it feels like a very emotional exhausting book. I am very sensitive and I empathize too much. So, I don't like reading books that will leave me in a state of hopeless despair. So, should I read this book or not?",books,597

"I have been reading frequently for the first time in many years and even though I manage to blend all outside noises out while reading, I can't ignore my body position.

"I don't remember how exactly I came across this book, but I saw somewhere that it was described as what Drarry fans didn't get from Harry Potter; that's a pretty accurate representation, though Baz is more a mix of Draco and Remus (Remus because he hates the part of him that's a vampire.) 

It took me a *while* to get into this book. They're split up into ""books"" within the book (basically sections) and it took me the whole first 'book"" to actually get into it. I never fully felt like I grasped the world, it felt like I had picked up Deathly Hallows and was missing a number of books. Fangirl was written before this, but Rainbow has said that she thinks you should be able to read it as a stand-alone -- I haven't read Fangirl yet, it's next on the list so I'm not sure if it'll help at all -- but I really felt like it was part of a series, not the first book.   
Another issue I had was changing POVs constantly. It does *mostly* stay in Simon's POV, but it bounces around a lot at times.&gt;! Especially during Simon and Baz's first kiss, it literally changes POVs like 5 times in 2 pages, bouncing back and forth between them. !&lt; It felt like Rainbow wasn't sure how else to give us certain information without changing POVs a lot, but there are some points of view where you're like ""who are you and why do I care?"" and you don't figure out why they matter until later.   
I found Agatha *extremely* unlikeable, so I was glad she wasn't around much. 

Once I got to the second book/section, I did start liking it better, and ended up finishing it in about a day. The ending gave an actual really nice twist I probably should've seen coming but didn't (though there was a twist within the twist I had no way of seeing coming.) I also kind of liked how hopeless Simon was as magic. A lot of times you see the ""Chosen One"" or special characters (ex. Clary Fray from the Shadowhunters chronicles going from Mundane to super powerful Shadowhunter) being super great, even if they never knew the world existed before... and a lot of time it's okay, it makes the story interesting, but Simon being a complete idiot felt super nice and realistic.   
&gt;!I really hated the fact Rainbow decided to give Simon wings and a tail though. It feels really tacky.!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

The book ended on a nice note though, it's clear Rainbow wasn't sure if she would write more or not, so she closed it up enough to stand alone if you don't want to read Wayward Son or Anyway The Wind Blows (I think that's #3's title...) but it leaves enough that having more books doesn't feel forced.   
I do plan to read Wayward Son, but I've been warned it leaves on a cliffhanger, so I'm waiting until book #3 comes out, just in case. 

Final verdict: if its at your local library/available on an online library and you like fantasy, especially fantasy with LGBTQ+ stuff, I'd say give it a shot... just be warned, it may take a number of chapters to get into it.   
I'd give it like a 3.7 out of 5.",books,2986
"I just finished Find Me by Andr√© Aciman. Now this is not a terrible review on the book because I did enjoy it to an extent. 
However everything about the cover, blurb and reviews are extremely misleading. It just isn‚Äôt a sequel to Call me by your name. 
If you used the term in a very thin sense it has the same characters and the last 20 so pages are a continuation of the first novel. 
But other then that it is an entirely different structure. The book was promoted as another book following Oliver and Elio. Elio‚Äôs story doesn‚Äôt start until well over 100 pages in and Oliver the very end. 
I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs a bad Novel but I feel disappointed as it‚Äôs purposefully misleading to coast on the success of the Call me by your name film fan base. It entire marketing campaign just feels like a trick. It tarnishes what could have been a good story.",books,850

The story as I remember it revolves around romance, for some reason a man and a woman are staying in an old castle of some kind (I don't remember why) and a ghost haunts the place. The duration of the book is spent solving the ghosts mystery, and the ghost essentially forcing romance between the man and woman by locking doors, giving them dreams i think, etc. Any help or guesses is welcome!

I've recently had a few situations with people at work that have pushed me to defend my progressive viewpoints (against one guy who was arguing anti-racists are as bad as racists; and a group of people who were upset at me pointing out bigotry or hate signs because I was trying to educate them on issues).

"A brief yet compellingly nuanced take on regret, nostalgia, and the subjectivity of memory. 

Julian Barnes's Booker prize-winning The Sense of an Ending is about a retired man, Tony, who recalls his childhood friendships with schoolmates, chiefly the philosophical and introspective Adrian, and the course of a turbulent romantic relationship with an enigmatic upper class girl, Veronica. It is a reflection on how the consequences of past decisions and events would echo loudly and crashingly throughout the lives of those involved, as tantalisingly new perspectives of rooted personal histories are slowly unravelled. 

I practically inhaled this book in two sittings and am left craving much more. It's hard to believe that a 150-pager can pack so much of a punch and engender such an emotional investment in its protagonist - who is at once unreliable, unlikeable, and yet ultimately very relatable - without it ever feeling rushed or undeserving. 

An absolute must-read - 5/5",books,982

"I finished reading Reaper Man from Terry Pratchett, a few years ago I thought I would read some discworld novel but not all of them, I'm not so sure anymore. 

I don't know how he does it, his characters are both fun, exagerated, a caricature, lovely and finishing a story from him makes me sigh in some sort of melancholia every time. He uses often the trick to start with a little story unconnected to the main story and references it again at the very end, it works every time. Each character that grows makes me feel I'm growing with him, he can make a shopping mall into an eldritch abomination to make Lovecraft proud in a coming-of-age story about Death in a high-fantasy fun setting. 

And it works. Every. Bloody. Time.

Around 15 years ago I read a book (it had not just come out but I wanted to give some reference of the timeline) I don‚Äôt remember much about it.

"Although this wasn‚Äôt a book, it had a more moralising point than many books and left an incredible impression that deserves to be noted. I was watching an episode of CSI Las Vegas. 

They‚Äôve reached the conclusion that the following happened: a guy (the victim) had a encephalitis which caused fever and a huge headache, prompting him to start kicking the seat in front of him and to click time and time again the button to call the crew, irritating the passengers around him. He gets up and time and time again tries to enter the bathroom before returning to his seat, kicking even harder the seat in front of him, until the passenger in him front confronted him. A business man, already drunk, tries to calm down and fists the man, to which he responds by cutting the business man with a CD in the face. The victim finally gets up again and starts trying to open the cockpits door, trying to escape. He then approaches the airplanes door and tries to open the door. Five passengers get up and stop him, completely alarmed, eventually dragging him and starting to kick him, impulsed by adrenaline, eventually killing him. 

So, this was the conclusion they‚Äôve reached, but they didn‚Äôt have enough evidence and so the 5 killers end up going free. 

So, in the last few minutes of the episode, the investigators sit there, discussing whether they would be able to kill the victim or not.

Finally the chief arrives and the investigators ask him for his opinion, to which he says ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been all putting yourselves in the passengers shoes, departing from a single point of view. No one put themselves in the victims shoes, because when he was kicking the back of the seat and clicking the button, made you saw him as a beast, as an idiot. Because he tried to open the door, you saw him as a threat. This all happened because the passengers departed from a single point of view. It all happened because of their stereotypes. If a single one of them asked the victim how he felt, he would‚Äôve been saved. It took 5 people to kill him, but a single one could‚Äôve saved him‚Äù",books,2067
"So...I checked out a book on Libby. The, ""One Good Turn, return the book!"" Notification came on. So, I returned it right away without reading it. I then put a hold on it, so that way I can get it back without that message. The person ended up returning it right away. So I checked the book out. A few hours later, that message came on again. I returned it and placed a hold. Me and this other person went back and forth.

Well, I just found out from a librarian, that apparently they are only allowed a set number of checkouts on books before they have to pay again. On less popular books it is unlimited. So Libby is basically asking us to return the book, we return it without reading it to remove the message, and it is just one big back and forth deal. Libby needs to change the ""return book,"" message to ease any confusion. A lot of us, not just me, return the book and then put a hold on it since Libby says to.",books,917
"So my wife and I have a little competition every year to see who can read more books, and we use the Goodreads reading challenge as our score card. It's incredibly low stakes.

"Okay, so I was doing a reading test thing, and for context I usually don't read 'adult' books. I like young adult and stuff! But here's a paragraph that made me go, ""bruh""

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;From the corner of the divan of Persian saddle-bags on which he was lying, smoking, as was his custom, innumerable cigarettes, Lord Henry Wotton could just catch the gleam of the honey-sweet and honey-coloured blossoms of a laburnum, whose tremulous branches seemed hardly able to bear the burden of a beauty so flamelike as theirs; and now and then the fantastic shadows of birds in flight flitted across the long tussore-silk curtains that were stretched in front of the huge window, producing a kind of momentary Japanese effect, and making him think of those pallid, jade-faced painters of Tokyo who, through the medium of an art that is necessarily immobile, seek to convey the sense of swiftness and motion. The sullen murmur of the bees shouldering their way through the long unmown grass, or circling with monotonous insistence round the dusty gilt horns of the straggling woodbine, seemed to make the stillness more oppressive. The dim roar of London was like the bourdon note of a distant organ.

Like bro.

"I recently finished Ninth House and haven't been able to stop thinking about the novel. I'd love to hear what other people thought about the novel and what their overall feelings were. There will totally be spoilers below, so don't read on unless you've finished the book.   


Personally, I have to say I'm kind of torn about how to feel about it. While I enjoyed the book there were so many ways in which I thought it could have been better. I felt like it was a book that was on the cusp of being amazing, but it fell short of my expectations. I've tried to breakdown and organize my thoughts about different aspects of the book. Again, I'd love to hear how other people feel about it.  A lot of what I've heard about Ninth House has been nothing but positive, but I just don't know if it's as good as all that. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Characters‚ÄîOther than Darlington, I didn't feel particularly fond of any of the characters. Alex, Dawes, and Turner were decent but I never truly felt as if they were fully fleshed out. The room mates didn't necessarily detract from the story, but I'm not sure they really brought a lot to the story line either. I almost feel like it might have been better to cut the room mates and spend more time working with the central cast of characters to further develop them. 
2. Pacing‚ÄîEasily the biggest disappointment. The pacing felt like it was all over the place. It took a long time for the story to really begin, and the beginning of the book is structured very differently from the second half. We have these alternating chapters of Alex and Darlington from the past which slowly build the backstory of the characters. Once Bardugo runs out of backstory, she focuses only on the present which is a big shift in the pace she set at the beginning. I don't think the book necessarily progresses much faster after this point, but the characterization for me felt odd. It was almost like Bardugo piled on the backstory and front loaded it to get readers invested in the characters, then just focused on the plot towards the end. I would have much rather have preferred her try to work on interweaving the two while maintaining a consistent pace. 
3. World building/Setting‚ÄîThere is some great description in regards to Yale and the campus and New Haven. There are a lot of places where description is piled on and other places where it's spread a little thin, but I have to say I enjoyed places like Black Elm and Il Bastone. I also thought the premise of the Houses of the Veil was absolutely brilliant. The interweaving of magic into the fabric of the world we live in today felt very believable. To think that there is magic that is exploited by the very few elite, that our society as we know it is shaped so heavily by only a select few who have access to magic, was a tantalizing concept that drew me in from the moment I began reading. I love the whole idea of Lethe as the guardians between the Houses and the rest of the world, as a sort of entity that exists to police the powerful. Totally brilliant. By the end of the novel I felt slightly different about the world Bardugo had created. My biggest bone to pick is the uselessness of Lethe. I can't wrap my head around why Lethe exists when they are exposed to be essentially powerless at the end of the novel.
4. Themes‚ÄîThere were some great themes throughout this book, but I don't feel like Bardugo ever really dug in with a lot of them. She touched on a lot of things, but I can't say anything really left a lasting impression or reverberated with me. I'd love to hear about some themes you enjoyed. 
5. Plot‚ÄîWhat on earth was going on with this plot? Like the pacing, I felt like this was kind of all over the place. One of the best parts about reading books is trying to pick up the little clues here and there, and finally reaching the ending and realizing how all these clues have led to the climax. With this novel there was a climax followed by a brief resolution followed by a second and more significant climax that was just... Odd. When Alex does battle with Blake and Sandow, we are kind of led to believe things are all taken care of. Then Alex realizes who the real mastermind is and confronts him only to find out about Belbalm, who is just another character who up until this point I honestly could have lived without. There were no breadcrumbs leading up to Belbalm's big bad villain speech, no subtle hints at her true identity or intentions. This final confrontation is just one great long info dump. This was a colossal disappointment, as it's a twist that readers can not possiblly see coming. We just don't know enough about the world to have guessed at this ending, and it feels incredibly sloppy as opposed to clever or interesting.

"In my covid boredom, I have gone through a lot more shows, books, and games.

"I know Rand and her philosophy are controversial but I can't help but think it is a bit self-defeating - at least how it is presented in *Anthem*. Am I off base here? My thoughts below.

What incentive is there for Rand‚Äôs protagonist to desire the liberation of other men? If it is merely for the good of those men, then does this act of altruism not undermine her protagonist‚Äôs newfound philosophy of egoism?

But her supporters may object, ‚ÄúSuch an act is not real altruism, for it is conducted with the aim of increasing one‚Äôs own happiness. Thus, it is fundamentally egotistical.‚Äù If this false altruism brings about a greater sense of happiness for the protagonist, then does this not defeat Rand‚Äôs own word‚Äôs about using the individual as a means to an end?

&gt;‚ÄúI owe nothing to my brothers, nor do I gather debts from them. I ask none to live for me, nor do I live for any others. I covet no man‚Äôs soul, nor is my soul theirs to covet. I am neither foe nor friend to my brothers, but such as each of them shall deserve of me. And to earn my love, my brothers must do more than to have been born. I do not grant my love without reason, nor to any chance passer-by who may wish to claim it. I honor men with my love. But honor is a thing to be earned‚Äù (p. 96).

&gt;‚ÄúWhen I shall have read all the books and learned my new way, when my home will be ready and my earth tilled, I shall steal one day, for the last time, into the cursed City of my birth. I shall call to me my friend who has no name save International 4-8818, and all those like him, Fraternity 2-5503, who cries without reason, and Solidarity 9-6347 who calls for help in the night, and a few others. I shall call to me all the men and the women whose spirit has not been killed within them and who suffer under the yoke of their brothers. They will follow me and I shall lead them to my fortress. And here, in this uncharted wilderness, I and they, my chosen friends, my fellow-builders, shall write the first chapter in the new history of man‚Äù (p. 100-101).

&gt;‚ÄúI know not if this earth on which I stand is the core of the universe or if it is but a speck of dust lost in eternity. I know not and I care not. For I know what happiness is possible to me on earth. And my happiness needs no higher aim to vindicate it. My happiness is not the means to any end. It is the end. It is its own goal. It is its own purpose. Neither am I the means to any end others may wish to accomplish. I am not a tool for their use. I am not a servant of their needs. I am not a bandage for their wounds.

"Also posting this in r/history, incase thats more appropriate.

As stated I am interested in the greek creation myth, if one exists, and then of course the other popular myths such as the 12 labors of Hercules, Theseus, the voyage of the Argo (i have already read the Illiad and the Odessy), but alas I cannot seem to find anything short of text books that collect these stories and i was sort of hoping for the actual source material. Best I could find was Aesop's Fables and I fokt really think that's what I'm into based on reviews.

Does a Greek Prose Edda or Popol Vuh even exist? Thanks in advance!",books,1099

I am up late tonight wanting to read a new book and I was thinking back to a conversation my friend and I had about a possible future civil war in Britain.

Can anyone point me in the direction of any fiction out now that may already elude to or directly follow this?

Many thanks!",books,302
The title is just one of my favorite lines from White Noise by Don DeLillo. I just finished it. Never has a book made me truly think about my eventual death in such a way. This is an absurdly beautiful/robotically detailed story that I think I'm going to have to read a couple more times. I'll certainly never think about a supermarket the same way again. Sidenote: didn't know this book was where the airborne toxic event band got their name. Neat.,books,449
I signed up for my county's library system online yesterday and immediately went through their Kindle selections and cross-referenced to what I had on my Amazon wish list.

"When I was in high school (2010-2014) I read a really good book I can't remember, and google gives nothing useful. It's a dystopian sci-fi about a walled, class-based city. The main character is the son of a poor family, and in the story he gets really good at a popular starfighter/aerial combat game and eventually gets invited to a pro championship. It turns out to be a government experiment which leads to Hunger Games type anti-government conflict. Open to any possibilities.",books,481
"Elric of Melnibon√© was slated to get a television series a short while ago, but, due to perceived similarities to The Witcher, it was cancelled.
While the Witcher definitely contains homages to Elric, I'd hardly say that Elric and Geralt are terribly similar beyond appearances.
It really is a shame that the original White Wolf has been shafted so.
Poor Moorcock probably won't receive much mainstream recognition until after his death.
That's all ignoring how easily Elric and his sword, Stormbringer would work in a video game.
Making the protagonist exponentially more powerful in a fight with the more souls he claims would be a very exhilarating gameplay loop.",books,666

"...that I absolutely dislike Kip and ""The Mighty"". I am well aware that this might be an unpopular opinion since the books are highly popular, but seriously... Kip as a character feels so obnoxious and bland to me. He is portrayed like this cool, nerdy dude who constantly does the right thing by accident. The dialogs in the Kip-chapters are so annoyingly dumb that I want to skip them. They have nothing of the complexity of Andross Guile. And I know: he is supposed to be like this since he is... like what? 16? 17? But then I think of Teia or Liv and I like these characters.  


And dude, why on earth does Brent Weeks have to refer to Kip's penis as ""his horn""?  


Sorry, I just had to rant. If you have any insights on why Kip is actually a great character, I would like to hear them.",books,792
"Hi everyone. I hope these sorts of posts are allowed, because when you have just finished what you've realized to be your favorite series of all time, you want everyone to know about it. 

The Border Trilogy is made up of three novels: All the Pretty Horses, The Crossing, and Cities of the Plain. They take place in the 40s and 50s and are centered around two boys and their journey into manhood. The first novel, All the Pretty Horses, is about John Grady Cole, a 16-year-old free spirit who leaves his Texas home and travels down to Mexico to become a real life cowboy. He leaves with his friend Rawlins, with not much except their horses and their clothes on their backs. Along the way, they meet a 13-year-old boy named Blevins, a real pistol. Lots of Mexican liquor is drank and lots of funny dialogue ensues. 

The second book, The Crossing, is about a young man named Billy Parham, who lives on the Mexican border. He is trapping wolves with his father, since they have begun eating the cattle around the area. Well, he catches a wolf, a pregnant wolf. He falls in love with it, and takes it upon himself to release her into Mexico for a better life. The Crossing as just as much about Billy's crossing into manhood as it is about him crossing the border. It is devastating and some of the most beautiful writing I have ever read. 

In the third book, John and Billy have joined together to work at a cattle ranch, and have developed the deepest friendship you can imagine. 

These books are Western Gothic, though McCarthy's writing is so beautiful that we often get descriptions of men, horses, and wilderness that seem to be a homage to the Old West. To say his writing is difficult is an understatement. He is often compared to William Faulkner, and you will need Google translate for several of the passages written solely in Spanish. However, while McCarthy's writing may be described as ""pretentious"" by some of the harshest critics (several people say this with 1 star reviews on Goodreads), he is also deeply earthy, sensuous, and just plain beautiful. If you stick with these books, you will come across the most wondrous paragraphs you can find, that leave an imprint in your heart and a longing in your soul. Consider this paragraph from All the Pretty Horses: 

*That night he dreamt of horses in a field on a high plain where the spring rains had brought up the grass and the wildflowers out of the ground and the flowers ran all blue and yellow far as the eye could see and in the dream he was among the horses running and in the dream he himself could run with the horses and they coursed the young mares and fillies over the plain where their rich bay and their rich chestnut colors shone in the sun and the young colts ran with their dams and trampled down the flowers in a haze of pollen that hung in the sun like powdered gold and they ran he and the horses out along the high mesas where the ground resounded under their running hooves and they flowed and changed and ran and their manes and tails blew off of them like spume and there was nothing else at all in that high world and they moved all of them in a resonance that was like a music among them and they were none of them afraid neither horse nor colt nor mare and they ran in that resonance which is the world itself and which cannot be spoken but only praised.* 

I am not afraid to say that I cried at several parts of this book. And not just a tear or two either, but full blown crying sessions. This has never happened to me before. I cried for these characters like I cried for my old friends, because they became my old friends. 

These books are deeply beautiful and visually stunning. They're not just about the west either, if that's not your thing. They're about boys reaching manhood. They're about brotherhood and fellowship. They're about fathers and sons. They're about romance, and it is so shocking to me to find that the author of No Country for Old Men has written some of the most sensual love scenes I have ever read. 

Anyway, I digress. Perhaps re-read my post and play a drinking game. Take a drink of Mexican cider every time I use the word ""beautiful"" or ""stunning"" or ""deep."" But it really is that good, folks. And maybe this post won't really get a lot of notice. Maybe my swooning will annoy you. But if I can just get one person to read these books, I will consider my job done. There simply isn't another story like John's or Billy's in the world. 

Anyhow thank you for your time. I really appreciate it.",books,4524

"I used to feel bad before, when adults asked me what I read and I would call out names like Emily Bronte, R K Narayan, Roald Dahl, Enid Blyton and they would make a disappointed moue. Most of the times I shrugged this reaction off, contending that they didn't really know the worth of what they were dismissing. But the doubt grew in me. I asked myself several times, why fiction, what does it give me, where is the value added, questions that I would never have the answers too. Sometimes it was about escaping into another world but mostly it was about enjoyment. And I could never quantify my reading in terms of my growth as a human even though I knew with a certainty that it had been essential in moulding me. I slowly branched out into non-fiction, memoirs being the most preferred style. Today, while reading India A History by John Keay, it hit me. I realised that I would know how the people lived, the technical progression of Indian history, but I would never be able to feel what they felt, empathise with their hardships, learn from their mistakes. 

I'll not presume to speak for readers of fiction as a whole here, but at 25, after 22 years of constant reading I believe I have a fair idea of why fiction matters to me, why I would never again consider it a waste of time.

It awakens a rush of feeling in me incomparable to any of my other hobbies. When I see a character enchanted by humanity's knowledge, I think yes, I should learn more, when I read about nectarine, I automatically google it to understand what it is, when I am present in front of nature, only lines from literature can encapsulate how I feel. When I read On The Road by Jack Kerouac, I was inspired to take in more from life, when I read Wuthering Heights (my first favourite book) I fell in love with the moors, the winds, with difficult people whom in reality I give more chances than I should, when I read Tale of Two Cities or the Scarlet Pimpernel, I wanted to learn more about my own country, believe in it, when I read Time stops in Shamli by Ruskin Bond, I feel alive and am somehow transported back to drowsy afternoons in humid Chennai where life beats on in the face of mundanity. 

When I read about characters from a different background compared to me, I look at the people around me with the idea that I do not know their story. It is after all easy to say, ""place yourself in the other person's shoes"" but fiction gives me practice doing it. Enid Blyton's The Faraway Tree series had a character named Connie. I remember being annoyed by this character who wanted to dress daintily, not indulge in fun times, whined and cried about everything. But the story showed me how even such a spoiled kid could turn out be a good. Uncle Tom's Cabin horrified me when I read it at the age of 13. But it also taught me to treat everyone in a similar manner regardless of who they were, to give them a chance before allowing my prejudice regarding their caste, looks or background to dismiss them. Malgudi Days taught me to not dismiss people just because they weren't highly educated and so on and so forth.

Now, I'm not saying that all stories are moral stories. Of course they aren't. Stories are above all, for fun. But that is not all they are. They showed me that it was okay to be an atheist, okay to be different, okay to want peace and quiet, okay to be whoever you are. They showed me that there are greys everywhere, that sometimes what you think you want isn't what you necessarily want, that even if life isn't an adventure, you can make it that way. And most of all, I believe it gave me a way to understand people and the world we inhabit. And I cannot thank my mother enough, for introducing me to this world.",books,3719
"I was really eager to give WoT a chance but as i'm stuck  in the middle of the book 3 i don't think i'm coming back to it. Some of you might say that this book is just not for me. I disagree. I love certain elements implemented by RJ in his books that are often deal-breakers for others, as i know them and i adore them in other books. I love slow-pacing i love rich descriptions and i also really like the classic fantasy tropes (im a huge Tolkien fanboy). The problem with Wheel of Time is how these elements are executed. Slow pacing must be deserved. It only works when the core action is well thought out and characters are somewhat interesting. You cant make a slow paced book about a hamburger rotting on the side of the street because‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ it won't work. So what, that many people come around it everyday, and it is being showered by rains and lynched by malicious winds. I really don't care about it enough to spend my time to read about it.

This problem occurs many times across WoT.

Plot often times takes weird, and unintuitional turns, which also don't happen to have any real consequences, and when it finally gets somewhat captivating it gets brutally cut by some strange unexplainable deus ex-machina happenings which also don't have any reasonable consequences either.

Characters regarded as smart and powerful end up making the most stupid and ridiculous decisions. I may be cherry picking but im an experienced reader and i've learned to expect more from the books that want the reader to take them more seriously.

RJ is simply not a very good author. A good author before designing a plot point must think thoroughly what consequences will it have on the world and characters. RJ scarcely does that. He has an idea then implements it with little to no consideration. It not only ruins the plot, since most of what happenes  doesn't feel deserved nor earned, but also the characters regarded as smart, wise and percepive who get fooled in the most stupid of ways. It most importantly diminishes reader's trust in author's ability to produce good plot. And without that trust, well, further reading seems pointless.

A great example here is the Seanchan plot in book two. At first it seems really good. But after brief consideration you see how full of plot holes it is. Here is a short list of things that don't make sense in it:

\-Why does Nynaeve gets fooled by Liandrin so easily? She has absolutely no reason to trust her, especialy as Liandrin is a red Ajah (so it makes even less sense to trust her about Rand). Literally all Lianrin had to do was to tell them that Rand is in danger and that the Black Ajah are about (she doesn't have any evidence for either). Nynaeve doesn't show any active lack of trust towards her as they journey on, nor does she recognise her ridiculous mistakes later. I really have a hard time taking her seriously after that.

\-Both Egwene and Min hear Liandrin's dialogue with the Seanchan Noble which reveals a lot about her motifs and allegiances, yet in book 3 they just &gt;kinda forget about it&lt; and label Liadrin as a certain black Ajah. The overall fact that the girls got abducted by her to becme enslaved by the Seanchans is also ignored.

\-After Nynaeve and the girls get fooled by one Aes Sedai (Liandrin) that wants them to trust her they decide to follow another Aes Sedai (Verin) who wants them to trust her without even a hint of hesitation. I stopped believeing in existence of Nynaeve's brain at this point (and book 3 so far only confirms my unbelief).

\-After being replaced by Verin for entire book Moiraine just randomly shows up in Falme (without any hints that she was up to anything there previously).

\-The entire freakin' Seanchan invasion is completely forgotten with the end of the book 2. Neither of Aes Sedai mention it again in book 3 so far.

\-What RJ tried to achieve here was to put Egwene in danger so Rand has to face a difficult choice. It's a good idea but it's horribly executed.

And this is only one of the many moments where plot holes simply feel to large to ignore.

And this is why WoT's slow pace is what makes it such a chore to read. Why would I want to get engaged and immersed into the lives of it's characters when they simply put, don't feel real. Why would I want to take part in the lesser happenings when the larger ones are done so badly. Why would i want to read about an abandoned burger rotting on the side of the street.

This is what happens to characters of Egwene, Nynaeve, Moiraine and Lan. They are all interesting and well designed but then the former two get into this most stupid of plot-points, and the latter pair simply‚Ä¶ disapears or get replaced by an extremely boring counterpart (Verin is basicaly a dull and annoying version of Moriaine lol (seriously, she is given so much time in the book but presents little to nothing when it comes to character traits. The only thing that defines her is that she is an Aes Sedai lol!!)).

But plot need not to destroy some characters because they are already bad. Elayne for example was a very promising figure in the first book. But in the later ones she has literally nothing interesting about her besides the fact that she is an Andor heiress (but it really doesn't matter for most of the time too LOL!).

I'm not hating though. I love the world building done by RJ. I love how it strikes a great balance between the classic Tolkien'esque worlds and the modern realistic ones. RJ has many great ideas but he simply doesn't know how to put them together into a good plot.

I wanted to like this book series (heck i still do) but so far it reads like a book version of S8 of Game of Thrones.

Please tell me i'm wrong and why.",books,5708
"&gt; ""Another time Billy heard Rosewater say to a psychiatrist, ""I think you guys are going to have to come up with lot of wonderful new lies, or people just aren't going to want to go on living.""

Slaughterhouse-Five has undoubtedly been discussed to death already, but I just wanted to add my little note and a quote by Gene Wolfe. I find the sentiment that Rosewater echoes in the lines above interesting. One of the saddest sections in the book for me was Chapter One when the narrator who is Vonnegut himself where he is still struggling with what he witnessed in Dresden and so this book could be his way of trying to come to terms with it.

Much has been said about the philosophy of the tralfamadorians who see the past, present, and future but do not try to interfere. I do not think that Vonnegut really intended us to think that the guys who will have always blown up the universe were right though. If Vonnegut thought things could not change he would not write an anti-glacier book like this one or a cautionary tale about weapons of mass destruction book like Cat's Cradle.

Interestingly both Billy Pilgrim, drifting through time such as he is, and Rosewater, who claims to have known everything there is to know about life from the Brothers Karamazov before finding that that is not enough, have found some comfort in science-fiction. Kilgore Trout actually writes a story about a Christianity that would be kinder to bums with no connections which made me think of this quote by Gene Wolfe:

&gt; ""I would like [my readers] to better understand human beings and human life as a result of having read [my] stories. I'd like them to feel that this was an experience that made things better for them and an experience that gave them hope. I think that the kind of things that we talk about at this conference -- fantasy very much so, science fiction, and even horror -- the message that we're sending is the reverse of the message sent by what is called ""realistic fiction."" (I happen to think that realistic fiction is not, in fact, realistic, but that's a side issue.) And what we are saying is that it doesn't have to be like this: things can be different. Our society can be changed. Maybe it's worse, maybe it's better. Maybe it's a higher civilization, maybe it's a barbaric civilization. But it doesn't have to be the way it is now. Things can change. And we're also saying things can change for you in your life. Look at the difference between Severian the apprentice and Severian the Autarch [in The Book of the New Sun], for example. The difference beteween **Book of the Long Sun Spoiler** &gt;!Silk as an augur and Silk as calde [in The Book of the Long Sun].!&lt; You see?

&gt; We don't always have to be this. There can be something else. We can stop doing the thing that we're doing. Moms Mabley had a great line in some movie or other -- she said, ""You keep on doing what you been doing and you're gonna keep on gettin' what you been gettin'."" And we don't have to keep on doing what we've been doing. We can do something else if we don't like what we're gettin'. I think a lot of the purpose of fiction ought to be to tell people that.""

Rest in piece Kurt Vonnegut, rest in piece Gene Wolfe. So it goes.",books,3236

"I really enjoyed the book, but 

&gt;!What was the purpose of killing off the taipan and his mistress? First off he is the protagonist and it's bad form to kill the protagonist. Second he had some major character development during the book so the reader was emotionally invested, notably in his change of mind with his decision to marry his Chinese mistress. Third he was killed off in the last couple pages of the book. It seems the sole purpose of this senseless death was force a character change in the taipan's son so that he could rise and become taipan. I really didn't like this, so much so that I wish I just stopped reading at the last chapter!&lt;

"As title says, assuming a book with glued binding is done properly, how long should the binding last until it starts to break apart from the passive damage it gets from just being on a shelf (in a dry environment, not in direct sunlight etc.)?

Obviously I prefer to get books with sewn binding but for some books that isn't an option.

So in short, how long does glued binding lasts in general? Tried to find this information but the answers were rather all over the place so if anyone has any insight that'd be great!",books,519
"The title says it all. It takes me about 3 - 4 years to brainstorm/daydream/practice - write a novel idea before i put everything to paper, and 2 - 4 or even 5, or even almost a decade in some rare cases. I start writing in non - chronological order the scenes that inspire me the most way before I start putting everything together like a puzzle and writing the events of my story in the right order, and I write and re-write the same scenes and chapters with different details, dialogues, events or I add monologues or write them from different points of view. So for a novel idea to develop + be written in my head, it takes almost a decade.

To someone that might sound exhausting. But to me, each one of my characters is like my child, and I know them better than I know myself. I imagine their facial features, outits, voices, gestures, body language, accents, and different iconic behaviours of them, eg, the way they walk, the way they use their eyes to communicate, their smirks, everything. I know what they look like from head to toe, I know every detail of their chilhood, adoloscence and adulthood. I know their pet peeves, falws, quirks, passions, feelings, fears, insecurities and how they defated them, or how they defeated them. I never get the urge to drop a project once I start wanting to make it, the idea in fact of haing to drop one terrifies me. I will have to say goodbye to all the lovely children I have created. I will  have to say goodbye to the  little universe and world I have created. I imaagine each work that I write with a different color palette, and each character with their own unique color palette as well, every word i write has it's own color and my brain when I write something feels like a colorful aura/painting that depics the scene that I am writing. Changing one word, one phrase, one piece of doalogue, one detail in the character's outfit or body language can make me completely loose my inspiration.  Each one of my characters, even the side ones, who are not protagonists have a beautiful story to tell and they inspire me so damn much. I even have songs that inspire me to write and that remind me of them. I get the urge to talk about them so much, to a point where I have so many things to say that it gets tiring so I don't say anything other than their names. I even see them in my dreams or experience my dreams as them.

And they have their own personalities and behaviours, it is not like I make them do whatever I want. Their personalities, stories, and quirks just appear in my head, it is not like I create them. Or maybe I do but it is like... automatic. I sometimes think of my characters doing something silly, telling a funny line and I laugh or smile just by myself. Their personality just appears, it just pops up, their arcs just pop up in my head. I always imagined stories ever since I remember myself, as a form of escapism when I was very bored. I decided I should make it a form of art when I realized how nice it made me feel and how I needed to express it in paper to enjoy it as a creative activity. I am kind of afraid of the moments near the ending of a novel, because I will have to say goodbye to my children essentially. It is really a dream come true. 

And I  believe I am good at it. I love creating mystery, suspense, emotion, I love giving my readers hope and what the ancient greek lovers of tragedy and comedy would call ''katharsis'', I love writing the deepest of deep, the most human and real stories about being on the verge of hopelessness and yet recovring with the help of the realization that you have friends and people that love you and that with your bad life experiences you can help people going through similar things with you not make the same mistakes that you did. Even when I write something that is extreme high fantasy with imaginary worlds, creatures and powers I always make sure there is something real in what I write. Real stories are not stories that avoid escapism, fantasy and the imaginary, they are stories that despite being as imaginary and other-worldly as a story can be, they still reflect the real world, the real people living in it, and the real emotions they are experiencing. I went from writing wannabe-scary horror novels in script form with zero description (yes, I was that bad) to doing what I am doing today and I think I am doing it well. Or even when I am not doing it now, I know I have the potential to do it tomorrow. I am writing this out of joy, not pride. I am happy I can create a beautiful universe that my readers will enjoy, I am happy that I have a chance of writing something that could potentionally change somebody's life. 

When I told one of my classmates that I am a writer she asked me how do I not get bored. THIS is why I do not get bored, it is nice to have the chance to create your own world, to just imagine stuff. There is nothing boring with that, I am glad I have the chance to do something creative, life-changing and escapist that results in a product that makes people dream and fills them with ideas instead of sitting all day in front of a phone.

 And when I finish writing, especially when using a website like wattpad, someone gets to enjoy the fruit of my work. Someone gets to dream, wander and imagine the way I did. They get to feel emotions, pleasure, anger, sadness or joy. Just like i did. I feel lucky to be able to make readers feel this way.

And I will be honest, although I do not consider myself a classic or anything, despite being the grand-daughter to three greek classical authors, I like the idea of a child in literature class being forced by their teacher to read my stuff after I am long deceased. Not because I think I deserve it or anything, but the idea of my work being valued, loved, and dreamed about by others the way it was treated that way by me makes me wanna smile. 

So dear readers, book-nerds and book lovers: Thank you for loving our works the way we did. Thank you for making fandoms about them, thank you for buying pecial pretty editions of our books to keep them in your book collections, thank you for loving them that much. Thank you, a million times thank you. I hope that when I finish my current project(s) (I might be thirty when that time comes, and I am a bit scared of it coming to be honest cause I have never finished a novel before) you will love the fruit of my work the way I loved it. I am preparing something nice for the world (dare I say great, not out of pride, but out of joy, I put my everything in it)  and I can't wait till I hear what you guy have to say about them. I hope my writing will make you dream, think feel and come to conclusions. I want my work to make you happy. For once I want to feel like an artist, not like a nerd.  I believe if I was diagnosed with a chronic illness an had no time to finish my novels,I would type up some overviews of my stories, some of my favourite most impactful scenes and one last scene with me appearing in a room with all the haracters I have ever created telling each one of them seperately how much I love them and adore them and how they kept me happy and optimistic when things were rough. 

Anyway readers, thanks for doing what you're doing. Keep loving books the way we authors do. Hope you have an awesome day. Keep readng, it is like living a thousand meaningful impactful lives. I love you all so much.",books,7394

"I recently came across an article where George Orwell alleged that Brave New World was copied from a Russian novel 'We'. Intrigued by this accusation, I readily ordered the book and got down to reading it. The early pages did have a shade of Brave New World, however, as I progressed, it was altogether a different story! 

So many plotlines and concepts in 1984 have been lifted from We. A totalitarian world, a protagonist writing down criminal ramblings in a diary, falling in love with a revolutionary, and so on! I can go on and on about the similarities but I really want you all to read 'We'! It's a beautiful book that deserves more attention.

"So I've been reading since I was a child, I have always been into foreign Literature,mostly Russian and English. But in the past few months I have tried exploring Indian Literature, which is, surprise surprise, my home country and I was wondering if anyone here does read the same or has read.

I read Arundhati Roy's The god of small things and by far it became one of my favorite books ever. How she depicts the plight of casteism and patriarchy is so beautiful. The sad tone or like kinda feeling throughout the book directly hits you. You can feel anger boiling inside you when you reach the climax. It was really amazing.

Another I read was Godan (The gift of cow) by Munshi Premchand. He's one of the most reverred writers of Indian Hindi Literature. The book was funny and sad at the same time. It highlights the plight of farmers, the unjust system of taxes and casteism and plight of women in India. It's very provocative. Really bashes Men indirectly, some of the things highlighted are/were prevalent globally.

I read a few more but these two really stood out. If anyone here has any suggestion, I'd love to hear and check it out.

NOTE: Godan is in Hindi but it's available in english, I have the e-book for English version, if anyone wants to read, I'll mail it to you or you might try getting a hardcopy if you want on amazon :)",books,1344

I suppose it was more so that he behaved so maliciously to the women in the first place that made me feel as if he was being unreasonable.

"Most people seem to know Josh Malerman because of Bird Box, since it went big and became a Netflix movie. I see a ton of talk about it here and elsewhere, but there's little said about some of his other books. I'm curious to hear from people who've read them. Thoughts, opinions, etc.

One in particular is Inspection. I read it last year and loved it. It's a book that has really stuck with me, and something I find easy to recommend. I'm also surprised I don't hear about it much. Also, when I read The Institute later on, it reminded me so much of Malerman's book.

I'm looking into buying myself a copy of Inspection, because it's something I'd like to add to my collection and read again. Not that I don't already have way too many books.

Another is Unbury Carol, which I haven't read. I've had it out from the library forever (nobody else has requested it), but haven't gotten to it. It has a great premise, but other things have gotten in the way.

Last up is A House at the Bottom of a Lake, which also has an interesting premise that piqued my interest. Haven't been able to find it at any libraries though.

"So I'm reading **Rise to Rebellion** which is the first of a duology about The American Revolution. I've been fascinated with this time period and colonial America for years and read numerous books on the subject.

This is my first time reading anything from Shaara and as I'm making my way through the book there's something that's been increasingly bugging me. Does he always make his historical figures fit into nice little boxes? I understand that a lot of historical fiction takes liberties (no pun intended) on certain things, but his characterization of Benjamin Franklin and John Adams feels so off. 

Franklin in real life had a larger than life personality and was a known ladies man, yet in this book he comes across as an at times eccentric, intelligent old man that possesses pretty much none of the known wit the real Franklin had. That, and there's a scene where he acts like an awkward teenage boy  that's never encountered the opposite sex while playing chess with a woman. Really? The man had such a high libido that *it actually scared him.*

John Adams in real life was intelligent, but had a prickly personality. Of course the book mentions his relationship with Abigail so no problems there. However, his book counterpart is so laid back and agreeable that sometimes I think Shaara has him mixed up with someone else. 

I haven't gotten to any sections from Washington's view, but I'm assuming that he's going to be this aloof, almost godlike presence on earth that so many portrayals show. 

It's like Shaara is afraid to make the Founding Fathers human. He's pretty much stripped them down to caricature's of themselves. Oh, and any British character or Tory is confined to some sort of asshole.",books,1719

"I‚Äôm really into 60s music, like Bob Dylan and Neil Young, and my dad told me all these guys draw from ‚ÄúOn The Road‚Äù. I‚Äôve decided to pick it up from the library and I‚Äôm just now starting. What things should I know before reading it? Here are some questions:

Is it a true story or fiction, or is just some of it true?

Where did Kerouac‚Äôs writing career stand at the writing of ‚ÄúOn The Road‚Äù?

I know this was a 120 foot scroll or something like that. Where was he, what was he doing, and how long did it take him to write this?

What was the culture like in the US at the time?

What historical events shaped the events in the novel (please explain for me, I am very ignorant when it comes to history)?

How hard is the book to understand when it comes to vocabulary, figurative language, the moral (for me, a relatively smart student going into 10th grade)?

Thanks for any help!",books,881
This was a fascinating short read. One thing I liked about this book was how Crane seemed to make the Bowery come alive. Do you think the Bowery itself acts like a character in this novella? Personally I feel like jt would be an antagonist. The Bowery reminds me of where I‚Äôm from by the way so I think that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm so fascinated to it because I think I can relate with it,books,374

My OverDrive app is suddenly not working. Is it just me or is something wrong with the app right now?

I have 4 libraries in my OverDrive app and all have been working fine until a couple hours ago. I'm getting different sorts of messages depending on which library I try to access. One message says ""Network Connection Error. The request timed out."" Another says ""Site temporarily unavailable. Please try again later. We're sorry for the inconvenience.""  Other times I get a page that looks totally unfamiliar. It wants me to sign in to OverDrive and acts like I'm not already linked to my libraries (like it wants me to search for my libary as if I'm new and have never used the app before). I can't access any of my library accounts in the app.

"First off, let me say that I loved this book. I finished it last night after about 5 days and then put it down. I read Benjy's section twice, then Quentin's twice. Then I finished it fairly quickly after that. Without adding spoilers, Quentin's section hit me the hardest, but Benjy's was nearly just as powerful. I've never read a book like this. Granted, I started reading books for pleasure (for the first time in my life) in late May of this year and have only read 23 so far. Maybe I just don't have a lot of experience with this style (stream of consciousness). 

I went into it with only a little knowledge based on some reddit comments. I avoided CliffsNotes and just started reading. When I read through Benjy's chapter a couple of times, I thought I was getting the hang of it. When I got to Quentin's section, my head was spinning. But oddly enough, I didn't want to put it down. So I read that chapter again. This is a frustrating book, but I was willing to let myself get lost in it. More than once I started reading at 3 or 4 p.m., looked up and realized it was past midnight. I've never gotten that engrossed in a novel before. After I read through the whole thing, I put it down and have tried to move on to another book. But it feels like it's still sinking in, even when I'm not actively thinking about it. I don't know, maybe I'm weird. Has anyone else here been left with an indescribable feeling after finishing a book?",books,1440

"I am a huge thriller fan and someone recommended me James Patterson. I just finished Don't blink (also recommended to me) and honestly it was disappointing to me.

I saw that the book had 100 chapters and was shook because to many chapters sometimes can reflect a bad book.

Then I saw the chapters are freaking too short, what the hell was that! I read the book with 9 hours and I am literally sad because I took a break from thriller and this was my grand opening.

I didn't like it at all, the writing was too straight forward with hardly any build up and character description, it was bland.

"I read it cover to cover this morning. It was definitely engaging. Orwell was ""exposing the dangers of a totalitarian regime,"" and I suppose that it was more powerful in that effort by ending the story as hopelessly as he did. It's a shame, though, because being a child at heart, I was more interested in the world and characters he created than the lesson he was teaching.

Personally, I like happily ever afters, but I was expecting at least for Clover or Benjamin to use the final days of their life to sow the next revolution in the way that Old Major did. 

Also, I knew Napoleon was up to some shenanigans when he stole the puppies. Snowball was smarter than I am, based on how he spoke and his quick journey from illiteracy to designing a windmill generator. He would certainly have suspected something. 

If Napoleon's scheme was thwarted, the whole story would have been also. I'd enjoy a non-canon ""what-if"" version of the book where Snowball retains power and leads Animal Farm to greatness, inspiring a global animal rebellion.",books,1040

"I know the series was for children but I thoroughly enjoyed Harry Potter and am yet to find a set of books which have a whole load of elements come together in the final book in a really well thought out way. 

I am fed up with crime books where in the last five minutes everything all comes together in a way which you could never have guessed at during the main body of the text. 

I really like how, with Harry Potter, each book adds something to the plot of the next. It‚Äôs hard to describe but the characters seem very real, the horcrux story develops well and at the end, elements from every book are in play. 

I also liked the first two killing eve books for the way characters developed and I wasn‚Äôt sure who I wanted to triumph. The last book was pretty bad though.

"Hi everyone! I'm a teenager who just recently got into reading-for-fun over the summer because I had nothing else to do during quarantine. I'm still reading daily which has been nice. However, I tend to only read a little bit a day, probably about fifteen to thirty minutes at most. Reading for such a short amount of time each day works, especially if it's a good book, but it also causes a few problems, at least for me. It just mainly makes books feel a lot longer and slower than they actually are, and makes any book longer than like 170 pages feel like a huge commitment. I also hear about these people who can finish 300 page books in two days, and while I don't have enough time or willpower to get to that level, it would still be nice to be able to finish a 300 page book in a week or so, rather than a month or so. I think one of the factors causing me to read less is definitely the fact that I almost exclusively read in bed right before I'm about to go to sleep, which is nice and helps me fall asleep but only allows me to read for a short amount of time before I just get too tired and have to put the book down. I want to read during the day, but always end up procrastinating or getting distracted with other things. So, I was just wondering, what tips do you guys have for reading more?",books,1305

"Hey there book loving friends.


So with my friend I have this idea we developed, although I'm sure I haven't invented it, of reading a book together.

The rules are simple:

* we pick a book together
* we divide the chapters into measurable parts (eg. if the book has 15 chapters, we divide it into 5 big sections)
* each week we have a task to go over one section
* we talk at the end of the week to recap this week's section 

So far we covered several books (in the 8 to 10 range). The only personal drawback was that I didn't actively keep notes while reading, or while recapping with my friends.

What do you guys think of this idea? Do you have any suggestions for improvement?",books,684

"**Let me say up front, I know this is a rehash of old material, if not an actual repost.** I am posting it because it‚Äôs been a few years since it last came up, and it‚Äôs very much worth repeating, and also introducing to newcomers to Reddit or the subreddit.

Some years ago when I was new to Reddit, a post came up in this subreddit which attempted to tally up ‚ÄúReddit‚Äôs 200 Favorite Books.‚Äù Down the rabbit hole, I discovered that that (now lost to me) post was actually a repeat itself of an [earlier post](https://www.reddit.com/r/raerth/comments/cpxkq/reddits_favourite_books/) by /u/raerth. This topic has come up a few times since then, every few years, as (I think) well it should. From what I can tell, it‚Äôs been a few years since the last refresher--but more to the point it's been **ten years since the original post!** So, I thought it might be a good time to bring it to your attention. So, here we go!

The original list was compiled from various recommendation and ‚Äúbest books‚Äù threads now more than ten years old, which you will see if you click on the above link. There have of course continued to be new such posts in the interim, and so the list as I‚Äôm going to present it will have additional selections added to the end, based on some of the newer posts. You‚Äôll see if you look at the next two links that the original poster didn‚Äôt want the list tampered with; out of respect for that, I‚Äôll put a divider between the original 200 and the later additions. What I have NOT done is recompiled old and new posts together to produce an updated ranking; I just tacked new selections on at the end without ranking them into the original list. You should also know that the list is also available on Goodreads in two parts, [here (part one)](https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/78785.Reddit_Top_200_Books_list_1) and [here (part two)](https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/78786.Reddit_Top_200_Books_list_2). 

Feel free to discuss anything you like about them‚Äîyour experiences with these books, what you think belongs here and what doesn‚Äôt, etc. In the intervening years, has anyone read through the list, whether partially or completely? How did that work out?

I want to point out that clearly a few entries were given as joke entries on the posts from which the list was originally sourced, but with enough frequency that they were preserved here anyway; no need to point out that those selections aren‚Äôt serious. Also, a few entries made it on as a series, not an individual book, so the total number of books here is higher than expected. 

**I know this list is heavily white male authors.** Feel free to discuss that too, but remember that that‚Äôs more a reflection on the state of publishing over the years than a reflection on any Redditor.

The remainder of the list was added by me in 2016, mostly for my own use, but I‚Äôve decided to include it here. I compiled it from several newer posts, as the original list is now ten years old. I do not, unfortunately, have links to those posts on hand. I also haven‚Äôt been as rigorous about it as /u/raerth was for the original list; these items aren‚Äôt ranked, and haven‚Äôt been placed among the original list entries. I simply pulled those popular books that hadn‚Äôt already been included in the original list, and tacked them on in no particular order. So, feel free to take or leave them as you see fit.

"Don't get me wrong, I *love* to read books. But somehow I love buying books even more. It's just the feeling of knowing that there's a fresh, untouched, new journey right in your closet waiting to be embarked on, that's what gives me a high. You know what I mean?

I have read like 20% of all the books that I own. It's becoming a problem and I don't know how to stop. 

Maybe I'm just addicted to shopping? 

What do you do when you know you have about 239 new books waiting to be read but you can't stop yourself from buying even more books to add to that collection?",books,569
"Got through about 300 pages of Justin Cronin's The Passage before I had to put it away. It was a christmas present from my dad. We share a similar taste and he really liked this one, but it was such a dud for me.

Do any of you ever feel compelled to finish books you were gifted (or just in general)? Why or why not?",books,317
"Really curious on everyone's thoughts on the book which came out just over a year ago and is now being made into a short tv series! Wondering whose story really stuck with them the most?

I'd have to say mine was Maggie Wilkens experience, interestingly her name wasn't changed and you can even research her story online.

I felt a lot of rage reading her experience because the people who were supposed to protect her didn't throughout her life. Made me realise how much prosecuting rapists and paedophiles is so difficult for women in court, and they have to go through the whole experience again as well as being accused of lying.  

Something which really stuck with me, was Lisa Taddeo mentioned when discussing her book,  while writing it, she realised how much women bring other women down, do you all agree? I feel women sometimes internalise a lot of misogyny and  it comes out when we judge other women (For example with Sloane who was judged for her sexual desire)

The book has also made me realise how much we discuss what we don't want, but never what women do want. There were elements of this in the book with the women often being on the receiving end of the desire of men and what they want. 

That's not to say these women weren't powerful, for example, it was very powerful for Maggie to come forward with her experience when she was older. In general, society is a lot more equal and less patriarchal than it was, not to say we're at all close to equal. 

Lastly, what touched me most about the book, was these normal women's stories could be considered extreme, however their emotions and feelings are relatable to everyone.",books,1646
I was surprised to learn that some people don‚Äôt see movies in their mind as they read a book. Sometimes I have a very specific vision of a character in mind and then the author includes a physical description or detail about the character which will throw me off. I had one book that I enjoyed except for the fact I couldn‚Äôt accurately picture one of the main characters as described by the author. This is likely also why movie/tv adaptations of books can be iffy - it doesn‚Äôt match up in my head. Just curious if others have this experience.,books,543
"Hey all. I faintly remember a book that my teacher read to us in second grade. I have no clue what it‚Äôs called and that‚Äôs why i‚Äôm here. I remember it was about a principal in school who decided there would be school every day. Saturdays, Sundays, holidays, all. I remember the main girl and her brother would play on the swing set on the weekends, and eventually the school days go back to normal. My teacher joked that if our principal came in we‚Äôd hide the book so we didn‚Äôt get the same idea. Does anyone have an idea of what this book is called?",books,549
"Has anyone read this book? 

I love Murakami's books normally but I was a little unconvinced by this one. I felt it ended with a lot of unanswered questions and felt pretty unsatisfying.

"I have been looking for hardcover versions of one of my favorite series, Hyperion by Dan Simmons.  I can‚Äôt figure out why, but the hardcover versions of all but the last book are prohibitively expensive.

"Hello! I just received has a gift the book Dune by Frank Herbert and was very excited. Although I‚Äôm enjoying reading its all a bit confusing (I‚Äôm in the first 100 pages still).

"I am currently trying to find an essay/documentary/website that has good quality information on the origins, context and ideas behind 'Brave New World', without the comparisons to '1984' that I have found many essays on the book contain.

"Is it hard to read John Le Carre's books? Since a friend recommend me to read it. I've read a review that the ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"", a &lt;250 page book, by Le Carre was dull and unimaginative. 

TL;DR Could an average reader, who have read at least 25 English books (e.g. nancy drew, 1984), read the writings of John Le Carre?",books,333
I enjoyed it well enough but if the rest of the series is like the first I'm not sure I want to continue. This book has some fantastic ideas and the world being built is intriguing. Getting a vignette as spans of time were skipped felt more like a skeleton and I want a bit more meat on those bones. Does the rest of the series follow this format?,books,347
"Hello everyone. I‚Äôm re-reading 100 Years and a particular quote struck me as being able to capture what I‚Äôve been feeling ever since the pandemic hit. It has now been 6 months of staying in, cancelled plans, in and avoiding people as much as possible. For me, the description of the rain really resonated with the current circumstances and just wanted to share to see if anyone else feels similar. 

There is a chapter in the book where it rains ‚Äúfor four years, eleven months, and 2 days. There were periods of drizzle during which everyone put on his full dress and a convalescent look to celebrate the clearing, but people soon grew accustomed to interpret the pauses as a sign of redoubled rain.‚Äù

‚ÄúAureliano Segundo returned home with his trunks, convinced that not only √örsula but all inhabitants of Macondo were waiting for it to clear in order to die. He had seen them as he passed by, sitting in their parlors with unabsorbed look and folded arms, feeling unbroken time pass, relentless time, because it was useless to divide it into months and years, and the days into hours, when one could do nothing but contemplate the rain.‚Äù",books,1138

"It's week 1 of classes where I live, and I've already had some of my students (13-16yos) beg me to not give them too many books to read while others were pleading for more (difficult) books. They have to read at least 4 books and they have some choice, but most of it has been decided for them, unfortunately.

I'm a huge book nerd and will discuss everything passionately, but I'm looking for ways to spark their own little flame as well...in a lesson of 50min where I also need to cover other elements.
Do you have any tips?",books,526
"I recently read Normal People by Sally Rooney and I loved it. Is Conversations with Friends worth reading as well? The plot seems notably different. All I've read about it was the first little excerpt in my copy of Normal People and while it seemed interesting, I'm not sure it's my cup of tea.

I'd love your insight and opinions!",books,331
"Hello, I would like to ask about a problem (or weird thing anyway) that a paperback book that I recently bought does. 
So, first of all, if I don't move or bend the pages in any way, or let the book stand on its spine, the pages don't move, it's like they are fixed into place. When I turn the book while reading it, the pages make a weird ""crack-crack"" sound, and I can see that they seem to be wavy in the inside part of the book, where they all start to meet each other. 
If I even open the book at 180¬∞ degrees or more, the pages don't fall on the side, they just form a weird shape like an accordion...
Does this situation depend on the type of binding? I can see that the pages are glued on the spine...or maybe is it a humidity problem or something?
If there is a solution to that please let me know, because I can't find anything else online.
Thank you",books,860
"I'm curious if people's reading habits have altered during the lockdown/quarantine. Obviously some aspects of the entertainment industry, like streaming, have seen a boost in viewership this year; while others, like movie theaters, have been adversely affected. What about books? Have you been buying more or less books since this all started?  


For me personally, I've been buying way more books than usual (and I was already buying an above average amount of books pre-COVID).",books,480

"I like reading but I have to read a book called ‚Äòthe old school‚Äô for my uni course. My god I hate it. It‚Äôs detective fiction and I find that genre so uninteresting. I was honestly just going to go with what I‚Äôve read already for the essay (p128 out of 362) but I just found out the essay is on the END of the novel. Believe me I‚Äôve tried to force myself to finish it, its been two weeks (we were meant to finish it last week).

It is a very popular opinion that one can articulate well only if one reads a lot of books. I do read books but very rarely.

"I think it's conducive to most mystery stories, while reading them you tend to put on your Sherlock Holmes persona and try to pick up the clues as you go along and see if you can figure out how things are going to end. That's why some of the best mysteries have clues sprinkled in so you have a fair chance to solve the case and some of the worst are the ones that pull some character or detail out at the last moment that made it nigh impossible to figure things out. 

Lately I've been trying to just enjoy the stories on their own merits. I'm reading the Brother Cadfael books by Ellis Peters and I love the writing style so much I find myself getting lost in the overall world that I almost forget I'm reading a mystery, lol. I guess like most any book, it boils down to how good the writing is.",books,799

I have noticed that just like 2 years ago I was able to sit and read for 2-3 hours without amy difficulty but now,especially in this quarantine, even 30-40 minutes of uninterrupted reading becomes impossible sometimes.

"Hello. I found a Movie called ""The Platform"" and its a great plot twist kind of movie, would anyone be able to give me a genre of books that would suit similar to The Platform.

If you don't have time to watch a review etc, basically its a movie about a tower with a hole in the middle. Each level has 2 people and you switch levels at random amount, up or down each month... the bigger the number, the lower you are. In the middle is a hole and a platform goes down it where people try and eat as much food possible... by level 50 all the food is gone.

"I haven‚Äôt read for pleasure since my last year in college because I was so busy. During this quarantine I finally made time to read and here are the books I have read so far.

1. The Brothers Karamazov by Fyodor Dostoyevsky- Absolutely loved it. It is now my favorite book. I love the interesting characters and the philosophical discussions. The chapter called The Grand Inquisitor blew my mind. Dostoyevsky is a genius writer.

2. The Little Prince- This book made me cry. Like a lot. It‚Äôs perfect for adults. A gem hidden in pages indeed.

3. All the Light We Cannot See by Anthony Doerr- Despite the long descriptions, I didn‚Äôt find it difficult to read. I enjoyed the anticipation and it kept me at the edge of my seat. There were no chapters that made me want to skip. 

4. The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern- I didn‚Äôt like it as much unfortunately. The prose is beautiful and the descriptions appeal heavily to my senses. But I wish it was more character driven. A lot of readers love this book but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs for me.

5. The Return of The Young Prince by AG Roemmers- It was more like a bunch of essays hiding behind a famous story. I didn‚Äôt like it but the author had some good points. I guess I had high expectations since I really love The Little Prince. Unfortunately, this pales a lot in comparison.

6. Little Women by LM Alcott- Charming book. I enjoyed it but as most classics goes, there were chapters that I really wanted to skip. But I love the characters and the simplicity of the story.

7. The Kingdom of Back by Marie Lu- It was okay. Perhaps magic doesn‚Äôt appeal much to me. Like the Night Circus, I wish I could love it more.

"Welcome to our weekly recommendation thread!  A few years ago now the mod team decided to condense the many ""suggest some books"" threads into one big mega-thread, in order to consolidate the subreddit and diversify the front page a little.  Since then, we have removed suggestion threads and directed their posters to this thread instead.  This tradition continues, so let's jump right in!

 **The Rules**

 * Every comment in reply to this self-post must be a request for suggestions.

 **How to get the best recommendations**

 The most successful recommendation requests include a description of the kind of book being sought.  This might be a particular kind of protagonist, setting, plot, atmosphere, theme, or subject matter.  You may be looking for something similar to another book (or film, TV show, game, etc), and examples are great!  Just be sure to explain *what* you liked about them too.  Other helpful things to think about are genre, length and reading level.

 All Weekly Recommendation Threads are linked below the header throughout the week to guarantee that this thread remains active day-to-day.  For those bursting with books that you are hungry to suggest, the suggested sort is new; you may need to do this manually if your app or settings means this does not happen for you.

"For the second time I‚Äôve finished reading The Fountainhead, 20 years between, and again I found the characters absolutely compelling, loved or hated.  The novel screams about the spirit of the individual and continues to be revelatory to me nearly a century after its setting.  In our current environment of social media collectivism celebrating mediocrity it feels like this novel is even more important.  Roark as the antihero, I don‚Äôt imagine he would have much of an Instagram following.

Why do people love to hate this novel and Rand?  Who are some modern antiheros?",books,572
I‚Äôd like to know the word counts of various books since page length isn‚Äôt a good metric of comparing how long books are.

"So I've been having this problem for a while now. You know, I start reading a book, read for a bit and then realize what I'm looking after isn't enjoying its content fully - but rather completing the chapter and feeling a sense of achievement about it. Like, I'm trying to get to the point where I've finished the book so I can be proud of myself for having read it and jump to the next one. This also causes me to count how many pages I have left from the current chapter so it can be clear in my head how much I have to complete before I take a break or reset mentally about the next one. Honestly, this doesnt happen only with books,  but also with movies and series, where I constantly glance over the time left for the episode or the movie, so I can know I've finished it. I honestly have no idea how to resolve this, because I want to actually enjoy my time reading instead of my time having read the thing. I was hoping I could get an advice or two, hoping it wouldnt be to just stop reading, lmao.",books,1005
"Alright people, I want some opinions about ""A Little Life"", written by Hanya Yanagihara.

I thought it was really well written, great prose and some really good ideas on friendship, sacrifice, commitment and the hardness of dealing with trauma.

I also thought though that the plot has serious problems. There are several unrealistic factors that just don't work. Some are even ridiculous, like how randomly Dr  Taylor finds Jude and all the drama that comes from it. It does seem to much how Jude just managed to come across in 15 years with all the possible abusers and still be able to become an amazing mathematician, cooker, pianist.

Anyway, just wanted to know some opinions as in Goodreads I found far to many 5 stars for this book and it seems to me quite overrated

"The last few months, I've been depressed and lost. I was unemployed because of the pandemic and I love my job. I was trying to fill the void with video games and TV and movies but nothing helped. Until I picked up some of my old high school collection. I started with *Columbine* by Dave Cullen and remembered my amazing AP Lit teacher that crafted special projects for me because I hardly engaged with the regular curriculum. Next, I read *In Cold Blood* by Truman Capote and remembered my awesome Trig teacher  who was a huge conspiracy nut and film fanatic, both influenced me on my ultimate career journey as a screenwriter and filmmaker (focusing on secret history and unknown culture). And currently, I'm reading *Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World* by Jack Weatherford and I'm remembering how all the people in my life helped me grow to who I am and allowed me to craft my own interests and hobbies, my own thoughts and beliefs, and my own dreams and goals.",books,977

"I'll start by saying I would only recommend this novel to someone interested in the history of English literature. The language is a bit archaic (with a good bit of Latin) and the text assumes the reader has a solid knowledge of pop culture of the time. The author begins each book (sections divided into chapters) addressing the reader directly and typically explains his opinions on the proceeding book and how critics and readers alike will take it. In a way, it tells rather than shows. He does admit that at times his writing can be somnambulant, which is bold to say the least. Tom Jones is an interesting character, very likeable, but pretty much everyone else is one dimensional. The plot, 2 lovers trying to get married against their parents' wishes, is entertaining and well executed. There are also occasions which are laugh out loud funny, which I appreciate. #bookreview #simplebookreview",books,901

"Hi! I have been looking for this book for years and have googled it many times with no luck. I'm hoping this might ring a bell for one of you well-read internet friends
I read this in the early 90's. It was a large hardcover book, with a picture of a ship sailing away in blue water on the back cover. I don't remember the front cover. I think the author was a man.
The main character is a young man with dark curly hair. His name may have begun with the letter G? There are elemental spirits in the book and they are often kept in bottles, they are called djinn. They can be used to make the wind blow or make lightening. They could speak and were funny at times. Kind of like elemental pokemon. At one point the main character gets captured and is made a servant at a woman's house in a foreign city. He has to wear pink clothes and they oil his hair. He finds some bottles with elementals and uses one to make a ship fly.
That's all I have. If this sounds familiar to anyone please let me know, I liked the book a lot as a teenager and would love to read it again.",books,1067
" 

of course this question is always subjective, but i feel like if you did a consensus among comic book fans on this question, the majority would go to Alan Moore, regardless of what you think of his work. The man redefined comics, and i think this is the only medium of fiction where there is really a defined GOAT.

 when was this status solidified was it really after Swamp Thing and Watchmen which were two groundbreaking comics... everything else after that was cherry on top, or if it was mediocre it had no effect on his legacy

or did it take longer, in the 90s with more work that he was eventually solidified with the moniker as the greatest comic writer of all time?",books,678
"When I was a teenager I had a self proclaimed rule that I was not to watch any movie before I read the book. So in order to watch my sisters favorite movie, Forrest Gump, I read the book. 

*Incoming Spoilers*

And ever since I have gone on an absolute rampage at anyone who calls Jenny a whore. 
The book and the movie are completely different stories, aside from the names and a few war stories, they are NOTHING alike. In the book, my favorite part is when Forrest gets sent to space with an ape and a female astronaut and they crash land on a pigmey cannibal island.  
My other favorite bit of this BOOK, is that Jenny, is absolutely NOT a whore! After Forrest comes back from war, he, Lieutenant Dan, and Jenny, all get an apartment together. They live there fairly happily. Jenny and Forrest are in a completely committed normal relationship. Until Forrest ends up getting a job as a showboating wrestler whose stage identity is absolutely degrading to himself. Jenny begs him not to do this job. She would rather be poor and happy with him with his dignity, because that‚Äôs how fracking loyal she is, than see him be ridiculed every night for a few hundred bucks. She begs him night after night not to go to this job, but Forrest continuously refuses Jenny‚Äôs request. He totally blows her off, and even puts her down. He‚Äôs actually a total dick in this chapter. So Jenny leaves him. They were together for 6 years before this happened. 
Jenny is a loyal woman who did what any woman would do in that situation. The damn movie sucks ass, and portrays Forrest as a completely naive and innocent idiot where in the book he is far more human. In the book everyone seems so much more real, with complex ups and downs, character flaws development, and more realistic responses to more outlandish situations. It‚Äôs an all around fantastic read and anyone who ‚Äúloves‚Äù the movie is living a lie.

"I'm no antiquarian, but I do really like the [Penguin Classics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penguin_Classics) ""black cover"" books (the ones with the white stripe running from front to back through the spine).  Before COVID, I would buy these books by going to used bookstores in-person.  Now, I'm buying my used books online through alibris or thriftbooks.  Unfortunately, Penguin Classics reuse ISBN numbers between the black cover design and the older yellow cover design (which are unsightly).  

Has anyone found a strategy that ensures they get the right cover version?  Normally, the price of the black covers are a bit higher, but it's no guarantee as different booksellers can list very different prices even of the same cover.  I've been mostly lucky so far, but I just got a yellow cover of the Norman Denny translation of Les Mis when I was really hoping for the black.

PS Returning is not really an option (or even worth the bother in most cases) as online booksellers only guarantee at ISBN level and use stock covers in their catalogs.

PPS Sorry, don't know if this is the right sub to post my question to.  Let me know if there is a better one.  As I said, I'm not a book collector in the sense of hunting rare books; I just really like the black cover Penguin Classics as they are the apotheosis of tidy elegance.",books,1333

"Edmond Dantes was wrongfully imprisoned for 14 years(?). He faced despair and insanity before meeting the beloved Abbe. Edmond developed the knowledge and resolve to get his revenge on the ones who imprisoned him. Edmond then went on to successfully complete his revenge after years of planning, and lived the rest of his life in peace. Along the way, Edmond received immeasurable wealth, influence over bandits, the Pasha, and other powerful figures.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I have been wrongfully imprisoned for about 6 months. I have been forced to work from home. I have to wake up at a reasonable time in my own bed, turn on a computer, and complete simple tasks at my leisure. I have to eat warm food, drink cold running water, and enjoy the views of the outside world from the comfort of my home. Limited social interaction and an overindulgence of tv and movies have me facing my own despair and insanity. Along the way, I have gained close to 20lbs of fat, grown a horrific beard, and developed a paranoia about people coughing. ^(maybe some sarcasm)

"I just wanted to write a brief summary of my expectation and experience reading Down and out in Paris and London by George Orwell. Prior to this I had only read some of his fiction: 1984 and Animal Farm, which I enjoyed, so did not know what to expect from memoirs of his. I was looking forward to hearing about London more than Paris, however I enjoyed reading the Paris chapters more than his return to England.

Being English, and having ""struggled"" with work in my early adulthood as well as working essentially as a ""plongeur"" like Orwell did, the sections where he described life and the lack of a social life while working as a plongeur are fantastic. These observations and memoirs are from a man's experiences nearly 100 years ago, but still resonate. The people he describes and the fatigue he felt still exist today.

But still, the book never feels like a sorry read.

Although it highlights the true struggles that thousands of people faced every day: the long, long hours, and the laborious and monotonous herding of homeless men and women in harsh pre-WWII London, there are characters and observations that maintain a wholesome, positive spirit. It's that war-time feeling of gumption and positivity through hardship that makes the book and characters within feel so relatable and interesting nearly 90 years on.

I'd recommend this book keenly to anyone with an interest in nonfiction or memoirs. Definitely worth a read if you've ever worked as a waiter/ waitress or a porter in a busy restaurant or bar too!

"If you don't know, the Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes is a new book by Hunger Games author Suzanne Collins, and is a prequel to the series set about sixty years before the events of the trilogy, during the Tenth (?) Hunger Games. Of course, when I heard about this, I was pretty intrigued; Hunger Games was one of my favorite series when I read it in middle school, and although the premise of the prequel didn't seem super exciting (basically an origin story of President Snow, the villain of the originals), I was still down to see what Collins would do with the world.

When I finished it a few weeks ago though, I was left feeling profound....confusion. It's really hard to know what to make of this book because it's just so strange. It's not terrible, but I wouldn't say it's very good either, and it's definitely a disappointment (turns out, Collins is not as good of writer as my middle school mind thought she was). But, there are still some interesting ideas here. Let me explain:

* So the main character is Coriolanus Snow, an 18 year old student at the Capitol's elite high school. If you were expecting an origin story to a villain, well, this isn't really that. Coriolanus is actually surprisingly....normal. His characterization is one thing I liked about the book; he is likable, but you still do gets hints of how he could potentially turn villainous. He's a bit fake, obsessed with keeping up appearances (especially since his family, the once-rich Snows, have fallen onto very hard times; Coriolanus's poverty despite technically living in a penthouse is a major theme of the book), and he has an almost fanatic belief that order and stability are necessary for a good society. I think you can see where that can lead....
* Now, on to the plot: there isn't really one. I jest, I jest, but seriously, the plot is completely bizarre. It's very aimless and unsure of what it's trying to tell. So Coriolanus becomes a mentor to a participant in the Hunger Games, and about two-thirds of the book is sort of about these early Games. but since we're not actually following someone in the Hunger Games and we're  following Coriolanus who's only watching the Games, it's not as exciting as when we have Katniss's POV in the originals. Then the last third of the book takes place in District 12, and this is where it gets super weird. The climax is not really a climax at all, and was so confusing I didn't really understand what had just happened.  Then it just kinda....ends, with Coriolanus sorta becoming villainous but not really. 
* Basically, this book is just an excuse for Collins to talk about philosophy, specifically the state of nature (the pretentious epitaphs from people like Locke and Rousseau clues you in on that). There's a lot of stuff about the social contract and how that applies to the Capitol and the Districts, whether the Hunger Games are truly necessary to keep the districts in line and what not. This stuff is interesting, but since, again, Collins isn't that great of a writer, it's all a bit surface-level. 

If you were hoping for some big reveals about Hunger Games lore, well this book doesn't really have that. There is some interesting stuff, like how the Capitol is really scarred by war even a decade later, or how they're trying to figure out how to make the Hunger Games more interesting and ""interactive"" to audiences because a lot of Capitol folk, surprisingly, find it barbaric and unappealing. But yeah, this isn't really a Snow origin story either. It's just....something. Something weird.",books,3547
"Doing some research and I was hoping to gather a list of shared universe series to analyze.

Things along the lines of Asimov, King, Lovecraft. I'm still not sure on how I'd characterize different styles of shared universes. For example, it's not always entirely clear from any two given King books or Asimov stories that they are in the same universe, but it is very clear that any two Star Wars books are in the same universe. Maybe it comes down to the subtlety of the connections. If anyone is aware of a discussion on this topic, I would also love being pointed in that direction.

* What do you think Purity Cartone by this? What do you think happened to him?

* What do you think happened to Muire Lo? Do you think Baru asking for him to be brought to her was a mistake?

* Is Baru still making the same mistakes as earlier in the book (not considering that the other people are also players that make their own decisions) or is she making new ones?

"I've been reading a ton for the past year. 

And I've been having trouble with some fictional monsters. There's a really fine line authors walk when portraying a monster, a balance between being mythically threatening, and actually presently dangerous. 

Here's a few examples:

*Dracula- Everyone in Transylvania knows this vampire as an all powerful despot. He possesses many otherworldly demonic powers, but once he is out of Transylvania, he is entirely out of his element, and is reduced to minor acts of aggression targeting few people in an effort to establish a hive.*

*Moby Dick- Across the 7 seas, many have heard tales of the white whale riddled with old harpoons. He leaves a trail of destruction everywhere he goes, Sailors fear crossing his path, and his existence has been compared to a biblical catastrophe.*

*Pennywise(from IT)- The small town of Derry lives in cattle-like ignorance of their eldritch oppressor.

"Hi all,

Hoping this post will find some legs here. As a typical American, under-educated in American politics, I‚Äôm hoping r/books can help come up with a short list of books that provide a succinct overview of the American Political system. I‚Äôm looking to learn more about the structure of the system and how it works, rather than about specific policies and measures. Examples of what I‚Äôm after:

- Responsibilities and structure of the House &amp; Senate

- Elections (Primaries, Special, General, etc.)

- How are bills, amendments and laws written, voted upon and passed

Thanks, and I hope this will be beneficial to others than myself!",books,642
"And I'm more amused than anything right now.

Before I got the book, someone had hinted that it's a romance novel. Cool, right down my alley.

Now that I've picked it up, I've officially Googled the book (something I try not to do to avoid spoilers or any biases - like this book sucks or is this really a tale of freedom - you know the articles). During my search, I found that there seems to be a divide on the actual genre but overall the consensus seems to be that it is a gothic novel with romantic inclinations.

However, even with that in mind, it's just an amusing (near comedic) book to me. There are scenes where I'm like ""oof, that's tough"" but overall the characters seem to have asshole tendencies (which can be amusing) and are more like broody teenagers or grumpy old men than anything (except Mr. Lockwood, who is a bean). I'm wondering if my view will change the more I read. 

Any thoughts? Any books you've read that didn't seem to get their desired genre across to you?",books,989

Strumpet City is a book that has stuck with me. I‚Äôm not sure how frequently it‚Äôs read outside of Ireland, and I wish that wasn‚Äôt the case. The 1913 lockout is so well described, it‚Äôs as if the author was actually there. 

I loved how well the author portrayed the different classes. It was done without judgment and really I felt as if I was in their homes with them and living their struggles with the author‚Äôs descriptions. 

Did anybody else have a visceral reaction to this novel? Did it live in your head for days after as you went back and re-read bits and pieces? For me, this is a novel I can go back to and re-read and pick up something new each time. I appreciate anybody else‚Äôs reactions and thoughts!

"So this was a book I'd been meaning to get to for a long while. My wife bought me an Audible subscription (I know it's not reading but it's still a book) and it seemed like a good one to take a punt on, especially seeing as I'd recently been indulging in plenty of my other favourite genre - fantasy.

I've got some questions, I can't seem to even see discussed online. I was hoping I could discuss some of these with those of you that have read it. These questions will contain spoilers so please don't let them ruin what I consider to be a great book if you haven't already read it. I wish I could've picked Mr Banks' brain himself.

1. Horza has a flashback in roughly the middle of the book where its like he's been woken out of the matrix. He's talking to Xoxarle who mistakenly uses a subtly different name for Horza's old lover. There's some more suggestion around the fact that Horza is one-of-many in some sort of maybe clone program/parallel universe/computer simulation. It also seems like his one-last-job assertion is an issue the Idirans regularly deal with further suggesting some multiplicity or undescribed control over him. I'd assumed this would be developed further in the book but sadly it wasn't. 

2. Balveda's physical change - so if she was a changer Horza would know? Does this mean the culture have essentially created an analogous type of human to do the same thing or maybe this was just a one off? In the epilogue it talks about how the Culture can change much about a person so maybe it's just that.

3. The narrator describes Dorolow's book she has with her. Its stated that it's her favourite book and is a fictional story and then the first line is read. That line sounds familiar, I assumed it was her religious book but is it another scifi book? I had instinctively thought maybe it was the start of this book thus suggesting some prophetic or time traveling twist but I went back and checked and it's not. I can't shake the feeling that I know it though. 

I appreciate maybe there's no answers to these questions and maybe they're not the most relevant that the book throws out even. I did read that Banks' intentions were to show that essentially you could write about (and this is my interpretation of what he said) cogs in the wheel and that even though those cogs might not change the universe their story is no less compelling. I do  agree with him (I was actually surprised with that) - it's actually MORE powerful and clearly much more real that all that struggle and death all, ultimately has no grand effect. And that those that survive it are damaged as a result (Balveda), all the while those on the peripheries just move on as if it was just another job (Fal 'Ngeestra). Ultimately that's not how I want all my scifi to go but it was a refreshing change.",books,2804
"Has anyone read these? I got through the first book thinking it was some well written raunchy erotica but MY GOD the following books take such a clever and beautiful turn, I couldn‚Äôt put them down. I adored every single character and their nuances. The ties between Catholicism and the erotic were so interesting, the relationships between the characters were crafted with perfection. I can‚Äôt believe I can‚Äôt find any discussions of them anywhere. Smart, sexy, dramatic and most importantly one of those series where I came away feeling like a better, more rounded and more open minded person for reading them. I implore you to read them because they are just SO GOOD.

If you're just recommending a series without saying why or your  whole explanation fits int he title, how are you convincing someone to  read it?

I remember they were graphic novels, and they would have been printed in the 70s or 80s. The cover of one of them was yellow. Inside, I remember there were images of women on horses, bare chested, like Lady Godiva, and for some reason, the plot line seemed to be something like space fantasy or alien fantasy. 

If I remember the plot line correctly, it had something to do with a normal human being traveling to alien worlds and meeting, in one case, a tribe of Amazonian alien women, and being held hostage by them. I think. The graphic novels were in color. They were quite big, as graphic novels usually are. If anyone has any leads on the title or author, it would help. I read these when I was seven or eight.

Yes it‚Äôs true, as embarrassing as it is.
I have not read a single book since middle school and that is years ago.
With this quarantine going on and my depression, I have been wanting more distractions to help me get by, and even though ‚Äúgaming‚Äù has helped me a bit, It can get pretty expensive and also time consuming and seems not so productive, so I much rather spend that time reading books.

Any types of books, DYI stuff, learning skills, Great stories, long books, hell even stuff with pictures, I enjoy history as well, pretty much anything that will not put me to sleep on a pointless topic, I would much rather grab a new hobby that will help me obtain a new skill or tell me a good story!

Since it‚Äôs been a while I used to read a lot of the Harry Potter books, Ernest Hemingway was also one of my first picks, and Poems by Oscar Wilde and mainly all that clich√© stuff but I want to get more suggestions or random stuff from the people who have been reading most of their lives.

I learnt to play guitar from books, and read sheet music, so maybe now a new language?
How to build stuff? Learn about some historical figure or whatever it may be! Where should I begin?

And Im also currently finishing up The Witcher series, which was awesome until Lady of the Lake, which Im having a super hard time with and am mostly just finishing to be done with. 

*It was a lot to type all the authors out so let me know if you want me to add one",books,1100
"And I have a lot of emotions about it. The story is so beautifully communicated in a way that genuinely made me feel sad and depressed for Holden, even though at the same time I recognize he‚Äôs not really a protagonist. 

I won‚Äôt lie, the ending when he‚Äôs describing Phoebe going around on the merry-go-round and being happy really hit me emotionally. It‚Äôs a weird feeling, connecting with someone for the wrong reasons. I don‚Äôt identify with Holden now, but I definitely remember that feeling of the whole world being phony. Undoubtedly this is a love-it-or-hate it book and I think for me it stays in the love-it column. Who knows maybe in another 10 years it‚Äôll switch on me. 

I think the only way to enjoy the book and fully appreciate it is to recognize that you‚Äôre not really supposed to like Holden, he‚Äôs designed to be in likable and flawed. (Which is super telling about his own psyche since he‚Äôs telling the story from his own perspective)

Idk, I just finished and am still processing. Would love to hear others views on this one. I also don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs something (for me) I could really appreciate in high school like I do now.",books,1140
"Didn't watch the movies before (and until now) , I already had the strong feeling and motivation that I will read this books one day. I didn't want to be spoiled by the movies.

I was dying to read it but I prefer physical books as I already have a bad eyesight and e-books make my eye sore. I didn't have enough money then to buy the complete series.

Just this August, I bought myself the complete series as a gift of my first year anniversary being employed. I WAS JUST SO HAPPY WHEN I RECEIVED THEM THROUGH MAIL!!!

And now I've finished Philosopher's Stone, OH WOW, HOW MAGICAL IT IS! I really admire Rowling as an author, creating a world, a new language of spells and potions, it was beyond amazing!!

I have a strong feeling also that this series will be dear to me, as I already shed tears when Dumbledore said the thing about being loved, even when that person is gone, how that love will continue to protect us forever. I remembered my grandfather who passed away just this March. Plus the fact that Hogwarts will be one of the world I escaped to during this pandemic... 

I already said too much, sorry! Just wanted to share this wonderful reading experience to y'all.

"I read the latter in high school and it gripped me and Huxley‚Äôs soft despotism of pleasure is eerily similar to 21st-century America.

I read 1984 last year and it just didn‚Äôt really grip me and the only country I can think of where it might come close to describing the lived reality there is North Korea.

"I'm in my late 30's, been an avid reader since elementary school. I didn't know initially, but I found out at some point that I read faster than average. Generally between 400 and 550 words per minute, or roughly 90 to 100+ pages per hour. When ""in the zone"" with a book I've actually read at over 700 words per minute. 

It's how I've always read, not rushing or anything. This seems to relate to ability to visualize the content in novels, as I've always read technical and programming books more slowly.

Lately, I've been frustrated because it seemed like it was taking a long time to finish books. I checked, and my reading speed seems to have dropped a good deal. It's not around 275 to 350 words per minute. I don't know why.

I'm not experiencing any sort of cognitive decline that I can tell and I've still been reading a lot of books, but it's kind of driving me up the wall because for probably the first time ever I'm growing a backlog of books to read faster than I can read them. Books I used to read in a day or two can now take 4 days. Longer books that might have taken days can take a week or more. Heck, with less free time lately I've been reading 1Q84 off and on since August 2nd and I'm only 65% through it.

I feel weird about this, as it feels like I've lost something. Real life impact is probably minimal but it still feels that way.  And I hope it's temporary, maybe due to stress due to everything going on this year. But I don't know. Has anyone ever experienced something like this?",books,1512
"I have always been a huge fan of Orwell and 1984 and would often argue that the book predicted a lot of things about world politics correctly. However, I finally got to read Brave New World last week. And man, it is actually the true order of the world. This post is not argue which book is better. It's just an appreciation of Huxley's world-building. As per me, we're being controlled yes, but without 1984's upfront and ruthless hate.

I'll let this quote by Neil Postman sum it up:

""What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one. Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egoism. Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance. Orwell feared we would become a captive culture. Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture, preoccupied with some equivalent of the feelies, the orgy porgy, and the centrifugal bumblepuppy.

In short, Orwell feared that what we hate will ruin us. Huxley feared that what we love will ruin us.""",books,1232
"I liked the book but I didn't get that much out of it I think that it might be an eye opening for people living in racist countries and that it teach you a little about morality but for me I think that the reason why it didnt change my perspective is because I don't live in a country like old America nor do I struggle with the issues that the characters face.
I'm new to reading and I don't know if this was because of my lack of reading or if I couldn't understand the book better because of my lack of social experience but I find myself getting more out of nonfiction books.

Do you get more out of nonfiction than fiction books?

"I've recently been very into classical literature since I've found that it's an invaluable resource for getting to know various cultural quirks and social norms, albeit they are often outdated by a century or two, which seem quite foreign yet intriguing to me. From this venture into classical literature I've also found out that I love observing how language evolves, how various registers are used and comparing ye olden tongue with the new one, as well how it affects writing. Sometimes, even the execution of a piece, e.g., epistolary novel, gives me an immense sense of admiration towards an author, now to mention the ideas which the author might try to convey. Therefore, in order to share my experiences and, perhaps, engage You into sharing Your own observations on the subject I've decided to write up this post.

Then, if I may start, I'll begin with a Lithuanian novel, which I'm sure almost none of you have heard of, *Auk≈°tuj≈≥ ≈†imoni≈≥ likimas* (lit. *The Fate Of ≈†imonys From Auk≈°tujai*) by Ieva Simonaitytƒó.

The novel is basically a saga of family spanning for three generations. However, instead of following the family as a whole, the fate of an individual is far more important and it is extremely noticeable towards the end of the novel when it starts following estranged members of the family. This format, as far as I know, has never been attempted in Lithuanian literature before and the only other similar successful attempt was *Silva Rerum* by Kristina Sabaliauskaitƒó, which was released almost 70 years later. 

The characters themselves are extremely well written, each of them being unique in their actions, feelings, sense of morals, attachments and virtue. The most important and memorable episodes in the book and character building involve senses of shame, guilt and hopelessness, arising from jealousy, inability to resist temptations or simply cruelness of fate. It's not to say that the novel is all doom and gloom, there are plenty of bright and cheerful moment of familial happiness and general success and Simonaitytƒó combines intertwines them masterfully. All these passages do provide a didactic element to them but the readers themselves have to draw the conclusions instead of blindly following the word of the narrator.

And the writing itself is superb. There are very few Lithuanian writers which I could lump with Simonaitytƒó of having mastered the Word. The language is rich and vivid, every word and phrase is carefully chosen and incorporated while not overbearing the reader to make reading as delightful and wholesome as possible while also having the potential to be as heartrending as possible. Even highly respected Lithuanian literary critics (namely Vytautas Kubilius) praised her style and language.",books,2757
"I just finished The Great Gatsby and man I loved it. Fastest book I've read and filled with some of the most beautiful sentences to ever be printed on page. Upon watching the movie though (2013) I can't help but blame Gatsby too for his downfall and that Tom isn't portrayed as bad in the book. Now I agree, he shouldn't have cheated on Daisy with Myrtle, but his wife is sleeping with another man, how else would he react? Still, solid book, so happy I got around to reading it.",books,479

"I finished reading Orlando by Virginia Woolf two nights ago and have been stewing over it ever since.  I had never read any of her works before, but saw the movie with my friend recently and it really just grabbed ahold of something in my brain that made me seek out the book.

The thing I like most about the book is the way Virginia Woolf is able to paint a scene.  She describes everywhere in a way that I found really engaging.  I am also big on history, so this fictional biography that takes place over 400 years was right up my alley.  I think she did a pretty good job keeping the story grounded in its historical setting without bogging it down in it.

I think that Orlando is a very interesting exploration into identity.  Orlando starts out as a fairly shallow young man who is constantly having flings with the women around him but eventually ends the story as an accomplished poet who married her ridiculously named soulmate (seriously, the dudes name is Marmaduke Bonthrop Shelmerdine, esq).  At the end of the book, she reflects on all the different people she's been and wonders which one is really her before realizing that they all are.  This really got me thinking about what makes me me.  He gets his heart broken, travels to distant lands, becomes a woman, roams with nomads, writes poetry, gets married, and lives through hundreds of years of change and development.  The sheer difference between who he is when he starts and who she is when she ends is staggering, but even through so much change she accepts that she is still herself.

I really enjoyed Virginia Woolf's writing style and I am definitely going to pick up a few more of her books in the future.",books,1683
"Read Aldous Huxley's 'Brave New World' and felt this really strong urge to write my thoughts about it. Numerous books are written everyday but only few pass the test of time. Brave New World is one such book. It is something which is way way ahead of its time. 

When Aldous wrote the book, he had this idea that the only way forward to achieve stability: be it social, political, economical is through a totalitarian regime. He absolutely believed that some powerful people need to control the actions of the population and tell them what to do in order to achieve stability and any form of order is better than chaos.

According to him, the people who control the world in the book are not anarchists, rather are people who want to bring stability.The book was written in 1932 and we all know the events that occurred after that.

With Hitler's dictatorship, the rise of communist government in the Soviet union, people started perceiving the book as a dystopia showing the ramifications of a totalitarian regime. 
When I say that Brave new world was way way ahead of its time, it is because of the subjects Aldous dealt in the book and predicted quite accurately.
*He rightly predicted the problem of overpopulation.
*He predicted the rise of consumerism and capitalism.
*He quite nicely predicted the rise of science and technology and its effects on human behaviour.
*His prediction regarding sexual freedom.
*His prediction regarding the rise of divorces and failure of marriages.
*His prediction regarding the degradation of emotional attachment among the people.

Now, people may say that some of these things are very common and anyone could have predicted them but what makes Aldous's work special is the manner in which he had given those predictions. The premise, the world which he thought of at that time was unimaginable yet it has very much become the way he imagined.

Aldous beautifully dealt with the differences in the standard of living of the people living in developed countries and people living in underdeveloped countries. Interestingly, that difference can also be seen between people belonging to upper echelon of the society living in posh and urban areas and people belonging to the lower strata living in the rural areas of India.
The system of class and caste divide shown in Brave New World prevails in every country of the world. Aldous had asked some very pertinent questions through his work.
*Will you prefer to be happy all the time if you are conditioned to be so?
*Will you be able to feel real pleasure without the presence of pain?
*Will you love to have stability at the cost of individual freedom?
*Will you want to enjoy sexual freedom if you are conditioned to not have any emotional attachment?

For me, Brave New World is a book which will never lose its value. It can be considered as a satire, blueprint, dystopia, utopia based on one's interpretation but one thing that is very certain about it is that it is a must must read.",books,2977

"Ich schreibe bereits seid zwei Jahren an dem ersten Teil von dem was einmal eine Romanreihe werden soll.
Diese Buchidee habe ich schon lange. In einer apokalyptischen Welt wird der Hauptcharakter, Varian in einen religi√∂sen Katzenstamm geboren, in diesem Stamm sind alle Katzen schneewei√ü. Wei√ü wird dort als Farbe der Reinheit angesehen doch Varian ist bis auf seine wei√üen Ohrenspitzen vollkommen schwarz. In den heiligen Schriften des Katzenstammes steht das eine im Stamm geborene schwarze Katze den Stamm ausl√∂schen wird. Weil er nicht ganz schwarz ist wird er am leben gelassen, wird allerdings nichts weiter au√üer rumgeschubst und schlecht behandelt, sein einzigster Freund Jay, ein blinder und winziger Kater hat ein √§hnlich schlimmes Schicksal wie er, nur das er darunter leidet das man ihm nichts zutraut und es ihn schon extreme M√ºhe gekostet hat das er nicht direkt zu den zu alten Katzen gebracht wird, die dem Stamm nicht mehr dienen k√∂nnen und das obwohl er mehr als nur sehr begabt ist zb als Assassine und konfrontierender K√§mpfer, er rutscht genauso in die Depressionen ab wie Varian und dreht schlu√üendlich durch. Dies bemerken die Stammesmitglieder aber erst als er den Anf√ºhrer im Kampf t√∂tet, was er tut um zu beweisen das er genauso gut ist wie die anderen. (Um ehrlich zu sein ist er besser als die meisten). Danach fl√ºchtet Jay, was Varian gebrochen zur√ºckl√§sst, (ab da wird er f√ºr tot gehalten) er lebt nur noch als H√ºlle vor sich hin, nach ungef√§hr einem Jahr berichten Sp√§her des Stammes das erste mal von kleineren Katzenversammlungen am Rand ihres Territoriums. Der Stamm unternimmt nichts aber mit der Zeit √ºberschreitem die Katzengruppen immer wieder die Grenzen und werden auch gr√∂√üer. Der Stamm erkennt die fremden Katzen zu sp√§t als Bedrohung und wird von einem Massenangriff √ºberw√§ltigt. Die vielen kleinen Gruppen sind eigentlich eine gro√üe Armee aus fr√ºher unorganisierten und st√ºmperhaften Katzen, sie kommen alle aus dem angrenzenden Schneetorritorium, wo es kaum Fressen gibt, doch bisher waren sie nicht stark genug um in das Territorium des Stammes einzudringen. Doch ein geheimnissvoller Kater hat sie alle unter einer Flagge vereint und sie ausgebildet, sie nennen sich die sehende Flagge. Das ganze entwickelt sich zu einem blutigen Krieg mit ungef√§hr gleichstarken Seiten. In einer gro√üen Schlacht, ist auch das erste mal der gegnerische Anf√ºhrer an der Spitze, Varian sieht sich seinem alten Freund gegen√ºber und der erste Roman endet (Es wird eine Fortsetzung geben). Es geht um Rassismus, die Guten und schlechten Seiten von Religion, sowie, was ich am besten finde: es gibt keine b√∂se Seite. Ich nenne die Buchreihe Tales of Dark und den ersten Teil vermutlich Open Eyes oder What you cant see. Es gibt noch so einige Nebenstorystr√§ngw, zb den von Varians Schwester, aber das ist eine andere Geschichte. (Sry for speaking german)",books,2880
"I really got into reading this year (finished nine books so far - my goal is to get to twelve by the end of the year) so I bought a kindle on my friend's recommendation but.... I hardly use it. It's better than reading on my phone I guess but it still feels like I'm just holding and looking at yet another screen in my everyday life. Not only that, but the screen is in black and white and a lot of non-fiction I read has pictures that are useless without color. The formatting also seems off sometimes. On the other hand it's got less distractions than my phone, has cheaper and more readily available books than searching bookstores for used physical copies. It's got pros and cons for sure, but between physical books and my cell phone the kindle just seems like an unnecessary third option.

"I first discovered this edition when Christopher Hitchens was giving a tour of his DC apartment and he talked about the books. Hitch was a huge fan of Orwell, and if you have not listened to his discussion about Orwell with George Packer then I highly recommend it. Both of them are (with Hitch I suppose it is the past tense) huge Orwell nerds and it's well worth listening to.

I searched for this set for years, and years, and years. I want to say something like 15 years before I found it. A friend text me last year to say it's in a bookshop in DC, and he got me in touch with the owner.

This is one of my most loved possessions, along with some autographed books from Hitch.

I've been working my way through all of it albeit slowly. I had already read all of Orwell's books, and his collection of essays by George Packer, so a lot of this is not new.

Today I started &amp; finished Volume 10 which is the first collection of letters, essays, and book reviews. It starts with a letter to his mother when he was 6 years old. It's really interesting to see his writing ability progress as he ages. 

Of note was a letter to Brenda which breaks down Ulysses and made me realise I know far less about that text than I previously thought. An absolute gem of a letter.

I also found another bit amusing - Orwell hated A Clergyman's Daughter and I think it's one of his best novels, whereas he loved Burmese Days and I found that quite boring. 

His letters with Arthur Miller are also interesting. I suppose the only thing missing is the responses from these people, it would have been nice to see the entire conversation with Miller.

I still have volumes 11 - 20 to read, but I had to get this off my chest and I have nobody to talk to about this. Sitting here in my office now with a whiskey contemplating opening volume 11, or waiting until tomorrow so I can digest everything I have just read.

"Joshua Lethem is of course the author of novels such as *Guns, with Occasional Music;* *Motherless Brooklyn;* and *The Fortress of Solitude*\-- which was adapted into a musical in 2012.

I've often found that Lethem's work is fairly polarizing, with some people I've talked to describing him as one of the worst authors around with confusing, terrible, and pretentious prose. Some of the other people I discussed this with thought his work was genius and deeply underappreciated. 

I personally have only read *The Fortress of Solitude* but I enjoyed it quite a bit even if there were parts of the book that I thought needed some editing. I thought the story was deeply moving and insightful, but with a second half that was considerably worse than the first half.

I looked at Lethem on Goodreads and opinions on him there were also fairly divided.

"With all this newly found time to read (thanks quarantine) I decided to take upon the task of reading the works of Ernest Hemingway. A favorite writer of mine, Hunter S. Thompson said that Hemingway was a significant influence on him so I'll certainly take his word on it. I haven't read everything by him yet, but here is the order that I read everything along with short reviews of what I thought:

To Have and Have Not: Heard that Hemingway believed this to be his least favorite novel that he wrote but I was appealed to it by the short length so I read this first. I actually really enjoyed it. I thought the plot was entertaining along with the scenery in Cuba. Characters weren't anything special to be attached to but I was intrigued nonetheless.

In Our Time: This is a short story collection and all I can say is that I love his short stories. I found them incredibly well written and unique. Totally check out his short stories first, if you're thinking about reading Hemingway's work.

Men Without Women: Another short story collection, not much more to be said than what I stated before. This collection was still highly enjoyable and worth reading. 

Across The River and Into The Trees: Apparently when this book was originally released everyone hated it for its dark tone. The book is a significant departure of the adventurous vibe that a lot of his other works have and I honestly, found it to be incredibly refreshing. I didn't mind the change of attitude and dealing with the serious topic of a man approaching the end of his life and nostalgia of his past. Maybe not the first book you would want to read by Hemingway but worth it down the line.

A Farewell To Arms: Absolutely loved this book. I'll admit that I'm a sucker for love stories and I thought this one had a really cool setting. Soldier falls for a nurse in Italy during World War I, couldn't be more entertained. The ending is pretty ""slap in your face"" like but I thought that it fit the scenery of the story. Couldn't recommend this book more.

The Sun Also Rises: Very good, but doesn't have a lot of the emotional impact that I got from his other novels. I just thought that this book was highly entertaining with the cast of characters going to every restaurant and Bullfight in Spain partying their behinds off in the twenties. There is a main story about the protagonist being in love with a girl who is promiscuous and he can't be with her because of an injury from World War I but it was lacking compared to the conflicts that ""A Farewell To Arms"" dealt with. Still, this is a good book and one of Hemingway's most well known.

The Old Man and The Sea: Practically one of his short stories in novella form. This book is a classic tale of man vs. nature and its highly enjoyable. I think most people have either read and/or heard of this book more than any other work by Hemingway. I enjoyed it but I'll admit I think that the critical acclaim that I've heard about the book receiving left me with a feeling of it being overrated after I finished reading. Don't get me wrong, this is a classic story, I just think everything else was way better.

For Whom The Bell Tolls: Now this.....this is one of the best books I've ever read. I always known that this book was the basis for the Metallica song of the same name (exactly based on Chapter 27 a matter of fact) but reading this book was an emotional trip. I felt like this book had everything I could ever want from a reading experience. It has action, emotion, great characters, twists, and even a love story I found myself incredibly invested in. Easily the longest book of Hemingway's but well worth reading. The writing itself is remarkable feat that must be adored. Surprised I don't see a lot of people talk about it more on this sub.

A Moveable Feast: The first straight forward nonfiction book I read of Hemingway's and is highly entertaining. The same feeling I got reading ""The Sun Also Rises"" with everyone just going to random restaurants and drinking the nights away is great, especially this time around because it actually happened. Hemingway's interactions with other writers of his era is all the more intriguing. If you're looking for a good book about people just ""living the life"" this is the best of what you can find.

Islands In The Stream: This book was apparently of the lasts that Hemingway was working on before he died. He was also writing it during a time that was incredibly difficult for him mentally and it can show. I felt like a good core of the story here is well but it can drag at points. The characters weren't the most interesting and the emotional moments of the story don't hit as hard as they're suppose to. It's a good book though, maybe I would go far as to say that it is even underrated but I can understand why a lot of people may have forgotten about this one.

The Garden of Eden: Unfinished novel that he was writing and severely edited from what I understand. What makes this book so interesting is the fact that it explores the gender roles of a marriage and can certainly come off pretty odd of a story. The wife wants to be the man in the marriage to her husband so she begins to dress like one and everything. Not saying there is anything wrong with that, Im just surprised that Hemingway wrote this kind of story. All of his ""couples"" in his other work are incredibly straight forward which I always accustomed to the time period for which his work was written. With that being said, this book was fascinating at the least, but in terms of overall quality, it is lacking in his long line of work.

True At First Light: Easily my least favorite of all the works I have read so far. This book was also heavily edited and large sections of the book were completely taken out. The title isn't even made up by Hemingway but his son came up with it. Just a story of a married couple going to Africa and having some problems along the way. Obviously, inspired by Hemingway's marriage to Mary Welsh and their trips to Africa. The story just isn't that appealing and you can tell it wasn't thoroughly finished. I'd save this book for hardcore Hemingway fans only.

By Line: Ernest Hemingway: This is a collection of a good majority of Hemingway's journalist articles. Honestly, this is a book that is a great reference guide to writing Reddit posts haha. Very enjoyable with interesting articles that go through all kinds of topics. 

So that's what I've read so far. I plan to get to ""Green Hills of Africa"" eventually but reading through everything so far, I feel pretty burned out and want to read someone else for awhile. I'd love to hear everyone else's thoughts on Hemingway's work.",books,6679

"When I try to explain this to people I'm met with everything fr civil disagreement to full on rage, but I didn't like Dune. Frank Herbert is a very talented world-builder, I'll give him that. Conceptually, it's a fantastic story. Actually reading it, however, was not an enjoyable experience for me. The world is filled with cardboard characters who had unrealistic, boring dialogue and thoughts. I really disliked the paragraph-long, fully formed thoughts of all the characters - nobody thinks like that. And death scenes were silly; the overuse of ellipsis got in the way of what the characters were saying. Plus the characters lacked nuance and complexity. 

I love science fiction, but the reason I read sci-fi is to better understand humans, not to look at another world. Thoughts? Can anyone convince me otherwise? (Legitimately, if you disagree, please let me know. Maybe there's something huge I'm missing)",books,914

"So my problem is that I have a difficult time reading through books that are heavily pictorial. Those type of books usually are fiction in my case. I'm a Philosophy major so with that comes reading texts are are often labelled 'dry' but I found that, for instance, J.S Mill's *Utilitarianism* was a very straight to the point text with minimal illustration. It gives us a brief overview and then picks up speed. Now there are people like Camus or Nietzsche who write in beautiful prose no doubt, but I just seem to get bored and lose concentration because of their paragraph long allegories and character offshoots.

So I've come to you, /r/books, to help me overcome this inability to read descriptive books. I bought Jane Austen's *Pride and Prejudice* and Charlotte Bront√´'s *Jane Eyre* from a used bookstore to dive into it. I also am trying to get into Shakespeare (for my English Lit paper) and I've been facing similar issues.

"I love Virginia Woolf's Mrs Dalloway, but I must admit I am a little indifferent towards To the Lighthouse. I keep on reading that most academics and critics consider Lighthouse the superior novel, and I really do admire its intricate structure, but I feel that Mrs Dalloway has more life to it--its characters are just more vivid and memorable, in my opinion.

"I‚Äôve finished for a while now, and thought ‚Äúhey, I loved reading it! Why not make a review?‚Äù And this is my review of A Man Called Ove!
*i decided to make this as Spoiler-free as possible*

Ove, the grumpiest and most old fashioned man to exist. Lives alone in a neighborhood full of seemingly lesser stooges who (to him) live by leeching off his expertise and his ‚Äúknow-it-all‚Äù behavior. 
This story begins with a hilarious character that one begins to love to hate. His old-fashioned mentality brings about hysterical situations with other different-minded people, be it stupid ones, or those who adapted with the new flow of modern life (those of whom Ove loathed intensely). 
And though the comical genius of this story, it does a lot of other things immensely right. This story is serious when it needs to be and when it is you feel the rhythm of every scene, every page. It delves into characters and their relationships, sometimes these relationships are beautiful, sometimes they‚Äôre just outright tragic. 
This story writes emotion in a hilarious yet beautifully tear-jerking way. A joke can be told in the most serious of times, but it doesn‚Äôt bog down the entire narrative with one fell swoop. The jokes are perfect, I‚Äôm fact too perfect. The jokes themselves are not some ‚Äúknock knock‚Äù joke or even any ‚Äúbrillant‚Äù verbal joke, it‚Äôs just how the characters react to their surroundings, how they react to a situation they‚Äôre in, how they answer a question they‚Äôve been dreading. This works for only one reason; the characters are personalities of their own, each opposes the other in a way that works, it‚Äôs like a giant puzzle that gives you the shape of a tree while none of the pieces are connected (save for a few). And I‚Äôm saying that in a positive way of course.


This story is hilarious, beautiful, tragic, but most importantly brilliant. It‚Äôs every step works to an end you dread to reach, you wonder whether it‚Äôll happen or won‚Äôt (or even how it‚Äôll happen) characters appear and challenge Ove each in their own unique way. And Ove being his grumpy-self revolts these challenges in his own way, ones that introduce laughter and the curious eyes of the reader. This is something worth the read, enjoyment is one of the many things you‚Äôll draw from this amazing piece of work.",books,2291

"To preface: I used to utterly devour books when I was a teenager and now that I'm 15 years older a lot of that speed is gone. 

Now that I'm writing this it occurs to me that perhaps I'm not being fair to myself because back then all the books I read were in my native language, they were targeted towards young teenagers, they had a page count that never went higher than 250 and the books I'm trying to read now are all fat 500+ page blobs filled with (in my opinion) difficult English literature.

I've been recommended books like The God Delusion and authors like Dostoyevski and Jack London but after about 45 minutes my head feels like it's being filled with concrete. It's just unpleasant and stressful when I don't understand some of the words on the pages.

"I read ARC for Booksprout because i love supporting new and upcoming authors and finding new or interesting series that I like a lot! 

I have seen and read my fair share of bad reviews and honestly agree with most of them but I read one this morning that has me absolutely fuming!

I was reading the ARC (Advanced Reader Copy) for a Book called ""Ora and The Old God"" which is the first book by the author and is a quick read that I thought was excellently executed and set up the continuation of the story for the next book. 

So i go and I leave my review in the various places i am suppose to and i go to good reads and I see the only review it has so far is a 3 star review! So i check it out and it just blew me away and has me so pissed off. 

This lovely story that I read in a single sitting about a girl that reminded me a lot of my daughter was getting trashed because the main character hadn‚Äôt been sexualized and recommended that the main character fall in love with the person who enslaved her and is torturing her‚Ä¶. Like holy shit! WTF!! That is god damn stockholm syndrome and as a survivor of a VERY abusive relationship I can't imagine why this person would want to see someone stay with and fall in love with the person who is abusing them physically, emotionally, and mentally! And especially i cant understand why someone would want that in a young adult novel.

"The book that I would like some help is Systematic Theology by Charles Hodge. I got a copy of it which the seller told it was from 1871. I then began a quest to identify if it is the first edition first print but the more that I look, the hardest it has gotten to find it out if my copy is authentic or it is just a very later copy to resemble the first edition. 

I first began my investigation by looking up information regarding Charles Scribner's Sons history. They first began as "" Charles Scribner and Company"" that after Charles's death in 1871 their sons changed to ""Scribner, Armstrong, and Company"", ""  In 1877, the publication house moved to 743 Broadway."" Later in 1878, they changed the company name to ""Charles Scribner's Sons."" 

I then began to search for copies of first editions online to compare with mine. This is my [copy](https://imgur.com/9c3Shwj).

I then found someone who had the first edition on a blog post, I contacted him and he sent me his [first edition](https://imgur.com/k3yJTjn). 

What is weird is the company name on his edition compared to mine. He also have a [second edition](https://imgur.com/P3nO2TK) which has the same company name as it was prior to the change in 1878. If the company changed its name in 1878, this second edition dated from 1883 should have ""Scribner, Armstrong and Company"", instead of the name that it had until 1871. 

All information I got was from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Scribner_I) regarding the founder and the company.

Another detail that came to me was that my copy has the address they used between 1877 until 1893.

Comparing to a [copy](https://imgur.com/f6uaWFz) that the University of Michigan has, this copy also has a different form of the company name.

The library of congress [link](https://openurl.loc.gov/01loc/cgi/core/multi.cgi?sfx.request_id=2949705) tells that it is dated back from 1873. The University of Chicago has the third volume of the series dated from 1874 with the same company writing as the first edition from Michigan's copy. 

I'm hitting a dead end here on determining the age of my copy as it has a very different title stating the address from the company from 1878, but with the company title that dates back prior to the change done in 1871. 

I just wonder what happened that my copy will not state the date as all the other copies I have found too, it is just a ""fake copy"", although the book is very old by its yellowed pages.

Anything will help.",books,2484
"I don‚Äôt know why I consistently find myself floored by Conn Iggulden‚Äôs writing, but once again I have found myself with a whole where his writing sustained me for a few months. I had previously read his Emperor series regarding the life of Julius Caesar (highly recommended), and despite having little interest in the Mongol Empire, decided to give this series a read purely based on the author.

Simply put, Iggulden is a master of historical fiction. Whilst he takes liberties with historical fact in the same manner as his Emperor books or the Falcon of Sparta, that is to be expected when it comes to historical fiction, and I find myself inspired to do further research purely based upon his historical notes at the end of the books anyway! 

Presenting both the stark reality and scale of the task that faced Temujin when he embarked on the journey that would bring him to create the largest land empire in history, Iggulden is completely accurate in describing this as one of the most fascinating ‚Äúrags to riches‚Äù stories of all time. 

If you are at all interested in historical fiction, the various Khanates of the 13th century, or simply just a fan of terrific writing and incredible; albeit ruthless figures, I cannot recommend this series enough.

I've heard a audio book where the reader uses the New Orleans ""slang"" that is described in the book, but I find the book far more entertaining and the character of Ignatius to be far more interesting when he speaks/thinks in the comic book guy voice.  It's so fitting that I had to look up Hank Azaria's influences for the voice to see if Ignatius was mentioned.",books,551
"Before starting this review, I should get this off my chest. I started this book with a biased mindset. I did not expect a book about an aging megastar and her 7 husbands to ever get a 5 star from me. I thought it to be too frivolous, a mindless read between the ""more serious"" books I am reading, a book I would forget as soon as I have finished reading - a good mind break. But then Evelyn happened.  


The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is a crisp small book (having only 7 chapters after each husband of hers)which is written in a very simple way but that which manages to hold your attention and leave you yearning for more after every chapter. Through these seven chapters we see the rise and fall and rise of the unapologetic , courageous and pragmatic Evelyn Hugo. Without giving out too much, this book deals with both LGBTQ+ and minority issue without making the characters solely defined by those. Infact we get to know that one of the characters is a person of color way later into the book. This is a novelty at least for me as I am used to characters whose first few lines clearly establish their minority status (racially, religiously and/or sexually). However, this is not why this book got her 5 stars from me. This book got its 5 stars for how real, flawed , hypocritical and at the same time vulnerable and strong almost all the characters were. Also adding to it was the larger than life moments Evelyn lived. This book at least created the illusion of giving us readers a sneak peak into good old Hollywood, the art of making films, the drive down the memory lane to see how a now iconic moment came into being. I found myself mesmerized and clapping and cheering when a particular scene got shot.  


All in all, this book is like a slice of time frozen in its pages ( The last time I felt something similar was when I read Anna Karenina in 2011). This is a book which has successfully been able to freeze a society with all its peculiarities in its pages. It has been able to show important social events in a simple way without making it lose its gravity but most importantly it has been able to bring out Evelyn , a fictitious character, and make her into a living persona of flesh and blood.  


Read this novel for a pleasant happy exciting read.",books,2273
"I just finished reading *The Right Stuff* by Tom Wolfe and absolutely loved it. Wolfe waxes lyrical about the dawn of the Space Age and his prose is enthralling and almost poetic. But it had a surprisingly powerful impact on how I viewed the movie as well.

I grew up watching *The Right Stuff* pretty regularly with my dad and always thought it was a cool movie but never really put much stock into it. The transition from Yeager breaking the sound barrier to the Mercury program seemed weird and poorly handled, Scott Glenn's portrayal of Alan Shepard seemed all over the place, and there just seemed to be a lot of missing information that could have connected things a little better. So I wrote it off as a ""fun but not great"" movie and left it at that.

Then I read the book. Like I said, it was a great read but more importantly, it did a wonderful job of connecting and explaining everything that I felt was missing in the movie. It clearly lays out the connective thread between Yeager's flight and the Mercury program. Scott Glenn's Shepard was all over the place because *Shepard* as a person was all over the place (mad props to Glenn's performance, apparently!). And there's so much drama that happened behind the screen that the movie just glosses over yet keeps the subtext - hence the ""missing information.""

Having all of that background information, I watched the movie again and thoroughly enjoyed it! As a standalone movie, it remains ""fun but not great"" because it doesn't adequately translate Wolfe's story, but coupled with the book, the nuances of the characters and their interactions *really* shines!",books,1625

"I remember being super excited to buy a copy when I was at the bookstore thinking, this is going to be one of the best dystopian novels out there otherwise it wouldn't have been deemed a classic. Went home, started watching a John Green's crash course on literature, the episode in which he analyses Lord of the Flies and he literally started off with how no one actually likes it because of the kind of unrealistic ideas it brings forth. I still read it, and I don't know if the video influenced my opinion of the novel's contents and ideas, but I felt odd once I had finished it. Literally just that. I felt so distanced from the ideas that were explored in the text and that's not how I usually feel after reading novels that I like. I felt it was really dark in a way that didn't completely make sense. Golding literally turned children into savages. These ""children"" went ahead and killed their own friends and didn't even mourn until the very end. And what in the world was up with the people who rescued them?

"I think I‚Äôm going to get a lot of hate for this statement but..... 

I had hugely high expectations of Silence of the girls. I couldn‚Äôt go on to book suggestions without seeing it everywhere. Coincidently Madeline Millers Circe and Song of Achilles were always uttered in the same breath for obvious reasons. I read Circe some months ago and just finished silence of the girls and I also can‚Äôt help but make a comparison between the two. 
- both written by female authors (awesome) 
- both have female protagonists (awesome) 
- both written in the time period of Ancient Greece. 

But let‚Äôs start with the positives: 
- I love famous/ well known stories retold by a side lined/minor characters perspective And from that angle I was really interested in the story being told because, well it‚Äôs a very interesting story! 
- I have a thing for female protagonists so the fact that this story was told from the perspective  and voices of the women was also brilliant. 
- the major male characters are mythological/ historical figures I‚Äôve grown up with and self studied because I am in love with Greek mythology and it challenged my character conceptions of these individuals, mostly Odysseus - who I‚Äôve developed in my head as a Wiley, clever, wise man who was for the most part benevolent. I very distinctly disliked him in Silence of the girls which made me challenge myself and deeply entrenched views. 

Now for the Negatives: 
- there were at times hints of a modernised language (I‚Äôm not really sure how else to put it) that just grated with me and didn‚Äôt feel true to the setting or the time. 
- I couldn‚Äôt connect with Briseis beyond a surface level and made it very hard to connect with the story and the narrative. This is obviously a very subjective thing and will differ from reader to reader. 
- I can‚Äôt help but compare the writing style of SOTG to Millers Circe, and personally for me Millers is far superior. I haven‚Äôt yet read the song of Achilles yet so I‚Äôm very interested to see if I make as many close comparisons there as well (considering the subject matter I assume I will). 

After I finished reading it, I sat for a minute and quickly decided that it would be going into my donation pile. For me that‚Äôs THE sign that I didn‚Äôt make any kind of connection with it. It was good but it wasn‚Äôt great. Circe on the other hand.... I couldn‚Äôt pick up another book for a couple of days because it stayed with me in quite a profound way....

"I love reading, but no matter how much I loved a book, I never felt the need to tell someone what I read, urge them to read it, or discuss it.

Why would I wanna discuss something that is so subjective? Everyone experiences a book differently. We imagine scenes that we read about using our own imagination which is different for everyone. Different parts of a book connect with us depending on our personal journey through life. Some things may make me pause, and reread them because of how awesome.they are. Some parts may make you tear up, while I might just go over those feeling nothing particularly moving.


Please don't take offense, but I don't particularly care how mesmerised you were by reading a book. I can't be the only one here who feels that books are a singular experience. In other words, I don't need you to salt my soup.

"I was 11 years old when I discovered a paperback copy of The Joy of Sex in my neighbour's house one summer, when I was housesitting and feeding their cats. I knew the dad of the family to be an eclectic sort, who worked at a place called Banana Republic, a clothing store that I think at that time was also a little like Sharper Image, because it also sold gadgets and weird things that billionaires covet. 

The family had three Persian cats, and one of them was a white coated blue eyed one, which, in that particular breed, meant that it was deaf. So, I had to go rooting around the garage that day to find her. I checked under the sofa they had parked in the middle of the space, where a car should be. Nothing. I looked through the tool cabinets, where I was told she liked to hide. And then I looked through this shelf of books . Books were stacked all over it, creating tiny alcoves and cat hiding places. 

I didn't find the cat. I did find this book. And the pubescent me took to it immediately. What a strange and bizarre world this was. people with foreskin. Pubic hair! PUBIC HAIR! Immaculately detailed drawings of insertions and coquettish ""mouth music."" I still remember some of those tart and delicious phrases: Reverse Cowgirl; Bondage! And more and more.

I spend a whole afternoon in the garage reading through this thing. And the point of all of this is, I actually think that this book was what taught me that in between the cover of a book are endless worlds, new ideas. And most of all that language is something more than text on a page. It's a key. Or a door. Or its both at the same time. 

It's the shadow game under a well lit blanket, the finest of movements producing the grandest of gestures. The clasping of hands creating the magical creatures that our own minds fill in with voices that we have yet to really hear.

I just wanted to know if anyone has any resources or strategies that they use to become better readers.

By ""better"" I cast a wide net:

\-How to maintain a regular reading habit

\-What sort of diversity should we bring to our reading choices? (in terms of form, genre, and even content)

\-How do we improve at understanding what they are reading and integrating that knowledge into our own lives

\-How do we improve our reading speed whilst maintaining comprehension

\-How do we approach reading different kinds of books differently? (basically, having different reading approaches depending on whether we are reading philosophy, fiction, social science, etc.)

Any and all advice is appreciated :)",books,735
"Hooo boy, I started reading this last week and I'm more than halfway through. I have been in a dry spell reading for a while and this book has reignited my flame. I can't seem to put it down. I think the author does a wonderful job painting pictures in my head. Everything is so detailed, and I just love that it takes place in ancient Egypt. I will definitely be reading the other 5 books in this series.",books,405
"Sometimes the book I'm reading has a plot on wiki which helps, but a lot of the time it has nothing. 

I have a bad memory from medication and mental illness but I love reading. I forget to take notes and if I put a book down for 2 weeks, I can never remember what happened before unless I read the plot points and stop at where I need to.

Is there a website that sort of just lists the plot points as bullet points with some sort of spoiler covering?

If not someone should whip one up real quick and just add all the books ever written to it. No takers?

"I haven't read a lot of fictional books, I have read bunch of Dan brown, lord of the rings and books like ""alchemist"" which are always on your face. 

How do I end up reading Lolita then ? 
I heard about it in this movie called ""captain fantastic"" like 3-4 years ago and the description that was given in the movie by that girl intrigued me. 

My first try: 
I ordered Lolita just after watching that movie and I gave up before the first part ends. I realize I need to stay away from this filthy dude's thoughts, it disgusted me and made me hate the guy who was narrating the story. 

A month ago, I was cleaning my room and found ""Lolita"" lying in the corner. It is the only book I never finished, so I thought I just might as well get through the story. I started from the beginning but this time.... Oh this time it got me good .... 

I was paying attention to this character, this fucking pedophile, he is disgusting, his thoughts are disgusting but then why am I feeling sorry for him at the end?, why am I crying when he is crying?, Why do I want him to be happy?

I don't want to spoil it for anyone, so I am just gonna say, this book has changed me, this book has changed the way I look at things before it was just black and white but now I see the whole spectrum into the things I have done in my past, to the things that people have done to me and I blamed them ever since. Why a book on pedophile has taught me to forgive people who has done me wrong ? I don't know.

I question myself ... 
What's the appeal of this character ? 
My answer:
We are all scared of our demons and sharing it with the society because we will be judged but this HH guy got so comfortable with his demons that I felt like he was looking down at me, that I am less of a human than he is even though he is more of a monster than I am.
...
That's all I have to say.",books,1851

"I write this post at the very early hours of morning after devouring *Fire and Blood* in a span under 48 hours. I used to be an avid reader some quarter of my life ago when I was middle school. I remember the last books I was engrossed in was the Kingdom Keepers series and even then starting to fall out of reading due to their lack of resolution or risk. Then my early high school years came and assigned readings destroyed my desire to read even further (although I vaguely remember my occassional rereading of Timothy Zahn's Thrawn trilogy whenever my family went camping). During this time I started to gravitate towards nonfiction and thoroughly became a student of history (and in college taxes and such). 

Before starting *Fire and Blood* I had already seen all of the TV show and knew the lands of Ice and Fire pretty thoroughly after listening to speculation videos before falling asleep. I don't know what exactly about Aegon the Conqueror that fascinated me so but it tickled the history student part of my brain and I decided to start with *Fire and Blood* (Plus I didn't want to get wrapped up in the main series waiting for a new book. Sorry George take your time!) 

Now having read through this masterpiece I can see why so many people love George R. R. Martin. The whole series feels like something that actually could of happened along with pieces lost to history or waived off as supernatural and unreal. So thanks again George! I don't know where I go from here but... Long live Good Queen Alysanne!",books,1521
"I finally decided to sink my teeth into this great modern novel, and I'm just finding it awfully repetitive. I'm at Chapter 13 now (Ormsby translation), and basically all of Don Quixote's encounters seem to go like this:

&gt; Don Quixote decides to beat something/someome up because he believes he's a knight

&gt; Sancho Panza tries to convince him otherwise but fails

&gt; Both of them get beaten up instead; Don Quixote finds some knightly excuse for this

&gt;Rinse and repeat

"Due to work and school, I was unable to read this year. I thought I would actually have more time due to Covid-19 but it was the opposite. It was also terrible timing for me because the last book of one of my favorite trilogies had just been released but I couldn‚Äôt find the time to read more than two pages. 

Well, I had to go into isolation due to being exposed at work so I thought this was finally the time for me to finish The Toll by Neal Shusterman.

Do I distract myself with something more mundane? How do I even process moving on from one world to another?

The way I feel now I remember feeling every time I would finish a book, and the stages of grief are the best way to explain how I cope with finishing a book. It takes me a couple of days until I‚Äôm able to pick up another book.

Never have I ever been so deeply enthralled in a book. Despite its length (I read the unabridged 1471 page edition, which I highly recommend) The Count of Monte Cristo was impossible to put down. I was engulfed by the world that Dumas creates in this masterpiece. The satisfaction of the events of the plot, the countless messages and themes and morals, and the gorgeous writing itself that Dumas used - I can talk about these probably for ever. God the language - Dumas is probably the most beautiful and talented writer I‚Äôve ever read. His sentences and words not only kept me engaged, but enriched my mind and tugged at my heart. Never have I been so moved, so touched, so engaged in a story, as if I were Dant√®s or Merc√©d√®s or Maximilien themselves or any other character mentioned. As I read, I experienced what they experienced, I rejoiced at their victories, and felt pain at their sorrows.

"Please let me know if this isn't the right subreddit.

First time author, though I've written hundreds of pages of poetry by now. I've been working on an outline and rough draft for several weeks now and am running into significant problems with a work of this scale.

The first major arc follows God (a woman) as she battles with a manipulative and abusive king who seeks to overthrow and replace her. The second major arc follows her recovery and healing by discovering romance with a man also scarred by the tyrannical king.

I'm having concrete problems with putting these ideas to paper:

* How do I do dialogue without sounding like a broken record? ""X"", said A. ""Y"", B responds. ""Z"", responds A. *and so on and so on and oh god make it stop*
* How do I write engaging romance without making their actions sound contrived or corny? Specifically, with one of the two being God in female form, how do I write a convincing story about sexual discovery and intimacy? Everything I've tried so far sounds like a terrible Lovecraftian fanfic.
* The violence is intended to be vague in some parts and graphic in others. How in the world do I write graphic violence without making the reader sick or forcing them to put the story down? I want to capture the thoughts of the two parties and spend less time talking about the violence itself.

Writing a novel is nothing like writing poetry. I have 30 pages of outline and the bullets are about 2/3rds full. I'm comfortable with flowery writing and using all kinds of (undoubtedly clich√© by now) poetic devices, but none of that helps when writing a conversation between two intelligent and (hopefully) relatable people.

"A long while ago I made an attempt on the mystery genre as a reader and frankly, I didn't like it.

A simple assessment of my experiences was simply that- people didn't react to the big picture.

First book- picked at random, dealt with an assassination attempt on the president via poisoning. After it was determined the food was poisoned people were tracked down and there was a serious shootout. This all happened in the background of course, on television and the protagonist's response to it was...weird. In any other setting, a shootout with assassins would make international news but here, it was hardly worth a mention. I chalked it up to this being a weird thing on part of the author and moved on.

Second book- the protagonist is on vacation and wouldn't you know it, they discover mermaids! Surely the discovery of a previously mythical creature, and one that's an intelligent being no less, would make for a world-shaking discovery. What would the common response be? What would the pope have to say about the existence in mermaids with respect to wider religion as a whole? What about the United Nations- would they declare them a people and respect their claim of the waters as a sovereign nation? All of this immediately becomes irrelevant when someone dies and suddenly it shifts gears to solving that mystery. Not one ounce of weight is given to the truly shocking discovery of intelligent beings on this planet, it was as though people simply forgot the mermaids even existed, their presence a superficial backdrop to the ""mystery"".

It was such a gear shift that after some more picking and prodding I decided ""I do not like mystery"" and went about my life not reading the genre, never looking back.

Sometime nearly a year ago, however, that changed. As I like to do, I pick a variety of settings and settled on ""roman noir"" on a lark, wondering if such a juxtaposition genre even existed. It did.

I was recommended the book ""Roman Blood"" by Steven Saylor- and I loved it. To date, I have no idea what the stance is on the sub-genre ""noir"" within the wider collective that fits the ""mystery"" descriptor but hot damn- I was hooked. I read every single book in that series, about 14, and also the other two monoliths on Rome, ""Roma"" and ""Empire"", whether the author is ever going to write a third book to that extravagant story spanning from the republic to the empire remains to be seen but the point is- I care now.

I have made a point to seek out more, this ""historical mystery/noir"" has been a wellspring for a parched mouth- I simply can't get enough. From there, I read more and from other readers to better understand the settings these books are set in, I have a better understanding of the conditions surrounding the Roman state, how things turned with the introduction of Christianity and how the Bronze Age Collapse really shook things up and how ultimately all that tied up to influence the major Abrahamic religions of today. All this context within context within context sprouting from a single recommendation of ""Roman Blood"".

Would I still recommend those mystery books from above that I didn't like before- after all I've been through in reading these noir? Probably not. But I never expected to have wholeheartedly fallen so in love with this very specific sub-genre of mystery. The mainstream stuff is, to date, still not my stuff. I give it a try every now and then, looking for that exception but I'm still drawn back to stuff set in the ancient world every time.

I guess my advice from all this, if you hate a genre- despise it, gag at the mere sight of it, recoil in abject horror at the mere presence of it before you- maybe try a sub-genre that overlaps with something you're already interested in. There's plenty out there and I'm certainly glad I gave it a shot.

Thanks for any and all suggestions!",books,787
"So I will be without internet and with severely limited space for a time period from 6 months to 10 months. I need book recommendations! Any and all.

"I've recently finished the Necrovamp series by Brett Hicks and started on Return of the Old-Bloods. I finished the 4th book , Orion Rising, but can't find a 5th. The 4th book was released just about a year ago. Does anyone know if the author just stopped writing the series or is waiting to publish the 5th book? I'm deeply interested in the series and I would be quite heartbroken if I can't finish them.",books,405
"Many years ago after I finished reading *The Shadow of the Wind* for the second time, I travelled to Barcelona to experience this beautifully mysterious city first-hand.

Today I finally completed my journey through the *Cemetery of Forgotten Books* series having finished *The Labyrinth of the Spirits* and although I've come across plenty of walking tours in Barcelona which visit locations featured in the first book, I'm eager to find a true fans' tour which visits places featured throughout all four books.

I feel my best bet may be to find a native Barcelonian who's as big Zaf√≥n fan as I am, who may be able to guide me themselves. But I thought I would ask in case anyone else has come across such a thing.

I'm such a devoted fan of these books, but not a single friend, lover or family member has ever read the copies I've gifted them over so many years. So since I've still yet to have an enthusiastic conversation with anyone in the world about Zaf√≥n's books and what they mean to me, I'd happily settle for some kind of real-world appreciation group if anyone knows of anyone who may be able to connect me to something like that.",books,1144
"...isn't it!? 

Obviously this doesn't apply to all great friendships, but over the years this is something I've noticed and come to believe.

1) Lending books is a time-consuming endevor. When you're lending a book to someone, you're essentially demanding a sizeable chunk of that person's time. If you're lending someone a book that takes 8-10 hours to read, I think that's an impressive commitement from that person.

2) There's also an implied commitment just from the act of reaching out to someone for books. If I'm asking someone to borrow me some books that he/she enjoyed, I'm essentially saying *Hey, I like the way you think, let me get on that.* Likewise, lending someone a book shows that a genuine interest in the other person that goes beyond just recommending a show on Netflix. As I mentioned above, you're asking that person to devote a lot of time into something you think he/she would enjoy or benefit from.

3) This probably doesn't apply to most people, but I'll say it anyway - lending books to someone can be pretty anxious. You don't know when you're going to get them back, you don't know in what condition you're going to get them back, and so on. Some people, myself included, are very peculiar about that. So if someone who you know to be picky about that sort of stuff lends you one of their books, you know that your enjoyment of the book is more important to them than the book in its physical form.

Anyway, these are just some of the observations I've made over the years. In my experience, friendships where you lend and borrow each other's book are deeper, and they're a thing to be cherished. Thanks for reading.",books,1649

"i first read this book in 4th grade (i know, definitely not the book for a 4th grader) and only got half way through because i couldn't bring myself to continue. i read it again a few years later and fell in love with it all over again. stephen chbosky's writing style is one of my favorite parts. the way he writes really fits charlie. he also makes the characters really relatable so you can see yourself in each one. 

the book also touches on really important topics, like mental health and abortion. also, it shows how the signs of sexual assault can be so hard to see or notice. the perks brought light to a lot of dark topics and definitely started a conversation. i found myself connecting with charlie who suppressed his trauma from his aunt hellen sexually assaulting him as a child. it made me remember how i suppressed the memory of my own sexual assault until i was older. 

the movie was incredibly well cast. i could not stop crying when i watched it for the first time. i made my friend and boyfriend watched it and they both loved it as well.  it was exactly how i imagined it and was very well made. if you haven't read it yet, i highly suggest that you go pick up a copy! this is a book that i think everyone should read :)",books,1242
"I recently read Gombrich's ""The Story of Art"" and it completely changed the way I see art. I have always loved art but never went deeper, I just liked looking at paintings, sculptures and buildings. Reading the book made me understand that there is something more, that you can get a deeper level of appreciation if you know the context the piece of art was made in and the story that brought to it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am now looking for a comparable work also in the field of literature. I love reading, as you all do, but I feel like I would get more out of what I read knowing what is behind it, what's the story that brought to that level of literature. 

&amp;#x200B;

What do you all think of it? Do you think a book is isolated or can it give a much bigger experience if the reader is aware of the background of the writer and of his/her world? Can you suggest me some book on the history of literature comparable to Gombrich's work?

"Between Justice and Time, it is a masterfully blends genres in this tumultuous, Nazi-hunting thriller. With elements of spycraft and international intrigue, shady secondary characters and potential betrayals, this is a well-rounded peek into the gears of war with a pace that rarely slows.

Also, Nazi-hunting sci-fi thriller....",books,480
"I enjoy reading Russian Literature and Russian History. I find a common thread throughout the literature and history there seems to be a lot of existential dread, and if not dread, a general acceptance of existentialism and sometimes fatalism.

My favorite authors from the Tsarist Era are Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, and Pushkin. Dostoevsky's has more religious content. However, it's notable that in Crime and Punishment, it seems that suffering is necessary for redemption, often quite a lot. 

Tolstoy explores in depth Andrei Nikolayevich Bolkonsky's ongoing search for meaning. He loses any interest in life only to come out of it on his deathbed due to the love of Natasha. Nevertheless, Tolstoy repeatedly discusses fatalism. It was as if God set up domino's and then,  watched them fall.

Pushkin was mainly a poet, but besides love, he explored death and regret for what would have been.

In Russian, ""nichevo"" -pardon the lack cyrillic alphabet- is the response to the equivalent of ""How are you doing?"" It literally means ""nothing.""  I find that interesting. Although, I won't go further with language here.

I think there may be a similar strand in certain periods of German Writing. Obviously, the French had some famous people, who came to start the formal philosophical school of Existentialism. (Sartre, Simone De Beauvoir, Camus.)

I'm curious to learn about other connections to ""existential dread"" that others may have found and any comments on my view on Russian literature.",books,1488
"The story was amazing, the characters made me chuckle and cry and root for them and feel miserable when something happened to them.  It tells the story of the MacIveys navigating life in the early day‚Äôs of Florida.  It starts in 1968 Miami but quickly jumps back to 1868 and begins with Tobias MacIvey, his wife Emma, and their son Zek. They live by hunting raccoon skins, frying up the meat and selling the skins.  By the end of the story what‚Äôs left of the family are wealthy land barons, but that‚Äôs not spoiling anything because you meet Saul MacIvey in the first couple pages and he tells you about that.  It‚Äôs everything in between that is absolutely fascinating, I could barely put this book down.  Has anyone else read this and found it to be a treasure?",books,761
"Everywhere on cliffnotes and spark notes and elsewhere I'm reading up, I find him being described in very negative terms. Ok, him cornering Dunya like he did was a very bad thing, but other than that I feel he was a good guy. Especially, 1000 times better than the POS Luzhin (Pyotr Petrovitch). The only other bad thing I can think about Svidrigailov is how he described to Raskolnikov how he was marrying a child of 16 and how there was nothing wrong in it. But wasn't that just a drunken stupor? He donated money left right and centre, cared for everyone he met and in the end when Dunya denied him, didn't force himself upon her. Ok he wasn't great, but I feel he wasn't all that bad either.

Lately I've been trying to figure out the name of a book I read when I was younger. I vaguely remember a specific scene in the book where a little boy had a dream/ vision of a mutilated bird.

If I choose a book to read then that book gets my full, undivided attention until it's finished. I feel I lose all sense of immersion if I switch to another story. This includes series of books as well. For example, right now I'm in the middle of my annual HP reread and I have other books calling my name, but I can't start one of those until I'm done with HP.

"I noticed when it comes to the print quality of the actual book, german books differ from UK and US books. Let me explain:

In Germany there are basically 3 quality types:

1. Taschenbuch (like a uk/us paperback)
2. Paperback (like a uk/us paperback but with overall better quality and usually a bit more expensive)
3. Hardcover

While hardcovers are probably the same, the german ""Taschenbuch"" is actually more like the uk/us paperback and the german paperback is somewhere inbetween quality wise. Usually a bit larger with thicker pages, maybe more pictures but still with a flexibal cover often with 3D printed letters/elements (if you know what I mean). But I would say even the cheapest german books still have a nicer quality than most uk/us paperbacks. When I ordered some uk/us paperbacks they were usually pretty hard to open, with covers that feel like simple cardboards and sometimes very thin pages.

So here are my questions:

(First of all: My experience is based on a handfull of books so maybe I'm just plain wrong)

1. Has anybody also noticed differences between different qualities in different countries?
2. Is there something in between Paperbacks and Hardcovers on the uk/us book market?

I hope someone knows what I'm talking about because I couldn't find much about it on the internet.",books,1309

On rereading, it might have just pipped Hitchhikers Guide as my favourite book of all time, especially now that I'm old enough to understand more of the themes in it (and generally know more about literature/have further developed my love of magical realism).

"My father has read well over 2,000 books in his lifetime and he said that this book always sticks out to him. If that isn‚Äôt a good enough recommendation, I don‚Äôt know what is!

Now that I have finished it, all I want to do is talk about it, but the only person I know that‚Äôs read it is my dad and I‚Äôd love to get some other opinions. 

##My post will be spoiler free but the comments might not be. 

So over the course of 3 weeks I dove into it, only to be hit by a brick wall of secondhand tragedy. The main character goes through so many emotionally and physically painful experiences, and as a reader, Steakley found a way to make you both witness and experience the moments. I am usually a fast reader, but this book took me a while because I constantly wanted to pick it back up and keep reading, but knew that I was in for an emotionally draining time, and if I was exhausted enough, I would have to put it down. For a bit. 

Steakley has only written two books, Armor being his first, and I think it was surprising to see a unique, but definitely not young style of writing. It sucked me in and was interesting to go back and forth between first and third person whether the part of the book was in Jack‚Äôs time or Felix‚Äôs. 

Personally, I thought part one was the strongest and most impactful part of the book. That alone would be a killer short story/film. The rest of the book was very good, but the ending just didn‚Äôt stick with me as much as I wished/expected it to. The big twist was definitely expected, but not shocking enough to have an impact that lasts further than the pages, unlike some other books, and unlike the other sections of this book!

I could go on but I‚Äôd be surprised if anyone made it this far, haha! If you did and have read the book, I‚Äôm open to discussion in the comments, if you haven‚Äôt read it, I‚Äôd be glad to help you find a way to get a copy because it is definitely worth the read.",books,1921

However, I have also found this genre (is it a genre? Style?

"I had basically given up on Rushdie. His last 3 books since Shalimar the Clown in 2005 up to his last  book The Golden House were uninspiring. It seemed he was getting too old and I swore I wouldnt be tempted by his name again.

But then the reviews came out which were mostly positive. Then he got short-listed for the Booker Prize last year I couldnt resist and gave him one last chance. So glad I did.

I just finished Quichotte and it was amazing. Better than his highly acclaimed Midnight's Children. I will argue the best book he has ever written.

I dont want to give away the story but his discussion of the erosion of modern day values as well as the 2 stories in one were highly engaging. And the ending was just magnificent.

Highly highly recommend going out and finding a copy of this book. It wont disappoint.",books,823
"Kinda spoiler toward the end of my post 

Here it is: 


From a lover of reading books and whatever knowledge I deem wonderful, I was truly immersed. Sprawling, expressive even if it's just really a chronicling, earnest, wholesome, heartfelt and heartbreaking. I still am figuring it out and unfolding the events that happened because the book itself is a layered labrynth full of many stories. 

I am awed and floored by Umberto Eco's playful manner and fat imagination and knowledge. 

It's embarassing to say but at least I'm anonymous so here: I literally hugged the book towards the end  because of the emotions I was feeling when I read this passage: 

""Along the return journey, and afterward at Melk, I spent many, many hours trying to decipher those remains. Often from a word or a surviving image I could recognise what the work had been. When I found, in time, other copies of those books, *I studied them with love ...*

"My goodness what a journey this has been, for years I had avoided seeing the movies because I wanted to read the books first, but never got more than a few pages in cause it just seemed like such a dense read and I was never in the mindset to do it.

I sat down at the beginning of quarantine and finally started reading Fellowship very seriously, making sure I took it slow and read very closely. There were definitely parts of these books that I was more than a little bored throughout, but the parts that grabbed me REALLY grabbed me!

I had to take a good amount of breaks for a few weeks at a time, and once I even thought there was no way I was going to finish just cause it felt like way too big of a feat. So glad I pushed through cause the payoff was IMMENSE! I read the last 150 or so pages in one sitting which was so rare for me with these books. So happy I pushed through and took the time to read them, even with all the lulls I completely understand why they're held in such high regard, and everybody should give them a shot if they haven't!

Also, if you're struggling to get through a long book or series, it's totally okay - put the book down for a little bit, move on to something else, but come back to it. You'll find that a bit of a break is a really good refresher!",books,1289

"I'm still only recently getting into some of the classics but noticed the odd trend of telling a story through a character telling another character the story.

"So, for some basic details, it is a trilogy set in the distant future, where almost everything is managed by a sentient, benevolent AI, death is generally curable, and there is a self managing group of ""Scythes"" who ~~kill~~ glean(more tasteful) out of necessity, each in their own robes, which can be any colour, bar black. The first book follows two main characters as they become scythes, and their progression.

The second book progresses the characters, revealing more along the way, and adding to the plot. More is revealed, and things set up for the amazing 3rd book.(I don't want to reveal much that happens here.)

Finally, in book 3, which is somewhat longer than the others, we see things come together, culminating in a conclusion that the reader was hinted to and given glimpses of along the way. This book is really what did it for me. It brought so much together, concluding it all so well, that I felt I should share. I would recommend this to those who like that distant-yet-familiar future setting, or the power struggles throughout.

So that was really awkward when i found out that book was translated through Icelandic language. U better believe it. Now i want to live there. You would noticed that i mentioned if there was any Icelandics here. And there is the reason. Is Iceland really like that? All these traditions and actual lifestyle? What a book, damn. Full of emotions, mostly happiness - found in simplicity of life, but Iceland came to me with nostalgia and depression anyway. Which isn't a bad thing. I actually like it. Since i read it, i have been dreaming about fishing under cloudy weather, with my grandpa, throughout this constant but beautifully gripping silence. Following old traditions and steps of my origins. But the book itself has a different approach and conclusion. Must read book in my opinion. I can't describe much without spoilers so you better start searching for book. 
It was a real journey for me. If i ever want to lie about my trips, i will describe Iceland veryy presicely.",books,1301

The movie is about a month out and i figured i could try to read the book before i watched the movie but everywhere i look the book is out of stock.. does anyone have any idea why?

I came up with 2 possibilities but im not sure if any of them are likely:

1. Netflix is requiring they postpone any sale of the book until after the movie has been released. (This doesnt seem likely)

2. There was a very limited number of the books printed. ( if this is the case how do you find out how many copies of a book have been printed?)",books,701

"What starts as a story of 4 college buddies trying to make it in the big city quickly turns into the history of one, Jude, who suffered a traumatic childhood which leads to a life of self harm and mistrust. The characters in general are flat; they are all handsome, talented, successful, not funny and are conveniently diverse. Most conflict that arises is quickly resolved with an apology and a smile. All of them are hopelessly devoted to Jude and constantly make sacrifices to try and help him, which he obstinately refuses. We are constantly told of Jude's genius, the various characters success, their adventures around the world, but we are never really shown any of these things. At 800+ pages you would think there is plenty of opportunity for this, but the majority of the book is devoted to describing Jude's self-harming and horrifying childhood. This detailed, fetishistic depiction both bogs down the narrative and can make for an uncomfortable and difficult read due to the subject matter. The hyperbolic prose is riddled with inconsistencies and recurring, bland encounters and dialogue. Despite all of its faults, it is still just intriguing enough to keep on reading. It would benefit greatly from a better editor. For those that struggle with self-harm this novel could be an empathetic outlet, but it also toes the line of romanticizing it. This book would be good for those who want to see how much damage PTSD can wreak on one's life, or if you really enjoy melodramatic tragedies.",books,1502
"Even though it came out 20 years ago, I'd never heard of it.  I recently saw the spine of this book on some bookshelf tours and it was pretty and I googled it and it sounded cool so I bought it.  I have the paperback edition by the way (I referenced some page #s below).

Just finished it and I'm just...  muddled.  I want to talk about the book but I don't know anyone who's read it.  I also don't know anyone I could hand it to and they WOULD read it.  :(  Here are some of my thoughts.  Feel free to answer nothing and to ask more questions, and/or state your opinions on other facets of the book.

I was thinking that Johnny was becoming symptomatic for schizophrenia (and/or having symptoms brought on by the book / house itself) and that was what his mother had, and that was one of the reasons he was an unreliable narrator.  But that still doesn't really explain everything. 

It said that the intro was written by Johnny Oct 31, 1998.  Isn't it weird that it seems lucid, yet the parts at the end of the book leading up to that day and even on that day reveal his complete descent into madness?  I'm assuming that him beating up Gdansk man is a hallucination.  He shows us in the intro that he enjoys telling tall tales, so then I wonder if anything he says is true, and any lies may have nothing to do with him being mentally ill.  

I know some people think Zampano is Johnny's real father (on p. 543, he states ""Perhaps in the margins of darkness, I could create a son who is not missing.""  Dated Sept 21, 1970).  Johnny is born Jun 21, 1971.)  If so, who is the pilot / trucker that Johnny thought was his father?  And also wouldn't Zampano be kind of old to be his father? 

At the end, the portion about the baby (518-521), I'm confused.  I've read some people think that's Johnny and that he died then, and that Zampano made up everything else.  I also read someone's comment that they thought Johnny's mother successfully strangled him and that he doesn't exist and maybe SHE wrote the book.  But if he didn't die as an infant then who is that baby?

I took the letters from his mother to be showing evidence that she was schizophrenic and that all seemed believable, except how did she do the text effects in some of the last letters?  Also she ""lives in the Whale""?  p. 503  (The name of the psych hospital is Whalestoe).  Anyone understand the signficance of that?  I'm weak on Biblical references. 

I have a lot of confusion about the sections at the end of the book.  Page 542-547 (Zampano's diary snippets).  Don't know what to make of that.  Or the reference to the Song of Quesada and Molino which was eliminated.

There's a quote that's repeated - I saw it on p. 546-57 struck out (An old man's mind is just as likely to wander as a young man's...""  I know that was somewhere else in the book, too, and I'm confused on the significance.

The plate on p. 549 (small written text).  I can't read it and was wondering if anyone had taken a magnifying glass to it.  I have one at work so I may try that.  Any thoughts about the plates on pp 550-52?  Who wrote the typewritten portion on p. 552 that considers changing the plot so that Chad and Daisy die?

I don't get the point of the pelican poems (573-580) nor the other poems (558-565).  I thought about typing the poem on page 564 (La Feuille) into Google translate (it's in French and not translated and I don't speak any French) but I haven't done so yet.  Has anyone, or does anyone read French that can give a summary?

Even if I never get the answers to these questions, I think I'm gonna be asking myself for a LONG time if I found a door to an impossible hallway, would I enter or not?  I'd like to think I'm smarter than that and I would have left that house immediately but I kinda think I would have gone in.",books,3795

"Beautifully writ book detailing the bleakness of a life so cut off from society. Even Yozo himself explains what he really sees society as - the individual. 

To say that he is oppressed by a mere lack of social grace is a criminal understatement. He is devoid of human understanding. He could not for the life of him understand ‚Äòwhat makes people tick,‚Äô not least develop an image bearing  the likeliness of a human adequate enough for him to come to any resolve.

Perhaps it is a profound weakness of spirit or something else? Yozo, by virtue of his literal outlier status, is a cynic. Despite incomprehension, he observes among those around a pretense, whether cunning or innocuous, that seems to be representative of generally accepted social conduct. 

Yozo resorts to clowning, not to be loved but in the hopes that his affectations can serve as a smokescreen to the reality of his desolate, frightful soul. 

Eventually, he wins the graces of those around him. This, however, does not atone the abject fear he experiences daily. 

Hence, his downward spiral. His misfortune as a persona non grata. 

What I found interesting especially about Yozo was what seems to be a chronic impostor syndrome-like behavior. A never ending obedience even in the face of others‚Äô suffering. He is drowning in his own unfounded guilt. He can neither possibly stand his ground nor object. It is a passivity devoid of any kind of wilfullness even to the extremely inconsequential. Perhaps the antonym of passivity is passion.",books,1513
"Several years ago I read an amazing series that I want to re-read but I cannot for the life of me remember the title. Hoping someone here can help me out! I only remember random snippets so here is a super scattered hodgepodge of memories from these books:

The main character is a guy who is accepted at a college for some sort of magic - I believe he is poor and it was difficult for him to get in because of this. 
At some point one of his professors (who is kind of crazy and maybe specializes in a super special type of magic?) pushes him off a roof to see if he can fly?
I think there is a homeless girl who lives on the roofs of the college
There is a kind of rival college student who keeps trying to get him thrown out and something involving an inn room and him stealing something from him via magic (or is there a girl involved here?)
He at some point travels to another land (?) where there is a different type of people, maybe elves, and he is learning from them and there is an episode with a dangerous tree and he has to pick a gift or something but then ends up picking nothing and that is the correct choice.

"I think this is a part of each reader's life : that one book that sounds amazing, gets recommended to you a couple of times, basically follows you like a shadow but you never picked it up. Or you did, but then you looked at it's pretty, intriguing cover and put it back. It's maddening, and at the same almost the way it should be. 

Recently the thoughts of my very own That Book have been not letting me rest. For me that's In Search of Lost Time by Proust. I've owned it since I was 12 and began collecting books, know several people that read it and love it, and yet I cannot ever just go read it. Not even quarantine pushed me over the edge, and I don't know if anything will at this point. It feels almost mystical to feel such an ominous certainty about a book I never read, so I thought of asking for more opinions.

"I just finished Nelson Mandela's ""Long Walk to Freedom"". It's not only the best autobiography I've ever read, but it certainly one of the greatest books I've ever read period.

First and foremost, the writing was absolutely incredible. He definitely has a skill for writing beautifully. The book itself reads like a classical fiction novel. The book itself is about 600 or so pages long, but his writing style made it so easy to read that it felt like I went through a 200 page book.

Second, Mr. Mandela's life was just so incredibly sad, yet inspirational at the same time. He completely dedicated his life to ending apartheid, and certainly paid the price for it in many ways that I won't get into right now. But even though he paid a heavy price, and spent 30 years in prison, he still continued the fight to end apartheid and was willing to sacrifice himself in doing so.

It was also incredibly emotional. I rarely have moments where I get emotional about a book, but this book certainly did it. This book was perfect in almost every way. The writing, the story, the inspirational messages, and it is incredibly apt for our world today.

It's a perfect 10/10 and definitely is in my top 10 for sure. I highly recommend it.",books,1228

how do get over reading burnout/boredom?

"I want to preface this by saying that if the idea of ""timshel"" means something to you, I don't think this post needs to affect that. Steinbeck may have fudged the Hebrew, but that doesn't make the concept less meaningful or real ‚Äì‚Äì it just means the origin is East of Eden, not Genesis.

&amp;#x200B;

So like many on this sub, I loved East of Eden ‚Äì‚Äì but as I read, there was one thing that kept pulling me out of the story. The idea of ""timshel"" is such an important and beautiful symbol in the book, but I speak enough Hebrew to know that Steinbeck gets it pretty much totally wrong.

First of all, the word is ""timshol"" and not ""timshel"" ‚Äì‚Äì pronounced like it rhymes with ""team soul."" But more importantly, Lee's definition of ""thou mayest"" isn't really right.

Basically, the verb mashal means rule/reign. In Hebrew, if you want to conjugate a verb into future tense, you have to attach a pronoun to the beginning. So:

yimshol means ""he will rule""

nimshol means ""we will rule""

timshol means ""you will rule""

The ambiguity Lee talks about is only sort of there ‚Äì‚Äì because the most straightforward translation of ""timshol"" would be ""you will rule,"" but its also possible to translate it as ""you shall rule."" Once you translate it as ""you may rule,"" you're inserting your own interpretation a bit. You're making ""timshol"" a little more ambiguous to communicate some uncertainty that you read into the passage, which wouldn't come across with a more literal translation. It's not necessarily wrong, but its probably not how you'd translate ""timshol"" in isolation.

Knowing this made it hard for me to get fully absorbed into the book's discussions about timshel, even though I wanted to ignore the grammar stuff and just embrace Steinbeck's vision while reading. I'd be really interested to know what people think about this, and if anyone else has had an experience like this with another novel! It doesn't have to be with a translation ‚Äì‚Äì just anything that struck you as wrong and made it hard to connect with the novel fully.",books,2033

" Queen Yavara is a somewhat obscure series of erotic novels set on a fantasy, Tolkien-esque land, with a plot and cast more akin to GRRM's style. I just finished reading the over 700.000 words of which the series consists, and I am dying to find someone with whom to discuss it. Since there is way too much to talk about, I am going to be extremely concise and focus only on the main antagonist: Leveria Tiadoa. 

   Leveria is a unique character for me, as she managed to be a truly despicable, hatred inducing villain, while \*simultaneously\* compelling you to root for her. Antagonists can often gain your sympathy through a redemption arc, a tragic backstory or at least a some sort of inner struggle with their own malice. Leveria stands out because she has none of that.

  Leveria's only glimpse at a moral virtue is her love for one of the main characters, Elena, who happens to be a mostly ethical, empathetic individual. Normally, a romance between ""good"" and ""bad"" characters serves as a catalist to either redeem one or corrupt the other, however, both Leveria and Elena somehow manage to muscle through their clashing personalities without being redeemed or corrupted. The author utilizes this relationship alongside the element of surprise to lure you into liking Leveria. At the beginning of the series, she was shown to have no redeemable qualities whatsoever, so, when she fell in love and began showing mercy and selflessness towards Elena, the reader is propped into thinking her Leveria's character is going through a change of heart and begins feeling sympathy for her, especially when the author does such a good job at conveying her emotions. A few pages, later, however, your expections are shattered as Leveria pulls yet another horrific stunt, with no inkling of regret and no attempt to hide who she is from Elena. Even after this dynamic repeats itself several times, and it becomes clear to your rational mind that any hope you might have for her is false, that false hope is just good enough of an execuse to keep your feelings from turning on her permanently.

   Most authors appear to have a problem reconciling bad people with positive features, always trying to link good behaviour with an attempt at redemption or maybe some form of regret. So I adored to experience this refreshing, stark constrast between such an unwaveringly horrible character and  heartfelt love.

   Although the author makes extensive use of this romance to make her appealing, Leveria's own personality also starts to grow on you as the story progresses. Her mind is so twisted, it almost spins 360¬∫ and starts making sense again. Leveria's pragmatic mindset makes even her heinous act look like just necessary steps to achieve her goals. There is a weird ""fairness"" to her worldview, as she doesn't expect any lenience or justice from others. It's all just a game, and everyone is playing to win. Not that she ever tried to justify her actions, but that's how I felt when reading from her perspective.

   The author also makes it easier to look past her transgressions by putting the other character through situations that forces them to make decisions which range from reprehensible to monstrous depending on your point of view. This creates a sort of ""vacuum"" and makes it unclear on whose side you are suppose to be, if any. Leveria ofter sneaked in to fill that vacuum. 

   In the end, I learned my lesson and managed to cultivate a health dose of despise for her, but it was quite a ride to get there.

   If anyone knows of any characters similar to Leveria, I'd love to hear about them in the comments.",books,3625
"After being mesmerized by the excellence of Christian Bale's performance in the film version, I felt compelled to pick up the book to dig deeper into this story. It was crazy.

For some, the extreme gore and graphic scenes may seem gratuitous but it seemed to serve a larger purpose of addressing the despicable nature of the main character. The gory and violent scenes were described in the same excruciating detail as the scenes where Bateman describes the attire worn by him and others or the music he loves. I was utterly disgusted by the  violent scenes but it didn't take away from my interest in the novel as a whole.

The underlying satire of this book was fascinating. The toxicity of 80s yuppie culture coupled with the lack of individuality of the people sent to me a clear message that their lives were meaningless. 

Patrick Bateman. There is so much to unpack with this character I don't even know if I fully understand him. He has this need to conform and maintain a shallow facade while simultaneously trying to stand out by committing horrendous acts. After completing this novel I only have one thing to say about him: he is a tortured soul. 

This book was crazy, over-the-top, descriptive and ambiguous. Epitome of a rollercoaster ride.

"The last couple weeks I've been reading a lot of stuff from the Romantic era, particularly poetry and snippets of Gothic novels. So last night all the reading got mixed together in my brain and I dreamed that I was Mary Shelley and was hanging out with Percy Shelley and Lord Byron in a dark, spooky mansion. We were exploring all the secret passageways and dark, mysterious grounds of the mansion when Lord Byron went missing, We looked for him and finally found him in a room with blood smeared on the walls. He'd been attacked by a vampire and was very pale and quiet. The dream had a great sense of mood and ominous mystery without being actually scary. I really enjoyed it and was sorry to wake up from it.

So anyways, I'd love to read about any interesting dreams you've had about book characters or authors. I love talking about dreams and am sure there must be some pretty crazy literary dreams out there!",books,914
"Queen Yavara is a somewhat obscure series of erotic novels set on a fantasy, Tolkien-esque land, with a George R. R. Martin-esque plot and cast.

*  The boy was around 9 or 10 years old.

"I had a really interesting conversation today about Carol Ann Duffy's ""The World's Wife,"" which is a collection of poems that takes the female subjects of modern and ancient myths and spins them so that they elaborate on the subject matter from the female subject's point of view. 

I had asked the student, a 16 year old female, what she thought of the poems, and her first response was that ""they are really cool. She tells it like it really is."" 

I began to probe a bit more, interested to see what this student, who typically is something of a science sort, not that into literature, thought about the topics and the subject matter. Many of the poems talk about things like sexuality, rape, despair, desire, and objectification, among a number of things. The student had never heard the term ""patriarchy"" before. Which is interesting in that she is a female living in Asia, which has no end of patriarchal world views and which puts kind of some pressure on girls and women in everything from school, workplace and home life. 

Long story short, I found that the student could understand patriarchy, but for some reason could not connect Duffy's poems to the necessity of feminists to deconstruct and prove that the patriarchal world view is limited. I suggested that m maybe the reason for the poems is to correct the error that women's voices and ideals have been made for them, rather than made by them, even for such things as natural and biological as child rearing, sex, and smoking cigarettes out by the general store while playing hooky from school. 

The student's defence was that ""There are plenty of women making decisions, that doesn't mean that they are just obeying a man."" When I suggested that maybe the culture itself, the one where we think we are making female decisions, as females, could itself be gendered male and driven by male ideals rather than our own, she was befuddled. 

Has anyone else had something else similar happen, where students, admittedly young ones, have never thought about the fact that the culture they receive is not the culture they have made, even though they recognise the difference between a lived experience and an experience that conforms to expectation? 

And as for the poetry? I think it's really good. I recommend it.",books,2279
"Like everyone else, I read ""1984"" and ""Animal Farm"" and loved them, a number of years ago. After that, I moved on to other books and didn't bother to check out anything else Orwell wrote despite the fact, that I easily thought Orwell was one of the best writers out there and understood the acclaim he receives. About a month ago, I read Anthony Bourdain's ""Kitchen Confidential"" and absolutely loved it. In his book, he recommends reading Orwell's ""Down and Out in Paris and London"" as it had a huge influence on Bourdain. So I did, and I quickly became hooked on everything else that George Orwell wrote. I read all of Orwell's non-fiction work straight through with ""Down and Out in Paris and London"" onto ""The Road to Wigan Pier"" and finally, ""Homage To Catalonia"" I also checked out a number of essays that he wrote as well. I'm slowly working my way to his other novels that he wrote before ""Animal Farm"" and ""1984"" but just based on what more I have read already, I can tell you that Orwell's other work deserves so much more attention. The vivid presentation of detail that he uses in ""1984"" is just as prevalent in his non-fiction work. I found myself so endeavored in the scenery that he was describing and his thoughts about the situations around him. I will say that a good majority of his political beliefs do shine through pretty bright but it never bothered me. I cannot recommend to you enough that everyone should check out his other work because so much of Orwell's whole career is overshadowed by the success of ""Animal Farm"" and ""1984"" as understanding as to why that it because those books are great, if you find yourself craving more, I can tell you his other work will satisfy.",books,1700

"After having a discussion with a friend over books, they mentioned to me that I had to pick up The Hobbit and read it through. I had a copy since maybe the early 2000s and never once picked it up and read it all the way through. Now of course, many people here might be judging me on that.   
So I finally picked it up and read through the whole story within 2 days. All I will say is...how and why did I even pass this book up?! I only remember reading chapter 1 over and over again in the past. Never got past that and lost interest within the day. But once I tried to get into it this time around, I kept going forward and actually kept saying to myself, ""Just one more chapter before I finish my reading for the day.""

"I‚Äôm re-reading AF for probably the 4th time. I‚Äôve loved this book ever since I realized there was a great deal of unrest in the world and I seem to find something new every time I read it. 

This time, while within the first 2 chapters, I realized how short the animal revolution is. The moment they decide to rise up against Mr Jones, to the time it‚Äôs over, is less than 2 pages. And it made me think about how Orwell wasn‚Äôt, perhaps, interested in the uprising or overthrow. Now granted, the book isn‚Äôt overly long and so how many pages could he dedicate to the moment. But it does seem to suggest to me that uprising, at least as he is describing it, is easy. 

Obviously it‚Äôs not ‚Äúeasy‚Äù in the real world, as often many people die or are permanently harmed in the process, but violence and coups aren‚Äôt really complicated. What‚Äôs complicated is the power vacuum and the confusion that occurs after. It seems to me, Orwell has purposefully kept the uprising short, as to highlight how easy it is to throw fists, but how difficult it is to sort out the aftermath.",books,1065
"In the vast majority of books, the dialogue is actually incredibly unrealistic. Even when casual little particles are added, like a couple ‚Äúlike‚Äùs here and there, the sentences are way too organized and clear to be real. If you look at transcripts of real conversations, people repeat words a ton, cut off sentences and change directions, and add loads of extra filler. So dialogue in books is (mostly) wildly unrealistic.

"I first noticed this with Wilbur Smith, when several of his characters in different books were turned on by seeing a glimpse of a woman's bushy underarm hair.  That was so specific and so unnusual that it gives us an unfortunate insight into what probably turns on old Wilbur.  I just noticed it again with Ken Follett, who has virtually all his male characters turned on by bushy hair, this time of the pubic region.   

I'm sure the same threads can be seen in movie directors.  Polanski infamously has a running thread through his movies of the corruption of innocence, and that's exactly the theme of the crime which sent him on the run.  Woody Allen is another example of the top of my head, but I'm sure there are many more.",books,730
"It took me three of four months to finish my edition of Don Quijote (book one and two). The reading has been a challenge at times (German translation, though one from the nineteenth century) and a delight in some moments. 

The basic premise is known to most readers, I guess: A fifty year old noble man in 17th century Spain gets crazy by reading too many knight novels, calls himself Don Quijote and takes his lazy neighbor Sancho and his old horse Rosinante to live by the code of the wayfaring knights and experience adventure. He meets a plethora of people from all classes of society and what starts as a comedy gets more and more serious and self reflected eventually.

As this book has a high reputation in 'world literature', with the back text even calling Don Quijote ""belonging to the mythical self-consciousness of Europe"" I was a bit puzzled after finally putting it down today. The story is not that complex or even epic, it more seems like a commentary on the society Cervantes lived in. The prose was very 'swole' - if that's how I can put it - and most dialogues not believable to the 21st century reader (meaning that every illiterate sheepherder talks like a poet).

I am sure the fellow readers here on r/books are able to share their perspectives on why 'Don Quijote' is considered a classic and whether that status is still deserved 400 years later. Thank you.",books,1383

"I've been meaning to explore Russian classics lately and decided to read the edition I had of Dostoevsky's short novel collection. I'm 18 and haven't read anything of him before so excitedly dived into it. After finishing each, I wanted to share some of my thoughts.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Gambler**

My first Dostoevsky. Short chapters. Vivid prose and story full of shallow characters losing themselves over money. This novel had the subtle intensity that wouldn't fade. Fairly dark and pretty accessible with humorous undertones in a satiric way. I liked how it heavily emphasized on the weak-willed nature of humans and the dynamics of temptation versus reason.

Also, an appearance from a character of grandmother brings such chaos and fun, because we get to read how she calls out each and every hypocrisy in others, whilst slowly descending into addiction herself. I wanted to read more about Polina and the ending comes closest to what I'd call 'Dostoevsky experience': harsh, unforgiving, yet thought-provoking culmination with a glimpse of irony.

Despite the novels overall pessimistic view on humanity, I liked the experience and enjoyed reading this, but thought it could could have been slightly something more.

3.5

&amp;#x200B;

**Notes from Underground**

This could have been shorter. Personally, I love narrative with '*stream of consciousness*' style, yet, subjectively, couldn't connect with this particular novel. I get what Dostoevsky wanted to (and did) portray, but it all felt too grotesque. The idea of self-deprivation/self-condradiction seems interesting itself, but the protagonist felt unnatural, in a sense that all of his behavior seemed so constant, never changing, always the same, even his thoughts: repetitive and somehow robotic.

Each situation he encountered, I could predict what his actions would be and in result, it felt as if Dostoevsky wrote about an idea of certain traits in a person, rather than a real person. The imagery was practically always gritty and ugly, creating a strong sense of dread. 

Whilst I see, why someone would be affected by this, the constant switch between self-pity and self-righteousness protagonist went through got tiring quickly, basically making the novel a confessional text of a convert narcissist.

I wanted to like this, but in the end, didn't, at all.

Also, for some reason, before reading, I thought the story would be told from a pov of female character (it would have been much interesting??). Overall, didn't/couldn't find anything special or affecting in this one.

&amp;#x200B;

**Poor Folk**

Short epistolary depiction of poverty through letters between two characters. I feel the structure of the novel got repetitive, ultimately both characters wanted a shoulder to cry on and therefore the letters they wrote were mainly complaints about poverty, poor health and economic struggles.

When the section of female characters childhood came up, I thought it would develop into something better, but in the end, the novel felt overdramatic and sappy in a lot of ways. On another note, I loved reading part where Varenka remembers autumn in her childhood, it was written vividly with great intensity. Other than that, meh.

I remember I found the book a couple years back and I remember that it was written by a member of the french/Belgian/Spanish royal family (I think it was a bride from one of the former ones being wed into the latter). This makes sense since all the copies I could fine of it were published in French or Spanish.

"To add to that, I live in Asia and shipping fees almost form a darned third of the price every time I hit the purchase button on Amazon. Because we're not incredibly well-off and I don't have my credit card yet I have to ask for my parents' permission to pay for books I want. Usually, when I ask my parents to buy books the net cost is around 70 USD each time. I ask around twice to three times a year, and for the rest of the more leisurely books I possess, I either find in physical bookstores or through searching for free ebooks.

I have very niche interests (certain historical figures) and currently the books containing the information I'd like - a translation of essays written by a classical composer - are unavailable on all the legal and illegal archiving sites I've exhausted in the past. Many books I've read online in the past are only available in Europe with around two to three copies physically intact in national archives, and my local bookstores, needless to say, do not even come close to having those books in their collection. 

Recently, I found what I want on Amazon, but the series I want is sold at an extraordinarily expensive price. I calculated the total cost for all the volumes in the series of essays I find interesting, and they cost over 300 USD. Holy smokes, that's more expensive than a year's worth of textbooks at my school.

It takes a lot for me to ask my parents to get me something. *S*ince I was a kid the I always had a rather strained relationship with my parents, especially my mother, who could get emotionally abusive and led me to a near suicide attempt. I don't ask for a lot and I don't have a lot of material possessions, except for books, which I buy through using my own money I saved from skipping lunch. Since the stuff I just found are so darned costly I don't want to be an entitled prick demanding boatloads of cash to be dumped for my sake. I'd much prefer if there was a cheaper alternative.

Are there any other bookselling websites that allow for international shipping, are highly reliable and still functioning in COVID? I checked websites like Barnes and Noble and from what I interpreted I know international shipping isn't working at this time, so that seller is out of the question. But I could look for others. Preferably it would be a seller that has in their stock niche and specialist book titles.

Any suggestions would be welcome xx",books,2409

"I am a 17 year old high school student, and I've been recently reading more books. Before, I had been reading stuff like manga and novels written by mediocre writers because they were intriguing. I could read up to 10 hours a day without eating and barely just going to bathroom maybe once or twice. In other words, I think I like to read. Problem is, I don't have the same feeling for books. 200 pages look daunting, and the mere thought of spending an hour or so reading 30 pages just makes it all more boring.(my reading speed in 240-250WPM but I read for a lot of comprehension by looking up unknown vocabulary). 

Many of you seem to read a lot and have good reading habits. I just don't know what they are or a pattern I'm not seeing. Would anyone share me their reading habits? I would really love to read more and increase my reading speed to above 300 WPM before college next year.

"I am a 77-year-old grandpa sitting on my deathbed, trying to win the battle against the COVID-19 Virus. A few minutes ago, my 15-year-old grandson came up to me and asked me if I had heard of Reddit. Of course I had heard, I just never created an account. Finally, I created an account just to write this post. He says, ""grandpa, post one thing on Reddit that meant a lot to you during your lifetime.""

How Lord of the Rings had a great deal of effect on me. I was born in Glasgow, Scotland, 1943, I am writing this post from a hospital in the same city! I had always been fascinated with literature, but I never found the 'perfect series' until 1954. I was 11 then. My friend had told me about something called the *Fellowship of the Ring*, the first book out of three which was to be released in the summer of 1954. I had never heard of it, but then I realized he was talking about the sequel of T*he Hobbit.* During the months before it was released (May to July, '54), many of my schoolmates have been chatting about the book. In August 1954, I finally got my hands on *Fellowship of the Ring.*

The first page I had turned, I couldn't take my eyes off of it. It took me a good three weeks to understand the entire Middle Earth universe. I fell in love with the fine-written plot, the well-written characters, and most importantly, the setting, which is a creation of genius!

I got real excited when I had found out the second book would be released in autumn of the same year. In December 1954, I finally got *Two Towers*. This was the best yet! When I put down (finished) the book 2 weeks later, I asked myself if I wanted to be a writer. Then, in '55, book 3 came out. At the last page, I teared up quite a bit as I knew that no more books would be released. However, the question about whether I should be a writer was still engraved in my head.

Although there was a chance that he might not reply, I decided to write a letter to JRR Tolkien. During my two paragraphs, I stated how Lord of the Rings is unique and the finest piece of work I've ever laid my eyes on. I praised him too much to the point where I began to run out of adjectives! I wondered whether there will be a radio or film adaptation. I asked him about his opinion about me becoming an author.

Two months later, Spring 1956, I got a reply from the genius himself. I was extremely shocked that the great professor took the time to reply to my message. Unfortunately, nutter 20-year-old me lost the actual letter in the mid-'60s. But I will jot down some bits I recall, in a more simplified tone:

*""Dear Mr. Cook,*

*- I have received loads of messages in the last few months, I do not always reply, but this one was impossible to put down*

\- *You are a really kind gentleman, but I do not wish for you to flatter me with these words. I am always looking for improvement and feedback, but all you've given me was praise.*

\- *Your question about whether you should become a writer is your decision. You shall work hard and have the tolerance of criticism. A writer does not ask 'Yes or No' questions. Ask more intelligent questions that require a good deal of thought""*

This summarizes the letter. It had a great impact on myself as I began to find my path. I did find my path. I became an English teacher at the age of 23 and began teaching children about the important aspects of the subject. From 1966 to 1998, I had been an English/Literacy/History/Geography teacher. I had served as Deputy Headmaster from 1998 until I retired in 2008. All of this seems irrelevant, but what it really means is that Tolkien encouraged me to work hard and not quit. He told me to accept feedback and balance between praise and criticism. In a way, he thought me about the values of life.

In the school I had thought in, I spread the works of Tolkien to my students. I encouraged them to read the great trilogy, as it thought them lots of amazing things. I told them that everyone needs to read Lord of the Rings. Even when kids started using smartphones (Blackberries, Sony, etc.) I forced them to dive into the amazing works. Some of my pupils found it boring, others found it fascinating. But I told them that everyone must admire the great piece of literature.

In my entire lifetime, I have read the Lord of the Rings trilogy 17 times, and watched the faithful movie adaptations thrice. Remember, I created this Reddit account just to express my thoughts on something that means a lot to me. I want to tell the world my story before I pass on. The doctor told me I have a 20% chance of living.

That's my reflection on my entire life.

The inspiring, complex, breathtakingly beautiful bestseller that is Lord of the Rings.",books,4696
"Has anyone read this book and really liked it? I have yet to meet anyone who had read it. I just enjoy the story, the mysterious items mentioned in the book, the fake locations and fake sports teams names. 

The characters travel to different dimensions and planets, read obscure books, but are relatable in their day to day lives. Leonard (the protagonist) always feels like a loser or ostracized (which most of us can relate to), but manages to save a race of people from some interdimensional villains.",books,505
"I don't know why but the description of teenagers in the book really put me off, I mean I get that it's a fantasy book but I am really finding it hard to believe that the characters are teens maybe it's to do with how they behave?

"The Great Gatsby. Dracula. Pride and Prejudice. I can‚Äôt finish books that have an air of sophistication around them, or unusual vocabulary that isn‚Äôt used very much nowadays. I feel pretty dumb when I‚Äôm reading an H.G. Wells book and I‚Äôm rereading sentences to understand exactly what the characters are saying or doing. I‚Äôm looking up definitions of words so that I‚Äôm truly understanding the scenario as well. 

It‚Äôs as if my brain just stops and can‚Äôt process what I‚Äôm reading. I have to pause and manually think about what the writer is trying to convey instead of letting the writer build the fictional world for me. It makes it impossible to become engrossed in these novels and I get so tired or frustrated that I have to put the book down.

Do I just have a sluggish rate of comprehension compared to others? Do I need to find books of an easier level before attempting classics?",books,886
"We all know live-action usually don't do well when adapting books but I really think maybe animations could do it some justice. 

I think because books rely solely on the readers imagination, when interpreted into a live-action it looses its charm and appeal which is why it is dismissed so often. Unless if there's a huge budget, the product probably won't be what the consumers want.

Cartoons however also play mostly off of the viewers imagination. With all the wacky scenarios that could be emulation in animations that would be flat out weird in live action, cartoons are able to pull off more diverse situations. This is why I think it may succeed in adapting books.",books,673

"I love reading books, I love them all but for some reason I just hate romance books. 
It might be to do something with that I completed college this year and yet not have been in any kind of relationship or it mught be something else.

"Hello everyone,

Mind you, I'm not an avid reader. However, the more I read (specifically novels, 'cause I'm also a student of essays and such), the more I realise how quickly I forget what I read. What I mean with that is that I don't remember the specifics of what I read, the words and such. I trade those words with feelings and emotions that are as vague as they're flaky. Most of all, I hate that I can't quite convey what I felt like and, even, what caused that feeling when I try to explain what a book was like to a friend. It makes me feel like I truly wasted my time.

To all avid readers, how do you actually read? Do you take notes, do you write down interesting passages, do you actually learn by heart whole pages and review them every once in a while so that you don't forget them, or do you just remember much better than I do without doing anything special?

Cheers!",books,884

"I didn't know I liked reading for a VERY long time. I found out through being in Honors English, and being forced to read, that I enjoy reading. Problem is, I am very picky. I need a book that, from the beginning, will change my view on the world. If it starts to get heavy too late in the book, I've probably already dropped it.   
Sometimes, for a bedtime read, I like books that over explain and paint such a vivid picture. These books may not have the heavy subject material I enjoy, but I enjoy the writing style so much because I can see the story play out. I normally can't imagine things, even to a point were I'd say I dream like a blind person. Nothing but voices. Books that over explain but have a beautiful writing style are my only way to see things that aren't there.  
If you know of a book that does both of these things, I'd love to hear about it. If you know of a book that does just one of these things, tell me and just explain which category it fits under.",books,978
"I love The Fault In Our Stars by John Green.

I am a sucker for good quotes, and John Green is especially good at coming up with them. He hits on so many questions we have about life. 

For example, he touches upon existential questions, i.e. being remembered after death and the meaning/purpose of life. 

*‚ÄùThere will come a time when all of us are dead. All of us. There will come a time when there are no human beings remaining to remember that anyone ever existed or that our species ever did anything. There will be no one left to remember Aristotle or Cleopatra, let alone you. Everything that we did and built and wrote and thought and discovered will be forgotten and all of this will have been for naught. Maybe that time is coming soon and maybe it is millions of years away, but even if we survive the collapse of our sun, we will not survive forever. There was time before organisms experienced consciousness, and there will be time after. And if the inevitability of human oblivion worries you, I encourage you to ignore it. God knows that‚Äôs what everyone else does.‚Äù* 


*‚ÄùSome people don't understand the promises they're making when they make them,"" I said.

""Right, of course. But you keep the promise anyway. That's what love is. Love is keeping the promise anyway..‚Äù* 


*‚ÄùThere are infinite numbers between 0 and 1. There's .1 and .12 and .112 and an infinite collection of others. Of course, there is a bigger infinite set of numbers between 0 and 2, or between 0 and a million. Some infinities are bigger than other infinities. A writer we used to like taught us that. There are days, many of them, when I resent the size of my unbounded set. I want more numbers than I'm likely to get, and God, I want more numbers for Augustus Waters than he got. But, Gus, my love, I cannot tell you how thankful I am for our little infinity. I wouldn't trade it for the world. You gave me a forever within the numbered days, and I'm grateful.‚Äù*

Absolutely beautiful quotes. 
But let‚Äôs not forget about this gem:

*‚ÄùWhat a sl*t time is. She screws everybody.‚Äù*

I also love/hate the fact that it is one of the few books to not have a ‚Äòfairy-tale‚Äô ending. It is more representative of how life actually is- harsh and unforgiving. It reminds us that not everything has a happy ending and that tragedy may be inevitable, but that we can always find hope.",books,2361
"I listen to audiobooks while I run and I‚Äôve just finished my most recent series. I‚Äôm looking for suggestions for books that are relatively fast paced, fiction, preferably sci fi, fantasy, historical fiction, dystopian.

"Being that I don‚Äôt real a ton of fiction, I have noticed a pattern in these books and was wondering if it was a common style. 

Without fail (I‚Äôve read 10 of them) this seems to be the formula. 30-50 pages of character intro, final 30-50 are explosive climate where all the characters finally clash. Everything in between is basically just chAracter building etc.

"I didn't really expect get as deep into this book as I did. It's one of the first ones I've tried to read for run (after years-long hiatus), and was definitely not something I'd usually read. The few books I usually read are mostly in the self-help / scientific nonfiction category, and the fact that it was a memoir almost put me off it (High School flashbacks), I originally downloaded it because I wanted to learn more about her crazy hillbilly dad.

The way she writes was almost too flowery for me to start with, but I guess it's more of the fact that I don't read a lot of memoirs that describe people and feelings in general (plus the fact she's written so many papers on philosophy lol). I found it works really well for the things in the book: her brother's volatile temper, the tense interactions between family and her internal flip-flops between her family and her new identity.

Great book, haven't gotten this into reading in a while, would appreciate recommendations for more like it.",books,999
"I cannot stand it when authors write books set in the Victorian Era, but give the characters modern ideas and morals. To me it comes across so fake.

Most of the time I don‚Äôt even get why the author brings these things up because they usually aren‚Äôt very relevant to the story.

"Hi, its about 2:30ish in the morning. I finished Crooked House by Agatha Christie about an hour ago, and I just wanna talk some more about it.

I love mystery and thriller and anything of the likes really. But I'm not an avid reader, which i hate. My reading ruts last long, and everytime i try to change it i read about four books and then i go back again. Same happened this time. I havent read a book since April I'd say. And at the beginning of this year i read 'And then there were none' by Agatha too. That book got me hooked, which led to me reading another 6. So i thought, why not try it again? My goal for this year is to read 20 books, and i'm only halfway, so Agatha might help. And as i expected, it did.

Honestly, i just love her work. I've only read 4 of her books. The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, Murder on the Orient Express, And then there were none and now Crooked House. My favorite has got to be 'and then there were none', but that's a story for another day.

The moment i started reading, i had this thought, which might not be correct since i haven't read much of her work, but nevertheless: she always placed the murder in a closed place where anyone and no one at the same time could be the suspect. Now, since the very beginning, i had my doubts on who could actually be the murderer. Mostly depending on what I've read so far. But the thing that left me wondering was that none of the actual residents had a motive to kill. And as much as i wanted to make it make sense, it just seemed absurd. I would go through all of the characters, and consider even the least vague thing about their personalities to be a reason of why they could be potential suspects. None of them had a good alibi so that wasn't helping. All of them were somewhat peculiar and queer, with very suspicious demeanors and just were too wary during the police interrogations. Which is normal of course, but still weird to me. Now i considered that this was all a doing of the extremely cautious old man, but I couldn't come up with a decent reason as to why he would do it. And i even suspected his dearest one. What i knew though, was that this was no easy case. 

And it indeed wasn't. I honestly am very pleased with the ending. Though a bit grim, i honestly couldn't have thought of a better ending myself. I have to accept that it took me by surprise and that the actual murderer was the one i least suspected. I'm still very astounded and just honestly happy that i got this book.

"So, I finally read Tiger Lily by Jodi Lynn Anderson and I am devastated in the way only a book that touches your soul can leave you. For context, the original Peter Pan by James Barrie is one of my favourite all-time books and I know that fans of the original don't usually enjoy Tiger Lily. I loved it. I was able to separate it somewhat from my prior conceptions of Peter Pan and was truly immersed in the world that Anderson created. I'm also a full blown adult and at no point felt like I was reading a YA story. 

The characters were complex and evoked such intense emotions in me while I was reading. At different times throughout the book I loved, hated, and cried for each individual character. Anderson's Peter Pan is still true to the spirit of the Peter we remember but in a more mature and familiar sense. As a reader, you truly fall in love with him as Tiger Lily does which makes his betrayal personal in a sense. Tiger Lily is fierce and yet so vulnerable and seeing it all through Tink's eyes was wonderful for me. I found the historical links to colonization and conversion added further depth to the story and pushed the plot forward in a masterful way. This is so much more than a love story between Tiger Lily and Peter Pan - it's a story of belonging and community and heartbreak and loss and childhood and oppression and so, so much more.

"I have finally found the the reason I never could really get into books, because I never actually read or have someone tell me something about a book that would pick my interest or fascinate me. Usually with anime, movies, games or manga/comics you can see a pic of it and get interested, or stumble over a scene of it on youtube or maybe see some memes of it. With books that never happens. The only book I've gotten out of pure intrigue was Roadside Picnic because I played Stalker and watched the movie and wanted how is the thing that inspired these two.

I tried searching for some booktubers that do analytical content (they type where they talk about the theme, ideas or cinematography rather than plain reviews) and watch a video of them of a book and see if it interests me but I didn't really find any. I really liked Pewd's book vids and the way he talked about them.

Howard, ""Genseric's Son"", which he quickly recognised as having strong possibilities if completed not by one, but a whole series of authors.
&gt; 
&gt; Beginning with Fantasy Crossroads in March 1977 Bacon lined up top authors in the fantasy field to each contribute a chapter until the novel would be completed some 17 installments later. Each issue of Fantasy Crossroads would include two or three chapters until the saga was finished. Unfortunately, thouh, after on 12 chapters saw print with the January 1979 issue, Fantasy Crossroads was no more, and for all intents and purposes, Ghor, Kin-Slayer was lost forever.

 - Publisher's Note, *Ghor, King-Slayer* (1997), 176

""Doom of the Thrice-Cursed"" is the sixteenth and penultimate chapter in the saga of Ghor, the round-robin which began with an incomplete story by Robert E. Howard and in time included some of the most prominent names in fantasy and horror‚Äîincluding Karl Edward Wagner, Michael Moorcock, Manly Wade Wellman, Brian Lumley, Frank Belknap Long, Ramsey Campbell, and many others. The only black author was Charles R. Saunders. The only woman was Marion Zimmer Bradley.

Marion Zimmer Bradley had been involved with science fiction &amp; fantasy fandom since the mid-late 1940s, claimed to have met her first husband through the letters pages of *Planet Stories*, and by the mid-1950s was a published author in her own right, and found particular success in her Darkover series, a science-fantasy sword &amp; sorcery world that takes its inspiration, and some of its names, from Robert W. Chamber's *The King in Yellow* (1895), as well as from J. R. R. Tolkien's *The Lord of the Rings* (1955). She was also published in *Amra*, one of the premier Robert E. Howard 'zines of the 1960s, and became one of the most outspoken and well-known women in science fiction and fantasy, and much of her most popular and celebrated work involved female protagonists and a focus on their points of view and concerns‚Äîa rarity in male-dominated fantasy and sword &amp; sorcery at the time. After Ghor, Kin-Slayer, she would go on to edit the long-running Sword and Sorceress anthology series, and find international acclaim with *The Mists of Avalon* (1983).

The story up until the point that Bradley received it was, like many round-robins, not well-balanced in terms of plot and pacing. Ghor had begun as a James Allison tale;  Howard had written several tales with Allison, most notably ""The Valley of the Worm"" (*Weird Tales* Feb 1934) and ""The Garden of Fear"" (*Marvel Tales* Jul-Aug 1934). In each of these stories, the crippled Allison in the present day would cast back his mind into previous, more heroic incarnations, to relive the glories of past lives and loves. This literary device allowed Howard to explore different fantasy historical periods and settings‚Äîin this case, Howard set the stage of Ghor's adventures in Vanaheim and Asgard, and so implicitly in the Hyborian Age, making Ghor a contemporary (of sorts) with Conan the Cimmerian.

Whatever initial plot Howard had in mind and never finished, in the hands of other fantasy writers, the Ghor saga got properly weird; involving as it does the Cthulhu Mythos, a prophecy, losing a limb and gaining a magical prosthetic (a la Lludd of the Silver Hand), becoming a werewolf, and gaining an affinity with the Hounds of Tindalos. Old pulpster H. Warner Munn left off the previous chapter with Ghor leaving the Caves of Stygia...

&gt; Out of the caves of Stygia, then, with the great river Styx bursting forth at our feet and across the desert; Shanara, still unconscious against my breast, and at my feels the dread Hounds, invisible, only a rustling and a panting and a fleeting brush against my thigh. On, Northward through the night, drawn by the northern stars that flickered cold above us; but even the giant strength that I, James Allison, wielded in those nigh-forgotten days when I was Ghor, kin-slayer and great were-wolf, was waning.

 - Marion Zimmer Bradley, *Ghor, Kin-Slayer* (1997), 152

Despite this being the penultimate chapter, it is really in many ways the wrap-up of the whole preceding saga; Richard Lupoff, who got chapter 17, offers something more along the lines of a postscript or epilogue. So Bradley's 11-page chapter is, in essence, a short story in itself trying to bring about a satisfying conclusion to whatever threads are left‚Äîprincipally, the three curses Ghor had accumulated‚Äîstarting with:

&gt; [...] Shanara had probably been less than faithful wife to me. Well, I thought, looking at her haggard, ravaged features, for that too she had paid. And indeed in such a world as this, a woman had no choice but to obey whoever held her body; she had become my bride by no less forceful process, and that we had come to love one another was only a single blessing showered on me amid many curses. No; I would not ask Shanara what price she had had to pay for surviving the long ordeals of capture. (ibid. 153)

If the tone seems reminiscent of [‚ÄúThe Vale of Lost Women‚Äù](http://deepcuts.blog/2020/06/10/the-vale-of-lost-women1967-by-robert-e-howard/) (1967) by Robert E. Howard, it should be remembered that this bit of casual sexism is being filtered through a female fantasy writer, and Bradley is neither entirely unsympathetic to Shanara nor does she ignore the physical and psychological impact of the implied rape. Which includes one of the oldest tropes of body horror, well-familiar to Mythos fans:

&gt; For her body was swelling, ripening...and I knew that look. Even her sullenness and the persistent thirst was part of that, and it was not hunger alone set her to seeking the bitter desert herbs as we travelled. Within her breeding body the curse of Gaea was ripening. (ibid. 154)

There is a question of who is the father; and Ghor entertains that it might be his, the sorcerer who kidnapped her, or even ""some nameless thing somewhere in the realms of sorcery and evil"" (ibid). Ironically, Ghor has no real issues if the child isn't his; the wild-man's own family situation being what it was (exposed at birth as an act of infanticide, raised by wolves, killing his own birth-family), he is rather progressive in his determination to adopt Shanara's kid.

The story skips forward to the birth, and then to the final fulfillment of the curse. Ghor's story comes full-circle.

In one sense, Bradley had her hands tied: fifteen chapters of increasingly odd sword &amp; sorcery, bringing in everything from the Moorcockian Gods of Law and Chaos to the Cthulhu Mythos‚Äîand there were prophecies and curses to wrap up, physical distances to travel to get Ghor back from Stygia to Nemedia and finally in the icy forests where the story started under Robert E. Howard. In another sense, by putting the focus on Shanara and the goddesses who cursed Ghor, by addressing the sexism and realities of sex and family in the Hyborian Age, she makes the chapter her own.

It's not a bad penultimate chapter by any means. Not something Robert E. Howard was likely to write, but then nothing that any of the other authors had contributed attempted to really pastiche Howard; they all knew better than to try and ape his prose, and they all brought their own ideas to the table while trying to keep the story moving. For fans in 1997 when this was published for the first time, they could likely appreciate that.

Today, readings of Bradley's fiction tend to be colored by other factors in her life.

Walter Breen was prominent in Darkover fandom. Breen had been convicted of child molestation in 1954 and received a suspended sentence; his continued pederastic activities resulted in his banning from the 1963 Second Sci-Fi Pacificon. This caused an uproar in fandom, with Marion Zimmer Bradley vocal in her defense of Breen, though the actual cause of Breen's banning was not universally known, and was called the [""Boondoggle.""](https://breendoggle.fandom.com/wiki/Breendoggle_Wiki) Breen and Bradley would marry in 1964.

In a [1998 deposition](https://deirdre.net/marion-zimmer-bradley-1998-depositions/), Bradley said she was aware of Breen's pedophilia and child molestation. They would separate in 1979, although Breen would continue to live on the same street and in Bradley's employ for the next decade; they would get divorced in 1990. In 1991 he would be sentenced for child molestation, and die in prison in 1994. In 2014, her daughter Moira Greyland came forward to admit that [Marion Zimmer Bradley herself had molested children](https://www.webcitation.org/6RqZ6c9az), including her own children. Links to further accounts, and the story as it unfolded, can be read [here](https://fanlore.org/wiki/Marion_Zimmer_Bradley#Allegations:_MZB_Sexually_and_Physically_Abused_Her_Children).

The personal accounts of Marion Zimmer Bradley both as a serial child sex abuser, and as someone that facilitated Breen's sexual molestation of children, cast a shadow on her fiction. Readers now look for any evidence of predilections which were perhaps not obvious to fans previously‚Äîand there are definitely scenes and relationships in Bradley's work which, in light of these allegations, appear much more skeevy than perhaps they once were.

How do we read ""Doom of the Thrice-Cursed,"" through this lens? There are, fortunately, no incidents of child sexuality in this story. But the revelation of Bradley's history of sexual abuse, and her marriage to Breen‚Äîhow does that reflect on Ghor's oddly accepting attitudes with regard to Shanara's pregnancy? Is he actually being weirdly progressive in not caring if the child is his, and supportive of Shanara despite the social ramifications of rape in Hyborian culture‚Äîis it at all reflective of Breen and Bradley explicitly condoning and supporting each other in their own extramarital sexual relationships?

There are no good answers for these questions. Many folks, reading this story, would be glad not to have been aware of it at all. In 1967, Roland Barthes published the essay ""La mort de l'auteur,"" which would have strong and wide-ranging impact on literary criticism. With the death of the author, authorial intent needs no longer be a primary concern of literary criticism; the text can be read and interpreted on its own, apart from the facts of the author's own life.

A straight reading of the text, with no knowledge of the author, would almost certainly not raise any associations with pedophilia in the reader's mind. If you take Bradley out of the equation, then ""Doom of the Thrice-Cursed"" becomes little more than a chapter in a long but not-terribly-great Robert E. Howard fanfiction. The comments on sexism and the Hyborian Age remain, and the story can be ready, studied, critiqued, and enjoyed.

Yet...it is important that Marion Zimmer Bradley was the author, the only female author, in this round-robin. That she choose to address sexism in the Hyborian Age, or at least Ghor's understanding of it, becomes important‚Äîbecause her male contemporaries in Sword &amp; Sorcery largely didn't. If you as a reader or critic consider sexism and gender disparity in the field of fantasy fiction important at all, then her presence, as more than mere tokenism, has to count for something.

Marion Zimmer Bradley inspired many. She injured many too.

Marion Zimmer Bradley also wrote a novel with Mythos elements, *Witch Hill* (1990).

"Over the last few months of lockdowns and shop closings, I've found myself buying books in electronic format a few times. It's been a transition, reading from a tablet. The convenience of buying something online and having it immediately available to read without having to brave (or avoid) crowds or wait for shipping has been a new experience for me the last few months.

And yet, I still find myself preferring physical paper books. It's been more than preference for reading from a physical book, often decades old and owned by many before me. The accumulation of a bookshelf (or, increasingly, many bookcases) of books has been an experience of collecting books, remembering the times of finding an old edition buried in a used bookshelf or buying a book in a remote place on a long-ago vacation.

"Hi! I am a native Spanish speaker with a degree on Spanish (Philology/Literature/Linguistics depending on your country) and I am very fond in reading texts in its own language.

"This is the first Dostoevsky book I've read. 

I wish to share some thoughts I had while reading this.

1. Narrator claims at one point he began speaking because he wanted to find whether other people also get a pleasure by too vivid a consciousness of their own humiliation, when one reaches at the end of self reflection knowing one is who he is because it is the way of the natural order. 

My question is does a human really feel a sense of pleasure in that? Or is something only underground man can feel? He tries to explain this precise pleasure through out the first part but I couldn't grasp it. Does he include one of his experience for this kind of suffering in the second part of the book.

There are pleasures in other kinds of despair that I can understand with the examples he given in the second part. Like when someone having a toothache he tries to share the despair with others. This is shown very well when the narrator get humiliated by his friends he puts the same humiliation on Liza. (But I couldn't find examples for the above mentioned suffering in the second part)

2. He claims that when he performs inappropriate actions he is aware of the polar negatives of those actions: noble actions. Yet he carries on doing and ends up being believing that it's his normal condition. So he has defined a  condition for him which contradicts with his previous claim that he is not even an insect. Does it really contradicts his previous claim? Or is there something I haven't understood in this claim?

3. When he says that simple truth ""you are what you are"" is due to the laws of nature, what laws does he talk about? Are we what we are because that's how we are made or is it because of free will that's what we have choosed to be in this world? 

If it is the first condition then agian his next talk about free will contradicts this condition where we simply acts as we do because that's what we are.

4. Underground man then goes rambling about his  famous argument that an utopia created by guidances isn't possible because man is unpredictable due to his free will. While I agree that Dostoevsky has created a fine argument against the theory of this specific utopia here's some thoughts that crossed my mind. 


If the utopia can give rise to those who sabotage it and those who will give up luxuries of the utopia to be free can we think about the unspoken counter argument? In the realistic world where the utopia is far from reach and from the words of underground man himself where blood and suffering flowe freely we can be free to be otherwise. If we want we can not be scoundrels and be beautiful and lofty. 
Is this what Dotovosky (not underground man) hints at?


And another thought I had is whether this argument is an answer for the question which every witty atheist asks from devout Christians? If God is merciful and all powerful why is there suffering in this world? Is it to grant us free will?



There's much I haven't grasped from my first reading of a book by Dostoevsky. (Whenever I feel I'm getting a grasp at something it slips away.) Eager to continue reading other of his works.",books,3129

Although the critics really panned it, I really enjoyed this book. Eggers can be a little hit and miss for me, but I thought it had some really compelling characters. I think the critics viewed it as a political novel or some kind of societal commentary, whereas it seemed like a very personal, character based novel to me. The plot seems kind of like a bad joke - a man kidnaps an astronaut, a senator, his high school teacher, his mother and his crush to ask them questions.

"I decided to pick up this book because my favorite author, GRRM, recommended it in one of his videos.

He's basically a far less interesting Eric Cartman in a solo act with no other characters to bounce his actions off of to get an interesting reaction to form a... how do you say... plot. 

And that's the biggest problem. It has no plot. Just episodic anecdotes of him being somewhat of a prick in a not-so-inspired way. All other characters are not worthy of being called characters, they're just the receiving ends of his douchebaggery.

"I used to read a book in high school and I never got to finish it. I forgot the title, I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs a Stephen King book. At the start it would jump different perspectives like one was about a hunter in the woods and how he found a strange creature and then it would jump to a hit man that‚Äôs doing jobs to finally a kid. I would like to finish the book so any help is great.",books,381
"I was very pleasently suprised by the book, my father, who is an avid reader and book collector, recommended it to me when i had told him id been reading some dystopian novels. 

The book grabbed ahold of me from the beginning, which to be fair was kind of slow, but still very interesting. But the book grew to be an experience about what people can and will do when you take something away that they rely heavily on. I was especially impressed with the way Saramago portrayed the group of people with the gun in quarantine.

Overall it was a great book that i couldnt stop thinking about untill i finished it.",books,611
"I just finished reading *Stoner* by John Williams and it feels like I took a bat to the gut.

&amp;#x200B;

I have not read a whole lot of books these past couple of years. *Stoner* came out of left field and just leveled me. I read this book in about 2 days. I cannot remember having such visceral feelings while reading a book.

&amp;#x200B;

The timidity of Stoner's journey to University life after the simple farm life he was used to. The guilt at telling his parents he would not be returning to the farm.

The discovery of a love for literature while reading Shakespeare in Mr. Sloane's class. The surreal sensation Stoner felt as Shakespeare's sonnet took on actual meaning, not just words to be memorized. 

The awkwardness of Stoner's first ""love"", courtship, and eventual marriage. The absolute horror as Edith became some sort of nightmare wife, and the frustration as Stoner takes no action towards the situation. 

The deep breath of relief we take when Edith leaves Stoner and Grace for a while. Feeling the love Stoner has for Grace during this period, and how Edith comes back and tears it apart.

Even more frustration as Stoner fights Lomax over office politics, both fighting for the ideal University.

The happiness as Stoner finally experiences carefree young love with Katherine Driscoll. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is not a book about big sweeping events. This is the story of one man and his life. We experience his triumphs, his frustrations, his sadness. One can be happy for Stoner as he has his victories and successes. One can be frustrated as Stoner sits and lets horrible things be done to him. In the end, it is Stoner's life and his alone. 

Who are we to judge? Which one of us doesn't have some regrets in our life? I think that is what makes *Stoner* so poignant. We see his life in the span of 280-odd pages. We feel more acutely the direct consequences of whatever actions he takes. The consequences of our own actions are not typically felt until later down the line. 

The ending is particularly rough. As Stoner ""...contemplated the failure that his life must appear to be."" 

He wanted friendship and he had two friends. One died when he was a young man and the other had become withdrawn.

He wanted the singleness and passion of marriage. His marriage was broken and destructive, leading to the broken lives of 3 people. 

He had wanted love, and he had it. But he had let it go.

He had wanted to be a teacher, a good teacher. But he knew he had been an indifferent teacher for most of his life. 

He had dreamed of integrity and purity in his University. Instead, compromise and triviality were the reality.

He had wanted wisdom, but at his deathbed, he found ignorance.

&amp;#x200B;

""What did you expect? he asked himself.""

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe that was Stoner's downfall, or character flaw. No direct, clear cut goal in mind for his life. And in the end, life passed him by.",books,2920
"Pretty self-explanatory but I‚Äôm looking for stuff I could go through in one sitting.

So far I‚Äòve got ¬´¬†Narcissus &amp; Goldmund¬†¬ª, ¬´¬†Sidartha¬†¬ª, ¬´¬†Ishmael¬†¬ª and ¬´¬†Slaughterhouse Five¬†¬ª. 

Loved them all (¬´¬†Ishmael¬†¬ª more so for ancient history themes but more of that‚Äôd be great) and trying to work my way up to ¬´¬†Gravity‚Äôs Rainbow¬†¬ª (whose style and vividness blew me away in first couple of chapters but is still a bit dense for me thus far).

Much appreciated!",books,464
"I remember reading ""The Landlady"" in eighth grade and it terrified and intrigued me at the same time. I just thought of it again today and I wanted to know what you guys think about the part where Billy Weaver decides to go inside the house:  ""Each word was like a large black eye staring at him through the glass, holding him, compelling him, forcing him to stay where he was and not to walk away from that house..."" (104-108). Why did he feel so impelled to go into this particular house? It always seemed strange to me that he had other options but eerily felt drawn to this specific place????",books,596
"This is the third time I‚Äôve read Alice Sebold‚Äôs, The Lovely Bones, and each time I finish the book it just takes so much out of me. And this happens to almost every book I read. I get extremely involved in the plot and characters and it‚Äôs literally all I can think about, when I read a book I feel like I‚Äôm actually apart of the story and it sweeps me away to another place. And when it‚Äôs all over the most depressing and sinking feeling washes over me. I literally have to take a couple days to recuperate my thoughts and feelings before I can feel normal again. My mom doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs healthy, especially since I lean toward books with murder and morbid plot lines like that. A lot times I go back and reread parts of the book just to feel that ‚Äúhigh‚Äù again. I don‚Äôt know, sorry if this is incoherent, it‚Äôs like 1:30 am and my brain is actually mush, but please tell me if you ever feel this way reading books, I feel crazy because no one ever relates when I tell them about it.",books,983
"Mainly idle curiosity. I remember being in the sci fi section of a bookstore in the late 80s early 90s and reading the synopsis of the book on the back cover. All I remember is this virtual AI who is Sherlock Holmes in a virtual reality except he begins to suspect he's not real and neither is his reality. 

That's all I remember. I assume this AI exists to solve real cases.",books,376
"Sorry if this isn‚Äôt the right sub for this. 

A manager at my job lent me a book this weekend and I‚Äôm SO stressed out about not accidentally leaving any marks on it! 

I‚Äôm abusive to my own books. I eat and drink and fold corners over and stretch out the spine and I‚Äôm terrified of ruining this woman‚Äôs book! 

I took the dust jacket off and put it in an empty drawer so I wouldn‚Äôt accidentally bend it. I keep getting scared that I‚Äôm bending the spine too much because this thing is in pristine condition but it‚Äôs pretty thick. 

Any other book abusers out there?",books,564
"Hopefully I can give you a bit of back ground I know you guys like reading! I'm 40 a year old male and I am an avid film fan, bordering on film geek, I've read from what I can distinctively remember 10 or so books in my lifetime from cover to cover. I like coffee table books and own quite a few, but not ""reading books"" literally not one book! 

Here is the challenge... I have ADHD so if the story doesn't grab me in the first few pages it's done, however if it does I'm able to hyper focus, get completely immersed in the story and literally digest that book in a matter of hours and I become fanatical about it, issue is I've only ever found a handful books that have grabbed me in that way and most of those were as a kid!... They are. 

The Game - Neil Strauss
Hammer of the gods - Led Zepplin biography
Go ask Alice - name of the author escapes me. 
Of mice and men. 

The fighting Fantasy books I read as a child which were more like a game, and you could die before you reach the end of the story I got so immersed in these books I can still literally visualise the scenes in my head 30 years later. (opens ebay up in a seperate tab!)

I've also read all of Rahl Dahls book which are just magical and can't wait to read them to my children. 

When It comes to films I like twist and turns, heroes, adventure, suspense, real life stories, organised crime. The Green mile, Shawshank Redemption, usual suspects, inception etc, but I don't really want to go out and start reading the books of the films I adore I want something new. 

So I challenge you to recommend a book that grabs me in the first 5 pages a book so amazing I can't put it down. 

Feel free to ask me any further questions.",books,1697
"I just finished reading The Metamorphosis and have to say the book is one of my favourites. I just wanted to ask about peoples opinions and whether they believe the book is mostly about alienation or abandonment? I understand that both themes are present within the story but Gregor's family seem   
 to abandon him when he is no longer of use yet Gregor being a cockroach seems to distance him between his family.",books,414
"It‚Äôs my first time reading Rebecca by Daphne du Maurier and I am so captivated by it. Not only is the writing exquisite, but each of the characters are so different and fleshed out. Every page has this weight of ‚Äòsomething‚Äô hanging over it, which is particularly hard to keep going as a novel progresses. I‚Äôd heard that this was a lot of people‚Äôs favourite books and I‚Äôd never really put much thought into reading it by now. It‚Äôs nice to something else to dread at this point in time, rather than just the pandemic. 

Mrs Danvers is a fantastic villain and I DESPISE her. Cannot wait to get to the end of the story so all my questions are answered. 

Have you read Rebecca? If so, I‚Äôd love to know your thoughts.",books,712
"Hey everyone! I recently found out about Clive Cussler and his adventure books and I'm interested in reading some of them but there's just so many and so many series' that I was wondering, does it really matter if you read some out of order? If anyone has read a lot of his books, will it take away a lot from the story/relationships of characters if I only read books 2 &amp; 6 in a series for example? Appreciate the feedback!",books,428
"I try to read The Sound and the Fury a while ago, only got into 30 pages before giving up confusion. I'm going to try to finish As I lay dying, just go along for the ride. I will also try The Sound and the Fury again. I won't understand everything but for some reason I feel like reading a challenging book. I have read The Magic Mountain by Thomas Mann(over 700 pages), I was interested in it but found diffcult to read some sections that didn't have much plot but once I finished it(I almost gave up on it) has become one of my favourite books. So reading all the way sometimes I ended up loving book, I will try this logic with Faulkner. Anyone that has any experience with Faulkner's works, did you end up enjoying his writings after finishing one or more of his books?",books,773
"I have two, in terms of actually story telling it is definitely the ‚ÄúI was simply testing you, and you passed line.‚Äù Every single time I see this in literature I groan out loud. I feel like it‚Äôs a cheep way of explaining a characters motives. I‚Äôve seen it in just about any form of media now, it kind of ruined Jesus in twd comics when he said it and it even ruined sera for me in yakuza 0. The other one I have is how awkward it can be to read hardcover books. I love how they look and prefer them over paperbacks most times, however I find them annoying to carry around and half the time they either don‚Äôt stay open properly or the spine is damaged. Larger books (like the way of kings, or it) I almost always get them in paperback and then if I end up enjoying the book I upgrade my ‚Äúshelf‚Äù copy to a hardcover.",books,814
I'm currently reading Call of Cthulhu and I'm kind of overwhelmed by the amount of racist ideas in it. I'm aware that Lovecraft is a product of his time but I didn't expect his beliefs to show as much as it does. It's extremely disappointing considering how much I'm interested in the ideas of the unknown that are presented. The racism is honestly making it hard to enjoy the story and it sucks even more since I was going to read his other stories afterwards. Is this present in all of them?,books,493
"I remember being in 2nd grade and my teacher had bins full of books, and I remember reading this one illustrated by Quentin Blake about a bunch of bad/spoiled kids dying in horrible accidents and I can not remember the name of the book. The only death I remember is this kid being killed by a lion. Anyone knows what I‚Äôm talking about? Was it some type of weird fever dream I had? I need some clarification.",books,407
"I think my title may come off a bit weird, but for some reason, I have been lacking the regular ""huzzah!"" feeling that I had always had with the books that I read. What I mean by this is that I am able to read a  book and drudge through the novel, but the feeling that comes with reading something that I would regularly find moving or emotional has left. For example, some of my favourite types of books are books that deal with existential discussions about life and in general, normally make me feel a sort of way towards well, I guess life in itself. However, for the past couple of months, everything I have read seems so shallow- with even books like ""1984"" and ""This side of Paradise"" failing to make me feel anything other than just a bit of excitement. The awe that came with reading seems to have left- which was, in general, the thing that got me interested in reading in the first place.",books,899
"I wrote a book that I would like to publish. It‚Äôs more along the lines of Go the F*ck to Sleep, where it‚Äôs written like a children‚Äôs book, but not necessarily something you would read to your kid.

"So I just read The Great Gatsby and watched the movie and realized the book is much easier to understand.

"I am halfway into Fifty Shades Freed, quite speedy reading on the other two. I realize the books were published in 2011, but I had other things to do during this time. I think the books are worth the read and quite good for most of it, the author can definitely write about sex, intercourse, or whatever you want to call it, making love, bumping uglies. The core of the book is sex, I think where the author lacked, is the back story. 

As for any of the silly chatter, it is a book...a book you can choose to read or not read. I am glad I read it but then, I also love reading Judith Krantz books and Stephen King, who also write explicit sex scenes.",books,651

"There are a lot of common tips that I see being posted time and time again that I disagree with / dont work for me. This can and probably is a personal thing as different things might work for different people. 

But for me, these advices I usually disagree with:

1. ‚ÄúRead at least a little bit each day‚Äù

I find that I do most of my reading in large chunks rather than in smaller pieces. People often say to bring your book with you everywhere to get 15 minutes of reading while on the bus or somewhere else. I have found that anything less than 30 minutes its not enough for me to get inside the book and in the right mindset. Doing small chunks of 15 minutes throughout the day would result in sub par reading from me. 

2. ‚ÄúDont be afraid to not finish books you are not enjoying‚Äù

Not finishing a book for me would be a cardinal sin. I do my research on books to make sure other people have enjoyed it, and I do not let myself start books I am not going to finish. There are countless books that I had to push myself to finish because of some dry parts that have ended up becoming favourites after I have finished them. In general, I dont see books as movies, where its easy to just watch and enjoy and finish the movie. Books usually take motivation, will and the good stuff is not ‚Äúgiven‚Äù to you, you gotta put the effort to engage with the book and finish it.",books,1368
"Hear me out please. I know it would usually be fine to listen instead of read, but because of the graphics and the art it seems like there may be more that gets lost in the translation. I love Gaiman and have read everthing else he's done, but Sandman has always seemed daunting. Is there anyone who is a fan of the comics and has listened to the audio that could help me please? It is supposed to be an absolutely wonderful cast with a great production. Thanks!",books,462
"For me it was Alistair MacLean. I just read a short novel of his called ‚ÄúNight Without End.‚Äù It was a riveting and tight novel about survival near the North Pole that was also an excellent ‚Äúwhodunit‚Äù. I couldn‚Äôt put this book down and odd as it sounds it felt like the novel equivalent of the movie ‚Äúspeed‚Äù.
 After that, I went to the bookstore and bought all the other MacLean novels they had. The next one I read was ‚ÄúGoodbye California‚Äù another tense thriller With a solidly researched scientific background. Sure these books are a little dated, but the way he writes dialogue is something I think everyone should experience once. It‚Äôs also refreshing to read a terrorism thriller novel from the perspective of someone who lived prior to the horrible age we inhabit now.",books,773
"I recently started reading The Grapes of Wrath (still haven't finished, on the chapter where the family gets to know the government camp) and I'm f****** loving it. It gives you moments of pure cruelty that those people had to endure in the search for a better life, while still being as wholesome as possible even in the most heartbreaking moments. An example if that was the death of the grandmother which highlights (in my opinion) the best written character in the book, the mother (I don't know if I should spoil it for those wo event read this book, but it's soooo brutal). Mother is probably the woman should want in their life, such stoic mindset for the betterment and well being of the family is honestly inspiring.
Tho there were some issues I've been having with it, like the plotline with Noah that's kind comes out of nowhere, the book is pretty awesome and I wanted to take a the to just show some love for it, know how you guys felt about the book and to HIGHLY recommend it.

"So books that the themes or the driving force of the novel is discussed within the novel or is obvious, does that make the book less rewarding or do you prefer that?

"I think any of us who have read Steinbeck's *East of Eden* know instinctively that Cathy represents pure chaotic evil--""Satan,"" if you will. Considering the overarching Biblical allegory of the novel--notably the fall of Adam and the kin-slaying of Abel--I posit that Cathy represents the Edenic Serpent who tricked Eve into biting from the fruit of wisdom (who I believe is represented by Abra but that's a whole other deep dive I might get into one day) and whose arms and legs were soon after detached by God as punishment. I kept track of every serpentine reference I came across to compile this list. Allow me to point out the numerous excerpts that brought me, overwhelmingly, to my conclusion:

&amp;#x200B;

1. In Steinbeck's famous treatise on the nature of monsters: **‚Äúsome are born with no arms and no legs‚Äù** (72)

2. ‚ÄúCathy was chewing on a piece of meat, chewing with her front teeth. Samuel had never seen anyone chew that way before. **And when she swallowed, her little tongue flickered around her lips**‚Äù (173). *Res ipsa loquitur*.

3. In his anxiety-ridden flashback, Samuel recalls a ""‚Äògolden man"" whose malevolent eyes remind him of the cool and detached eyes he had seen in Cathy. In Samuel‚Äôs memory, the golden man **‚Äúseemed to have no arms‚Äù** (178). In this vision of Satanic embodiment, Steinbeck is keen to drop in a subtle but unmistakable allusion to the Serpent of Eden.

4. In reference to Cathy, Steinbeck writes **""maybe such a look may have been sometime on a holy face‚Äù** (179). Is it not fitting that the evilest being in Biblical history happened to have once dwelt in the holiest (or at least, purest) site?

5. ""Her voice became chill and her mouth was thin. **Her wide-set eyes slitted** and grew watchful and sardonic."" (234)

6. \[Looking at Cathy\] ‚ÄúAdam peered at the girl before him . . . He tried to think of what animal, what night prowler, she reminded him. **It was some secret and predatory animal**.‚Äù (315)

7. \[Cathy to Adam\]: ""You‚Äôll come crawling back . . . **You‚Äôll drag your belly on the floor**\--begging, begging!"" (325) Ironic!

8. Ok, this one's a stretch but I think it's worth adding. Says Tom to Dessie, **‚ÄúI‚Äôve been dragging myself in misery like a spine-broken snake.‚Äù** (398)

9. **‚ÄúShe moistened her lips with an arrow-shaped tongue‚Äù** (505)

 *And this is probably my strongest token of evidence...*

10. Cathy tells Joe to **‚Äúcut these off--at the wrists‚Äù** (549) in reference to her hands. Additionally, her **""right hip ached when it moved""** (549). The debilitating and even incapacitating arthritis we see Cathy develop is a direct metaphor for God's famous retribution of the Serpent. After committing her crime, she is plagued by the deterioration of her hands and legs--distinctly analogous to the punishment of the Serpent at the fall of Adam.

Lastly, and most importantly, it should be noted that Cathy is the reason for the fall of Adam's ranch (What Adam calls his personal ""Eden"") into disarray. She is the pure evil and chaos that leads to Adam‚Äôs hardship and depression--analogous to the serpent, whose conniving lands the original Adam with a punishment entailed by working for his food and having to overcome inexorable ""thorns and thistles"" along the way.

"Hello everyone! Today I finished The Hobbit. I wanted to open a discussion for my sake on how to go about understanding this novel I began reading about three weeks ago. 
This is not the first fantasy book I‚Äôve read. I started with the Mistborn Trilogy, The Kingkiller Chronicles (I didn‚Äôt make it past Felurian sadly), and TSA up to Oathbringer. That being said, I didn‚Äôt want to gloss over any details by listening to the book on Audible like I have all the others, so I instead read the whole thing. Unfortunately, I think I missed something.

Firstly, while I really enjoyed reading this book, it did not appeal to me as strongly as the more contemporary fiction I have read. I think my interest in the book began to seriously wane after Bilbo escaped the Elvenking‚Äôs prison. After that, I kind of just wanted the story to be over. Once I finally got to Smaug, I felt nearly as exhausted as Bilbo must have felt at the end of his journey, and even more so when Thorin decided to start shit with all the kingdoms leading up to the Battle of Five Armies. I started glossing over a lot of text, which I know is bad because I want to process all the information available, but I suspect Tolkien was writing at this point to conclude the story, and nothing more.

I believe there is something that I am missing. I know this book was meant for children, but I am unable to parse any meaning from Bilbo‚Äôs adventure other than Thorin‚Äôs dying words about appreciating song and cheer over dragon‚Äôs gold. I wonder what significant puzzles or allegories did I miss during my first reading. Other than being delighted by the journey at face value, and watching Bilbo grow from a lazy hobbit to a brave and cunning burglar, what aspects of this story I am missing?

At any rate, I wish everyone the best of luck on their journeys. I recommend reading The Hobbit, if you have not already. Soon, I must turn my sails towards up and coming class assignments. Thank you for reading!",books,1968

I laughed and damn near cried at times. The cattle drive to Montana will forever be in my heart as one of the greatest journeys of all time.

"It's so easy to get comfortable with one author or one genre, wanting to explore that world and the style it entails. I read two or three time travel type books last year, and after awhile it seemed like I was reading the same book over and over. 

So I switched to Ruth Ware's work and it was pretty good.

I was a bit confused why Bernard and Helmholtz just happily retired to islands and didn't fight more.

"To me Circe was the best of the gods, sure she wasnt the most powerful or the most beautiful, but she let herself feel and deal with things that the other gods were so scared of.
She let herself feel pain, failure, shame, jealousy and all those other feelings that make us human. 


These feelings were quite foreign to Circe, considering the fact that the gods were not to show weakness. 
Exiling Circe was the best gift fhe gods ever gave her. Not only did they let her grow, they helped her get home to herself.

even though it took her centuries to find her place in the world she still did.

I'm revisiting them now in audio book form beginning with Shogun, and come to find out they were not written in chronological order in terms of when they are set.

I've also tried checking if there is a translator listed  in  the the books' Goodreads pages but translators are rarely added, especially in English books in Goodreads.

"I just finished the Unwind Dystology by Neal Shusterman. I'm not good at explaining things but it's basically where parents can choose to post-abort their children from ages to 13-17 and centres around a group of those children who managed to escape that fate.

&amp;#x200B;

I usually don't let politics guide what I read or indulge in at all, and this to me really didn't seem like a political series, it was such a bizarre unrealistic scenario that didn't seem like ""abortion"" at all as it was heavily post-birth.  


My problem is that after finishing I was reading some posts online of readers who thought the author was anti-abortion and that was one of the main point of the series. I'm 100% pro-choice when it comes to abortion, so if that's the actual case and this series was made for that then I do have a problem with it. I can't find anything on the author's twitter to check his views on the matter either.  


For other readers of the book : do you find this as a political series or just an interesting and unique setup like I did. I just can't see how something as absurd as murder from 13 to 17 can be taken as protesting abortions and the reasons behind them.

This was right before they switched over to the new artist. Eventually they did a revised box set in 2017 which looks similar to the one I had, but I had lost my old ones and wanted to get the original copies I had. 

I tried looking on Amazon, Ebay, etc, but all I could find were people selling the 2017 edition, or if not that, they never specify and just used stock photos. Super frustrating. Was hoping there is some advice I could get for tracking down certain prints of books.

"I like to travel across the world when I read novels. 

I like to get a feel for life in a snapshot of a time and place (sometimes placeS). Like how A Suitable Boy transports me to 1950s India, or War and Peace does the same for Tsarist Russia. They don't have to be big, massive tomes either (that's just my own preference) - but consider the Feast of the Goat or The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao - both transport you to the DR, but neither is incredibly long.  I want to feel like I'm actually there, in the brutal cold of winter or the unbearable heat of summer, whether it's raging against an unjust government, trying to eke out bare survival, experience forbidden romance, or anything else that drives the plot of a novel.

Currently, I'm reading Shadow Country, which transports me to the southwest coast of Florida in the late 19th/early 20th century. I've been to Florida a lot in my life, as I have family there, but never to this part of the state.

"Brad Thor's ""Near Dark"" spy thriller was a good read, where he battled alcoholism and depression after his wife was murdered (In the previous book), while simultaneously hunting down her killers who placed a huge bounty on his head, which was open to all assassins, worldwide. His characterization was excellent- even the evil doers were three-dimensional, where he brought out their past and you understood why the became who they were. I noticed his ratings on Amazon were mostly 4- and 5-Stars, but some gave him very low ratings. You either liked the book, or didn't.

"I‚Äôve always been an avid reader, but I‚Äôve never really enjoyed classic literature. I thought it was boring and needlessly hard to read. And when school made such readings mandatory, I found myself mostly only reading summaries on the Internet. And I know most of my classmates took such a disliking to classics as to never touch them again after high school.

But now, a few months after graduating, I found myself growing more and more interested in classic literature, to the point some modern books don‚Äôt seem to satisfy me anymore. 

I was reading the modern dystopian series The Maze Runner, and I was loving it (I still love it, actually). But in the middle of the fourth book I picked up a Jane Austen to read. Then when I came bake to TMR i could only go a few pages before I decided I wanted another reading like Austen‚Äôs and picked up a national classic. It‚Äôs been three classic books since and I still haven‚Äôt been able to finish TMR. 

I feel like classics provide such a high pleasure, based on the very sake of reading and learning new words and pushing yourself, and basically enjoying the story and reading in itself, other than on individual juicy/action parts made to seem enticing and hook up the reader. 

I‚Äôm not saying modern literature isn‚Äôt good. I love so many modern books. But I feel like there‚Äôs a time when people learn by themselves to appreciate things in a deeper level. Now I‚Äôm addicted to classics and I want to read everything I skipped in high school. To read those stories that I thought were boring but that now I can see are so very interesting when you take the time to dedicate yourself to the reading.

But I don‚Äôt think I would‚Äôve enjoyed them as much if somebody had forced me to read them at a time I wasn‚Äôt ready. I understand why schools have to it, it‚Äôs important to make us acquainted with our classics, show us timeless literature, but I also have the impression that the way it‚Äôs currently done it might have the opposite effect and push people further away from books :(

"There were several books that were required reading in High School, that I absolutely hated.   
One was ""Death Comes to the Archbishop"". I recently re-read it and absolutely loved it. So much so that I read everything I could find by Willa Cather. High School was 40 years ago. I am sure that greater life experience added to my enjoyment.  
There are two books I am considering re-reading and would appreciate your opinion which I should re-read first.  
1. ""The Old Man in the Sea"" I found it tedious as a teenager.  
2. ""Ghosts"" by  Henrick Ibsen. I was required to write a paper on it. Mine was titled ""Sexual Perversions in Ibsen's ""Ghosts"". Caused quite a bit of discussion in my AP English class.",books,703

"Hi! I‚Äôm a 15 year old girl, and I have a 9 year old little brother. Long story short, my mom doesn‚Äôt live with me, so I tutor my little brothers (the other one is 13, he‚Äôs doing okay in school) for my dad.

My little brother is really difficult to deal with. He throws tantrums, screams, is super stubborn, doesn‚Äôt ask for help, and the most annoying thing: he only cares about video games. It wouldn‚Äôt be a problem if it was the only hobby he‚Äôs ever had, so much to the point that it has made him fall very behind in school, especially with distance learning.

He‚Äôs so behind in his reading (he never reads books for fun) that he‚Äôs in ESOL (For kids whose first language isn‚Äôt English) even though the only language he speaks is English! He also is struggling in math, which is understandable. I‚Äôve just been giving him a lot of worksheets that I make myself to give him practice.

Would any of you be willing to share tips on how to handle his resentment towards learning? I‚Äôve been tutoring him for about a month now, and I‚Äôll admit, there were days I just couldn‚Äôt handle it and had to take a break. Not related, but he‚Äôs a picky eater and always screams and refuses to eat what my dad gives him. I wish he‚Äôd be more grateful for what he has. 

I tried to make reading fun for him, but I don‚Äôt have a lot of books and going to the library is not an option during this time... He hates all the books I try to read to him, and that‚Äôs not his fault. It‚Äôs hard to read a book you‚Äôre not interested in.

Would anyone be willing to buy/donate him some chapter books that a 9 year old boy with an obsession with video games would like? Maybe something you‚Äôve outgrown, or just anything (I don‚Äôt really have that many books either, and would appreciate if someone donated a book they liked to me üòä). 

We don‚Äôt  really have money to spare on books, and it would help me out so much. He‚Äôs in 3rd grade and should be reading chapter books by now... I have the 4th Percy Jackson book and the hunger games series but they‚Äôre a bit too advanced for him and I don‚Äôt really have anything else. 

Thank you so so so much for reading this, I don‚Äôt really expect anything to come out of this, but thought I would try anyway.

"Hello!

First of all, I want to say that my mom's birthday is getting closer and I've no idea what to buy her.

She told me many times that she wanted to buy herself some books in russian because, she loves to read and also has some sort of weak spot for russian as it seems (she's Polish and back when Poland was under the Soviet regime she had to learn that language in school)

Of course, her russian vocabulary isn't as good as it used to be, since she didn't use that in a long time, but recently she bought herself ""the little prince"" by Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry, and I was thinking that she would really enjoy something like that.

I was thinking if you could help me with finding something like that, because I've tried to find something similiar (a book that is good for a child and an adult), and of course something without such difficult vocabulary (like ""Crime and punishment"" by Fiodor Dostoyevsky).

I was thinking about Winnie the Pooh (1926), because that book had an awesome meaning and was really wholesome, but I couldn't find any good translation to Russian... I couldn't use any Russian sites as I can't speak Russian.

"Holy smokes was a farewell to arms not what I was expecting. I have not read Ernest Hemingway since highschool and the stark miniamlism of his work can still convey so much meaning. The simplicity of his writing style does so much to display the illogic of war, its absence of reason and understanding, even when there is the cynical awareness of this fact it still just churns on.

The ending hit me like a brick. Even though I knew that something had to go wrong (it is Hemingway after all) the sheer suddenness of it, and the simple terms in how it is catalogued only elevates it. I am simply struck by how pivotal life changing moments are depicted as simply mundane, and how the inexorable march of time shall always carry on, and life still continues on.",books,760

**In a life filled with meaning and accomplishment, Michelle Obama has emerged as one of the most iconic and compelling women of our era. As First Lady of the United States of America‚Äîthe first African American to serve in that role‚Äîshe helped create the most welcoming and inclusive White House in history, while also establishing herself as a powerful advocate for women and girls in the U.S. and around the world, dramatically changing the ways that families pursue healthier and more active lives, and standing with her husband as he led America through some of its most harrowing moments. Along the way, she showed us a few dance moves, crushed Carpool Karaoke, and raised two down-to-earth daughters under an unforgiving media glare. In her memoir, a work of deep reflection and mesmerizing storytelling, Michelle Obama invites readers into her world, chronicling the experiences that have shaped her‚Äîfrom her childhood on the South Side of Chicago to her years as an executive balancing the demands of motherhood and work, to her time spent at the world‚Äôs most famous address. With unerring honesty and lively wit, she describes her triumphs and her disappointments, both public and private, telling her full story as she has lived it‚Äîin her own words and on her own terms. Warm, wise, and revelatory, Becoming is the deeply personal reckoning of a woman of soul and substance who has steadily defied expectations‚Äîand whose story inspires us to do the same.**

"Finished Inland by T√©a Obreht this evening. It's a very unusual book, but man, what a story. And written unlike any other book I can remember reading. It's a western, but a surreal one at that. The story is intricate and clever, and the characters are convincing, especially in their faults. It's a solemn story and like any true western it speaks to the cruelty of its time. Death is a prevalent theme, as is water (or lack thereof.)  I'd be very intrigued to hear anyone else's take on it as I'm still reeling and honestly, grappling with the conclusion. 

I looked her up and saw that she has written one other book, The Tiger's Wife, which I can tell from the synopsis has similar themes, though a different setting. Has anyone read it? I've placed a hold on it at the library as I enjoyed Inland so much.",books,809

I never read or watch anything out of order! FRWL is the fifth book in the series! The beginning makes more sense now, because it seems to pick up from something. I just assumed the book would tell me the missing pieces later.

"Hi everyone,

I have had this issue with books since I began reading novels as a kid.

I have always had a hard time falling asleep, even when I am exhausted, and escaping my reality via reading is a big help. And that only works with books I am very invested in.

The problem is I am so invested I cannot put them down. I regularly find myself reading through the night, and even sometimes the day when I have no obligations. I understand that is not out of the ordinary, but what I am struggling with here is that this happens every night in stressful times (vicious cycle of stress &gt; read to destress &gt; lose sleep + lose time &gt; more stress).

So in short, do some of you have experience with books making you lose sleep regularly ? Have you find some kind of trick to help put down a book ?",books,802

"Let me start by saying, yes the themes of a court system that doesn‚Äôt allow lawyers but encourages them and is hidden in attics where the guilty are inevitably doomed to always be guilty is hilarious because of how absurd it is. I don‚Äôt think the book gets enough credit for it‚Äôs funny moments.

One of the funniest sequences I‚Äôve ever read in a book is the part where the lawyer (or was it the painter) is discussing how one time a group of lawyers were trying to get into the court. An old angry magister didn‚Äôt want to let them in (because by virtue of being lawyers they aren‚Äôt allowed in anyway) and was repeatedly tossing them down the stairs. The group of lawyers solution is a Monty Python skit that never was where they, one by one, ascend the stairs and, as passively as possible, allow themselves to be thrown down in order the pacify the old man. 

Of course the book is dark, but you have to see the genius of a sequence like this. While ‚ÄòThe Trial‚Äô is ‚Äúincomplete‚Äù it‚Äôs passages like this, or the painter repeatedly offering the same painting for K. To buy that really make it shine for me.",books,1104

"Like everyone, I've read the book On The Road by Jack Kerouac earlier in my 20s. I had really liked the book, I thought the story was fun and connected with the main character(s). I was vaguely aware of the backstory of this book, and of Kerouac's life, and was naturally impressed by the fact that when it was released this book influenced a whole generation of the USA. It really did create a huge impact and was (rightfully) extremely popular and successful at the time. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to November 2019, I was on a train headed to visit some friends NYC (I am also like Kerouac of French-Canadian descent) and had taken out two of his other books  - one book of short stories-essays and the other Visions of Cody (I believe). Reading these two books launched me on an unbelievable reading journey that has me thoroughly convinced that Jack Kerouac is the greatest American author to be produced by the WW2.

&amp;#x200B;

From November 2019 to March 2020 I read all 14 of the books he wrote, over 2 million words spanning is own lived legend (The Duluoz Legend) all interconnected master works of litterature and all relating (in half-fiction, half-reality) the entirety of his life events. I don't have the right words to communicate how seriously amazing this book series is and I truly believe that it has not received nearly as much credit as it deserves. But I'm also sure that he will eventually be recognized as the incredibly smart and sensitive man that he was (it pisses me off when all people know about him is that he died from a  haemorrhage caused by a lifetime of drinking). 

&amp;#x200B;

There are so many incredible books in this serious, lovable characters, wonderful insights about life and philosophy and inner peace and the best part is is that it is FUNNY. 

&amp;#x200B;

These are amazing novels that should not be missed by anyone who likes books. The Town and The City might be the best American Novel I've ever read... What fascinates me about this author is how in pretty much every book the character names are different... but they all relate to the same story (His Life). 

&amp;#x200B;

Again, I highly encourage you to read the complete works of a man who claimed that:

'In every person's life, there is enough material for an legend, it simply has to be written down.'

TOP 3 BOOK FROM THE DULUOZ LEGEND

The Town and The City (his longest volume)

"Hello everyone,

Welcome to the second discussion thread for August Book Club in which we will cover Chapter 8 through 16 of *The Traitor Baru Cormorant* by Seth Dickinson. The action sure picked up in these chapters. Here are the discussion questions:

&gt; How could she forget that? How could she weigh cousin Lao and Father Salm more heavily than the fate of nations? Surely that would be irrational. Surely it would be better to walk the narrow, safe path. To remain an Imperial Accountant, rather than daring everything on this incredible gambit.

* What do you think of this quote? Is it right of Baru to weigh her desire to protect/avenge her family more heavily than the good The Masquerade might be bringing to other lives?

&gt; ""Your tactics are self-centered. You have forgotten that you are not the only player on the board, that inherent talent speaks for no more than experience, and that others around you seek to expand their authority and constrain yours. Your error is fundamental to the human psyche: you have allowed yourself to believe that others are mechanisms, static and solvable, whereas you are an agent.""

* What did you think of Purity Cartone's assessment of Baru? Do you think she will be able to overcome this, or is it an inherent part of her/human nature?

* Why do you think Tain Hu decided to step in as Baru's second, even though Xate Yawa (and the Phantom Duke) didn't think the time was right to start a new rebellion? Why do you think Cattlson stepped in as a second as well?

&gt; It's not what the Masquerade does to you that you should fear, she wanted to tell Ake. It's what the Masquerade convinces you to do to yourself. 

* Do you agree with this?

* Should Baru have warned Muire Lo, so that he could warn his family?

&gt; If you are a duke in Aurdwynn and you see an insurrection rising, you face a choice. [...] You cast your lot with the rebellion, or with the loyalists. You are ruined if your side fails. You hold your position, maybe even benefit, if your side wins. But the thing about rebellions is that they involve a great deal of treason, mm? The traitors cannot condemn treason. So the safest bet is to remain a loyalist at first, and then switch sides if the traitors seem certain to win, pretending you're terribly clever and have been hampering the loyalists from within. You see the difficulty?

* Do you think the collection of Dukes that are part of the rebellion can be trusted? Can they solve the Traitor's Qualm?

"Okay, so after some extensive googling I found out that **James Frey's ""A Million Little Pieces""** is considered a disgrace to the liturature world of writers and readers. And all because he botched a few things in  his memoir. I'm sorry, but I find that a bit stupid. 

His book is about his *personnal* experience at rehab, how *he* viewed himeself and the world around him. About *his* thoughts and feelings towards what happened to him.

Now, I do not in fact know about the ""rules"" or writing a memoir are, nor do I care.

I've always thought that being creative writers - and artists - meant that you can write what ever you want to write , regardless of "" Rules"" Creativity shouldn't have rules.  Everyone has their own a opinion - on the world, people, even fictional worlds. Do you get what I'm saying?

To me, writing is a way to relive myself of whatever I'm holding in, of my thoughts and feelings. Meaning : I put myself into my writing, regardless. 

James Frey did in fact, change a few things but it's *his* memoir , *his* story and he shouldn't have been ridiculed for botching a few things. It's HIS version of his life.

I'm not trying to be rude to anyone, or offend those who believed that his botching some stuff is a great horror. Nor am I trying to be rude to Ophrah. Do you get what  I mean?

"I got curious when I saw this in the bookstore. I don‚Äôt really like the idea of retelling stories that I love by a different author, and I loved The Little Prince very dearly. I cried over that book when I first read it. However, this was not the case when I read The Return of the Young Prince.

Frankly, I wish I never read this at all. Though this has a lot of life lessons, it felt more like a long essay than a story. The big difference from the two books is the story telling. The Little Prince was so imaginative and the lessons need to be interpreted which gave a lot of room for creativity and reflection. The Return of the Young Prince felt very preachy and direct, no interpretation needed. It‚Äôs as if the author wanted to give an essay on life lessons and disguise it in a famous story.

"I don't know if it's because they're shipping books in regular boxes and don't seem to use the 'vacuum seal' old style packaging for books anymore, or maybe their employees just don't care... but I can't seem to get a book off Amazon anymore that isn't beat to shit. I just counted, and I've had to return 9 of 37 books I've purchased this year due to damage. I have 3 others that probably should have been returned as well but I needed them for a class and didn't have time to wait. 

Dust jackets are frequently bent up, or even ripped. Today was the last straw, I bought a $50 coffee table book and there was a 3 inch rip on the front of the dust jacket. I've sent multiple other books back for the damage that poor shipping has caused. 

And it's not just poor shipping, I have received two books that were definitely counterfeit, more than a few that have bent pages, plenty with markings, or poorly placed way too sticky stickers.

I know Amazon isn't just a book store anymore, and hasn't been for a while. I guess I need to remove that association from my mind and go elsewhere. 

It's tough to see any alternative at this point with the pandemic, but I'm going to stop buying books off Amazon. The hassle of driving to drop off a return, would be energy better spent just going to my local book store. I'm using Amazon to avoid going out, yet I'm still having to.

"I just set down a book last night after running into my biggest pet peeve: a main character who ""somehow"" wins. And I mean this literally, I hate the word ""somehow"" when the MC is struggling to overcome some obstacle (fight, puzzle, etc) that they've been progressing towards the entire book. *How* they win this fight is more important to me than the fact that they do - I'm expecting them to overcome the challenge, and would actually be impressed if a MC actually fails due to lack of preparation or poor judgment.

As a quasi example, this is a paraphrase of the passage that made me add the book to my nascent Did Not Finish list:

*MC reached for his sword, just out of fingers reach. Somehow he was able to secure it and he raised himself, dripping blood, to his feet with the last of his energy. The Big Bad shot another ball  of death, and MC somehow found the energy to dodge. The Big Bad lunged for him with inhuman speed but somehow just missed. The MC grabbed a throwing star that he had never used before and somehow threw it 500 feet exactly into the 1x1cm destruction point on the Big Bad*

I've noticed this in self published authors, but I've also found it in several books by the bigger names in fantasy. I don't know if it's used as a placeholder that's never removed during editing (rereading that and dropping the ""somehow""s takes a way a little drama but helps with the immersion), I don't know if it's a standard crutch that's over used, but it grates me every time and I feel like it's a simple fix once authors are aware of it.

"It seems to be an exception for any well-known novels to be affirming towards some positive attitude or idea about life. Nonetheless, I get it. I‚Äôve had a fair amount of exposure to philosophy, so I understand how myopic it is to surmise that positivity is a sufficient reaction to the human condition. But I‚Äôm unconvinced by this common sentiment in literature that a novel can only be really insightful if it is provocative.

For instance- 1984. I constantly hear about how enlightening the book is, but in a profoundly heart-wrenching, almost debilitating way. Not to denigrate the quality of the work nor neglect the particular insights that can be gained from it, I simply just want to immerse myself into a narrative that still has an effectual allegory exposing certain qualities of the human condition *beyond* the despair or emptiness that we may all come across.

I might just feel this way because I haven‚Äôt encountered enough books, haven‚Äôt read well enough, or because it is much past my usual bedtime, but there is definitely a personal aspect to this. Without turning this post into neurosis-sourced blabbering, I may suffice to mention that I feel the need to read more renowned novels so I gain a wider, more creative perspective of the world, but many of them don‚Äôt seem like the type of book I should read at this particularly sensitive point in my life.

That being said, what books should I look into? I‚Äôm open to **any** other input on this matter",books,1469

"I have read ""Percy Jackson"" and whenever I hear about ""American Gods"" it seems to me to have a similar premise, however I never see them compared. My understanding is that they both revolve around the premise that the ancient gods are living as they did in the ancient world, except in modern day America.  Are there any similarities beyond this?

"Obviously the reigning queen of this emerging trend is Sally Rooney, who also managed to write compellingly about college students which is rarer than one might think.

I read both of these this year and now am reading ""Exciting Times"" by Naoise Dolan AND ITS THE SAME THING (but set in Hong Kong). A quick Google has shown me that the NYT has made this connection, but I don't want to read their review until I'm done with the book. I'm not complaining, in fact I would love to read more! If you have any additions to throw on the pile, even if they only hit a few of the sad/horney/bisexual/Irish adjectives, let me know.

I thought perhaps I put it into a drawer in the bedside table, but it wasn't there. Well maybe I knocked it under the bed or behind the table....nope.

Frustrated at the thought that a book could just go missing, I started looking around the room. Maybe my wife put it back on the bookshelf, or it found it's way to a waredrobe. Well I couldn't find it in any obvious place. Growing incresingly frustrated as I searched, I tore the house apart in search of it. 

I've literally taken this place apart in search. Behind the fridge, through every box in the store room, behind the couch cushions, even the place where one sock of the pair end up and I can't find it.

"I finished Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment and was more disappointed than happy about the book. It's my first Dostoevsky book and also the introduction to more dense russian literature. General consens was that it is a masterpiece and will change a reader's life, but I'll have to disagree. Of course, Dostoevsky was the first in his time to publish a book that details the psychology of a murderer and I'll give him credit for that. However, I feel like I read books that did that way better than he did.  
I listed some complaints and questions I had about the book. Feel free to dispute them, and please argue why you feel like it's a masterpiece!


1. The writing style 
I don't now how much this was influenced by the german translation I read of the book, but the style was one of the main problems I had while reading it. 

The details, the descriptions - all of that was great and I really liked how he described character's facial expressions etc. The dialouge was the issue for me. It mostly consisted of one party talking for multiple pages and, although I am used to monolouges, it felt unnatural and most of the time unnecessary. Why? Because the monologues were made by character's who where, at that time, irrelevant to the story but became relevant a few 100 pages later by scripted  coincidence ( Marmeladov) or the character's talked for the sake of talking and even the main character reminds them multiple times to get to the point (Svidrigailov and the detective).
Of course this also shows the mental state of the other character, but you could try to do that in a more subtle way. Often minor characters would also ramble, which was annoying to me. 
Overall it was very painful to read through because the dialouge seemed unnecessary to me. I hated the detective, not because he questioned Raskolnikov,
but because he talked so much that he annoyed me as much as he did Raskolnikov! If that was the intention of those scenes, well played.

2. Story
The utilitarian idea of Raskolnikov was never disputed or even debated in the book. The detective questions him about his article, but that's it. Everbody else just acts shocked and scared of that thought. 
He did the deed because he thought he was superior, but never actually helped anyone by doing so. In the end he even says that he does not regret his actions and was only a 'failure', that's why he couldn't become a Napoleon. A fever dream about humanitiy's egoism destroying it does not really invalidate his theory. Then he is saved by the love of Sonya and good old Jesus? Did that make him now less self centered and more regretful? 
As you can see, the ending fell really flat for me. Especially the Jesus part annoyed me because I just dislike religion as a counter argument. It seems like the author wanted to say that too much egoism makes you bad and the theory is not really logically wrong but because of feelings. Which is the empathy argument and could have been used earlier but nobody wanted to discuss  Raskolnikov's ideas. I would have prefered a direct discussion or at least some argument because, framed like this, it just means that Raskolnikov was not 'strong enough' to be a Napoleon and that the theory itsself is right. One example of failure does not mean that everything is wrong. 

3. Characters 
Raskolnikov really seems kind of crazy and douchy most of the time. I disliked him right of the bat but I think that was the point. However, Dostoevsky described his mental breakdowns really well. Nothing more to add.

Razumikhin was an unrealistically good friend? I did not understand why he helped Raskolnikoff all the time despite him being an asshole and them knowing each other only for 1,5 years prior to the story. Maybe friendship back then was more intense? 

Sonya was also unrealistically good. Guy who paid for your father's funeral comes to you for the second time, clearly mentally unstable(first time was creepy already), tells you he killed your friend(!!!) and her evil sister and your reaction is to pity him because he looked tormented? What? Then he goes on about how he doesn't regret any of it and you still pity him? Double what? 
Sonya was on the verge of a mental breakdown too but why wasn't she scared of him? She saw the good in him? Because of her faith? Please don't start with that. It seemed unrealistic to me.

Svidrigailov's character confused me. We are told that he is evil incarnate, raping young girls left and right, driving people into suicide and poisoning his wife. The question here remains wether these rumours, some of them told by despicable characters, are true. He fails to rape Dunya, gives his money to people, has nightmares (probably out of guilt) and then kills himself. 
Now...why did he do that when he basically is the devil already and didn't get caught yet (like Raskolnikoff did by the detective)? Out of heartbreak? That seems pretty unlikely to me because of his history. He felt haunted by his crimes and alone? He saw the ghosts of the deceased and was generally weird in conversation, so that could be. But why did his conscience act up now? He had enough money to distract himself from that.  Because the author wanted to have a contrast to Raskolnikoff who chose to live? That's a stupid reason to kill off a character. So why?

Luzhin was despicable and vanished in the later part of the story; Dunya and the mother were there wondering 'What is wrong with him?' mostly during the story;  minor characters either died or just vanished because they were not important anymore.
Overall the characters were the best part of the book because they were fleshed out. I thought their 'goodness' was sometimes unrealistic, which broke my immersion.",books,5714
"Hey...  


(Let me preface this by saying I'm not sure if this breaks any rules, if so I totally understand if this post gets removed. I would very much appreciate if someone could guide me to a suitable subreddit, should it be the case.)  


About a year ago I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ajpdu5/i_feel_like_reading_out_loud_for_each_other_is/) about how much I feel reading to each other has become an underrated thing to do, that garnered some attention here. I felt like I should bring an update  
To reiterate:  


&gt; I feel the age old tradition of reading to each other has faded away, and I think it's a tragedy. There is something about having someone read or tell you a story. There is this magical combination of the way the story is told, shaped by the tone and tempo if the voice, and your own imagination. The magic is that something happens that would not have occurred if you ""simply"" read the story yourself. It comes to life in another way, and for many it's less straining on your concentration. Others don't like to read by themselves.  
&gt;  
&gt;Audio books are a great way to get a similar experience, but to me they lack the feeling that the book is read, in this moment, to you. You miss the facial expressions of the reader, or the gestures that underline certain points.  
&gt;  
&gt;I personally read very often to my family. Whether that be a night time story for the kids or something more fitting for my wife after we've gone to bed. It's a kind of quality time I wouldn't miss for the world.  
&gt;  
&gt;Besides storytelling, another big passion of mine - that used to be me my professional occupation - is music. I love finding new and obscure music and especially - sharing it with others.  
&gt;  
&gt;I've combined those two passions in a hobby of mine, where I do live recordings from passages of books, poems and such, while I at the same time mix music that matches the mood and the progression of the stories I read. It's a hobby that consumes a lot of time, because I insist on doing it all live. I literally put days into the preparation.  


I'm not aware of anyone else doing what I do. In essence, I carefully curate a selection of music, that I mix live, while telling the stories. It takes a lot of preparation, and a lot of focus and concentration to pull off.   
I realize, it may be terribly presumptuous of me too assume any of you would be interested, but I thought I'd share my new Youtube channel, with a selection of the readings I've done. They were all recorded live on-air, in one take, warts and all.  No post-production or editing. I've been told they have a kind of intimacy and authenticity that engages the listener for that very same reason.  


Let me underline, I do NOT make any profits from these. The videos are not monetized, I don't have any sponsors or put any ads. The ads that may pop up generate value for the copyright owners. The reason I do all is this because it's my passion. It's something I put a lot of time and energy into, because I love doing it. And I would love to expand the attention, beyond my regular listeners, that listen in when I do them live. More importantly: one of the pillars of this whole project is to share. Share the love of storytelling.  


So here I am sharing. I would be terribly thankful if you'd take the time to give this a listen.

"I've never read anything that felt so intricate and multilayered, and there was so much about the novel that I absolutely adored. The writing was beautiful, the characters were memorable, I loved the entire middle section and the whole Dead Dead Gang, and I really enjoyed how experimental Moore got in the third section. Lucia's chapter, while difficult to read, opened my eyes to the way language could be used and made me see words in a different way. There were times I could barely put the book down, and despite how long it was I got through it in about two weeks. I really can't fault Moore's technical ability as a writer.

(Spoiler warnings below)

But then, that Afterlude. God, it was bad. So, so, *so* very bad. It left a horrible taste in my mouth and I'm not sure if I even like the novel as a whole anymore. I went from seeing the novel as self-referential to seeing it as self-indulgent, naval-gazey, even masturbatory. It felt like Moore just wanted to show off how much work he put in, like ""remember that chapter? and remember when that happened?? and remember that part???"". YES, I remember it! I spent countless hours reading the goddamn thing! I don't need you to remind me of each individual chapter one by one! It's like he thinks he's so much smarter than everyone else that he can't trust the reader to come up with their own interpretation of what happened so he needs to hold our hand and walk us through it.

And there's so much in the actual novel that the Afterlude contradicts. If Michael remembered his experience in Mansoul and related it all to Alma, why was he so lost during the show? Why didn't any of the paintings ring a bell? And where the hell did Alma get the inspiration for all the paintings that referenced the chapters in the first and third sections? I realize that Moore gave himself a cop-out early on by stating that Alma would simply make up anything she needed to, but is the takeaway supposed to be that *everything* in the entire novel was just the product of Alma's drug-hazed mind? If that's the takeaway, then what was even the point? Again, it feels like Moore is just trying to show off.

I really wish the novel would have ended with Freddy Allen's redemption. That was the perfect ending and it would have been a beautiful story arc. The only thing in the entire Afterlude that was worthwhile was Benedict's poem, and that could have been written into one of the chapters in the third section.

There's so much more that I could say but I'm going to stop because I don't want to just sit here and complain. I really wish I could say that I loved the novel from start to finish. While I was in the middle of it I was already looking forward to rereading it, but now I doubt I'll ever pick it up again. Maybe one day I'll be ready to go back to it, but for now I just can't get over how much that Afterlude ruined the entire novel for me. I didn't watch Game of Thrones, but I'm aware of the final season's reception and now I feel like I can commiserate with those fans.

Maybe I missed something? Maybe I'm overlooking something that would redeem the novel? Unfortunately I don't know anyone in real life who's also read it so I have nobody to talk to. I'm left trying to sort through these feelings by myself, and I'm just coming up hurt and disappointed. Can anyone else offer their take?",books,3352

"Where do I even start? The beginning? That would be logical wouldn't it? Let's start there.

&gt;It was the¬†best¬†of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way ‚Äì in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.&lt;

We all know the starting paragraph. But honestly, I really didn't think much of it until I read the next two chapters, in which dickens elaborates further on his preliminary point which is *that it was the best of times for the rich whilst simultaneously being the worst time for the rich*

The story kicks off with Mr lorry being given a letter by his fellow messenger jerry. Mr lorry returns the letter immediately after discovering who is the sender and tells him to tell his lord one sentance which is: *Recalled to life*

Jerry, as puzzled as could be, goes back and Mr lorry goes on to schedule a meeting with a young lady who goes by the name *Lucie manette*

Miss Manette believes that her father had died during her early youth and knows her mother to have died when she herself was 2.

Mr lorry informs her that her father had been imprisoned for 17 (or 18 XD) years and that he needs her in order to *recall him to life*

I was never forced to read *A Tale Of Two Cities* as a child, and I am very thankful as most of the people I know did read it at school (involuntarily) loathed it as adults.

I've never really felt the same way I did reading this book with any other. It truly is, a work of art. My favourite character by far is sydney carton. The one who thinks he is useless. The one who thinks he will

&gt;""sink lower, and be worse:.&lt;

And the only one of them who provokes pity from the readers and for that he has truly won over my heart. His declaration of love for Lucie is by far one the best‚Äìand saddest‚Äìthings I've ever read. 

&gt;""No, Miss Manette; all through it, I have known myself to be quite undeserving. And yet I have had the weakness, and have still the weakness, to wish you to know with what a sudden mastery you kindled me, heap of ashes that I am, into fire‚Äîa fire, however, inseparable in its nature from myself, quickening nothing, lighting nothing, doing no service, idly burning away.""&lt;

And in the end he was the true hero of the Novel. 

I loved Lucie manette and her relationship with her father. I constantly felt really bad for Dr Manette after every relapse he had to go through and it's like non ending as well.

I would say, if you have a pre-existing opinion in mind about this book, or if it torments you in your dreams as it reminds of the days when you were forced to read, please give this book another try. Dickens' writing may seem a but repetitive and purple at times (or alot of the time) but trust me, once you get past the first book it starts getting alot better. It already starts improving after you've gotten all the world setting and whatnot out of the way which spans over around 2-3 chapters.

Thanks for reading.",books,3406

I was wondering if someone can suggest me a book where the story goes like this: a happy middle class family goes on a trip in a mini van to another far city for vacation. while on the road, they drive through a shady dense forest.

"Dark Forest in the second book in the ""Remembrance of Earth's Past"" trilogy. It covers the breakdown of human society when Earth is threatened by aliens. Faced by extermination at the hands of a technologically advanced civilization (Trisolaris), humans confront the harsh reality of the universe they live in.

Let us assume we find a technologically inferior civilization : ""Typhoons"". We have no way of bridging the gap between us, because of biological and cultural restrictions. if we assume the Typhoons are destructive, they must be destroyed for our sake. Even if we assume they're benevolent, the Typhoons have no way of knowing we're peaceful. So they too will try to destroy us in the future. This cycle repeats itself, which makes peace impossible.  

***Any spacefaring civilization must prioritize its own survival, and any alien civilization cannot be trusted to not exterminate your own civilization. Long interstellar distances make this suspicion impossible to dispel, so the best way to ensure one‚Äôs own survival is to stay silent (so as to remain undetected) and preemptively destroy any alien civilization one detects, akin to hunters stalking through a dark forest.*** 

And it's this reality, which helps humans avoid their fate, and bring an uneasy peace between Trisolaris and them.",books,1307

I was wondering if it would be more practical to simply stick double stick tape on the inside of the binding and attach it to the text block or if there's a special material or tape that allows this..I saw book binding tape but it looked to me impractical because the actual text block is not flat and there is a picture on either side of the first page and inside of cover that the binding tape would cover up.",books,643
"Many people know of Carl Sagan but I don‚Äôt think as many people realize the genius of his wife Ann Druyan who co-wrote the original COSMOS and many other books with Carl.

The sequel, COSMOS: Possible Worlds by Ann Druyan, just released this year and it couldn‚Äôt have been more timely for our present times. Her ability to break down complex scientific subjects while filling you with awe and inspiration is unmatched by anyone else I have ever read. With negativity surrounding our world being filled with hope for a better future is really more valuable than we appreciate. 

One thing I appreciate most about Ann and Carl is there willingness to speak for the truth, bringing to light stories that need to be told and played a crucial role in human history. I had briefly heard of Nikolai Vavilov but Possible Worlds tells the story better than I have ever heard. (The TV episode was also phenomenal and has one of my favorite actors Viggo Mortensen)

Right from the start the prologue cuts deep and gives you an idea of what the true purpose of COSMOS really is. She quotes Einstein saying ‚ÄúIf science, like art, is to perform its mission truly and fully, its achievements must enter not only superficially but with their inner meaning into the consciousness of the people.‚Äù 

I am left feeling that this book isn‚Äôt just something we put down and forget about. It‚Äôs something we are all a part of and actively writing together as our story goes on.

If you are already a fan I can‚Äôt recommend COSMOS: Possible Worlds enough and know you won‚Äôt be disappointed. Other books such as ‚ÄúThe Demon-Haunted World‚Äù or ‚ÄúShadows of Forgotten Ancestors‚Äù are my personal favorites but you can‚Äôt go wrong with any of their books.",books,1719

But yeah, I showed enough signs as a child to get tested at 12 (my parents never told me the results but that's a whole other can of worms) and while I'm successful enough at uni and holding down an internship, I do still struggle at some things.

And one of my main problem areas is reading. Like, I have weeks where I can read through a 350-physical-pages book in 2-3 days without a problem, and I have weeks where even though I'm utterly in love with it, I just can't stay focused on that book.

Worm by John McCrae is an absolute masterpiece, excellent writing, the plot thoroughly grips you and the world building built up by the end is enormous.
Worm is very long, 600,000 words longer than the entire Harry Potter series combined, so if you want to give it a read, be prepared for a long haul.

McCrae's first novel, Worm features a bullied teenage girl, Taylor Hebert, who develops the superpower to control worms, insects, arachnids and other simple lifeforms. Using a combination of ingenuity, idealism, and brutality, she struggles to do the right thing in a dark world filled with moral ambiguity.
I don‚Äôt want to give any major spoilers but what I can say is that the world of Worm is depressing, grim dark and very gut wrenching, Worm is not suitable for immature or younger audiences.

"Just read book 2 of a novel I read a while back which I absolutely adored. One of the best books I've ever read, not even exaggerating. A breath of fresh air.

Then book 2 came out. It's bad. Like...*really* bad. Almost unrecognizable. I'm super bummed out. And there is going to be a third book. And strange as it sounds, I'm 100% confident book 3 will be better than book 2.

Why? Because I've seen this SO MANY times. Great book 1, but the writer is obsessed with making it a trilogy, because that's what so many other writers are doing. So you get a book 2 were very little of note actually happens. The writer needs to fill up space so it can become a proper trilogy. And it's nothing like book 1 which you loved so much. But then book 3 is all fire and lighting, because everything gets squeezed into it for a climactic ending.

There is no shame in having a series be 2 books. And if you have a story that has so much to tell it needs to be 3 or more books, by all means. Just don't make it a trilogy for the sake of it being a trilogy, because readers will notice very fast that it actually shouldn't be 3 books content-wise.",books,1133
"After reading all the good things about him on this sub, I picked up The Final Empire because the synopsis intrigued me and it seemed like a good place to start. Seeing all the 5-star reviews on Goodreads and the overall score, I went in with high expectations. My conclusion after finishing the book is that it's underwhelming and over hyped. 

The language was repetitive and the conversations were just plain bad. Vin's italicized inner thoughts stating the obvious were so unnecessary. Breeze talking to himself while he did the Soothing near the end is another example of bad dialogues. I did find myself chuckling at the crew's banter but that was about the only good thing.

The magic system or Allomancy seemed interesting at the beginning. It was innovative. Pushing and Pulling and the various metals involed. But the conclusion sucked. The established rules were just thrown away at the end there. It was such an anti-climatic finale. It left me with a big gaping hole in an obviously bad way.

Characters. Cliches. All of them. Felt like I was reading a bad YA novel. None of the characters had any real depth to them past the established cliches. Take Elend for instance. He's quirky because he *reads* during balls? And Vin falls for him because he's different and cared about the skaa? He can be the new ruler because ""his reading had changed him?"" What a joke. Lord Ruler was mentioned so many times in such a menacing way and he wasn't even introduced in the book till the last 100 or so pages. Kelsier, Vin, Breeze, Ham, Spook, all of them are just types without any individual personality or real character growth. 

The Plot. There are so many things wrong with the plot that I don't even want to list them down. Lord Ruler ruled for a thousand years and his empire was destroyed by a thieving crew? In less than year? It can happen, yes but the execution was so godawful. Did the established institutions do such a bad job at handling the empire? Every one meets one evening and  they put a haphazard plan together. The plan has a few setbacks but lo and behold they all succeed in the end because Kelsier had a hidden plan all along. Why were the Renoux family servants being taken to be executed if Marsh hadn't been tortured into giving the information away? (can someone clear this up?) And where the frick did Elend come from in that ruckus?

Conclusion. Please give me my week back. I am not saying it was a completely bad book. It did a few things well and I probably would've liked it if I was 15. I will probably try another Sanderson because I do not want to dismiss him as a bad writer but he did write a pretty bad book. However, I will not continue with the Mistborn series and will take me a long time gather the courage to pick up another Sanderson.",books,2785

"Early in December, the week before I went back to America after a three-month holiday in Australia (my homeland), I went into a bookshop and grabbed something small for the plane(s) home.  It ended up being We Have Always Lived in a Castle by Shirley Jackson, one of the little orange and white Penguin editions.  I didn't read on the plane because I was crying too hard and then I  watched Psycho to cheer myself up and forgot about the book.  Finally, yesterday, I read it.  It turned out to be American Gothic literature.   

I have never read anything so unapologetically macabre and mystical.  As I cracked the spine the first time, I was determined to become invested in the main character, Merricat, who is writing the story from her perspective.  She lives alone with her sister Constance - and six years prior all their family members were poisoned.  Early on in the story, it becomes very clear to the reader who the murderer is.  It is Merricat.  And Constance knew about it.  So the story is not a mystery, nor about a murderer being brought to justice, as I supposed at first.  

Throughout the story, Merricat continually practices rustic witchcraft to protect her and her sister from outside perils.  Although eighteen years old, Merricat sees the future as if only six years old, a golden continuation of her present paradise, replete with delicious food and days in the garden.  She never looks back to the dark time six years prior, when everyone died.  She dreams of destroying the people that mistreat her and her sister.  Violence makes her content.  Food makes her feel secure.  Her sister makes her feel love.  Her family....makes her feel nothing at all.  And that made me wonder, did she and her sister actually plan the death of the family?  The two of them, together?  To what end?  Paradise.  Food.  Life exactly as Merricat wants it, with the family member she did not want dead.  And finally, after certain hurdles and catastrophes, Merricat gets her happy ending.  And I was relieved.  And disgusted.  I noticed that, even as I became more and more alarmed at her characteristics as the story unfolded, I felt a sadness at Merricat's woes and contentment at her joys.  Here was a story about a sociopath who sacrified her parents so she could live happily ever after, and she never felt a twinge of guilt. And here was I almost relieved that she lived happily ever after.  

I dislike American Gothic literature.  It makes me sympathetic to all the things that people get sent to prison for, like poisoning your parents.",books,2551
"I had seen many discussions about the dystopian nature of Brave New World, so I decided to read it. After finishing the book, I seem to have a different interpretation of the  of the book.  I did not get the: authorities using happiness and complacency to control the society vibe. There is not really an authoritative state where the high class ""benefits"". The authority figures (Controllers and Alphas) do not particularly benefit from the way the society is managed. No one is being exploited in the traditional sense as the lower class is built, literally, to allow the caste system of the society to provide stability. The lower class is not suffering.

For me, one of the biggest questions the book presents is: Is Mustapha right? Over time, the Controllers have designed a system that provides happiness (or pleasure) to all of its members and remains stable. Being an exaggeration, this system is taken to a theoretical limit. Many things, such as freedom, are sacrificed for the sake of furthering their goal.  The Savage provides a foil. To him, the ""happiness"" of Mustapha's society seems absurd and shallow. He believes that misery and pain are the only path to happiness. Ultimately Mustapha refutes the Savage's ideas.  From their discourse, it appears that Mustapha (and his predecessors) have decided that this system is the logical solution to creating a happy society. 

Maybe they are wrong? Does the goal of providing happiness to all result in the sacrifice of freedoms? Is there another way? Is a free society with no disease or suffering possible? I think that these are important questions that the book presents. What does everyone else think?",books,1668

The first one, ‚ÄúInsomnia‚Äù. Man, I loved this book even without reading the dark tower series beforehand. I thought it was vivid, evenly paced, and moving. I loved the characters and the paranormal stuff and the classic good vs. evil.

The second, ‚ÄúDuma Key‚Äù. I think this one more than ‚ÄúInsomnia‚Äù I am surprised by the hate for. It is a different book for sure but it still has the suspense, and the pacing that any King fan loves. 


The third, ‚ÄúGeralds Game‚Äù. While I will admit I read this a very long time ago when I was a teenager, and maybe I just thought the sex and violence was edgy but I do remember loving the page-turning excitement of this book.

"I know Lolita has gotten plenty of attention on this sub in recent months but I don‚Äôt wish to retread previous discussions of whether it could be written today and related themes.

Like others, this text has made its way into my quarantine reading list but I was surprised to find that my public library does not have a copy. 

For context, my town is home to one of the most prestigious prep schools in the country and because of this, academia is deeply embedded in our otherwise small community. Many notable authors have emerged from or written about their time in our town. We have an annual literature festival to prove how proud we are of this.

I am wondering if others, in communities like mine or elsewhere, struggled to find a copy locally at libraries or brick and mortar bookstores. Where most readers can discern that Nabokov is neither glorifying nor romancing HH‚Äôs thoughts and actions, I did not anticipate that a library that carries every other canonical text would purposefully omit this novel due to the stigma surrounding it.",books,1047
"[Link](https://youtu.be/cKlGQfvj5_g)

One of my favorite scenes from this show. For context, this character has gone through a lot of change up until this point and so he's participating in a book club where they are talking about the Great Gatsby and the meaning of second chances. They're in prison so he's referring to himself and others while the writers of the show also mean the criminal justice system in general. In addition to himself, D'Angelo is talking about a specific person when he brings up the book collection analogy and how we can dress ourselves up with a ton of books to make ourselves look different, but it doesn't mean much if they're just sitting there as decorations. 

I highly recommend watching the series if you've never seen it.",books,759
"I read it a few months ago, but I felt compelled to re-read it. Koestler is simply a genius. As an ex-Marxist I think the way in which he explains the Marxist theory of history and society through the medium of Rubashov and other characters is simply exquisite and uncannily accurate. Rubashov is a man who wants to oppose the regime he brought into being as an aberration from the ideal they sought to attain, but because he is fighting on the same ideological terrain as his opponents - the terrain of Marxist theory and philosophy - he is browbeaten through purely rational argument into accepting that he is wrong, and that the party is right. He suppresses his conscience - his 'grammatical fiction' - as the expression of a petty-bourgeois attitude towards life, which can only be properly grasped and understood through Marxist 'science'. He battles with the ghosts of his past, of all the people he has betrayed and sacrificed to the ideal of revolutionary socialism - Richard, Little Loewy, Arlova -  and is only able to find peace when he finally convinces himself that he was absolutely correct after all, and that, in seeking to repudiate these deeds and overthrow the regime, he has marked himself out as worthy of death. He convinces himself that he is worthless, that his death is a mere 'shrug of eternity', and that the dialectic of history is fully entitled to ride over his broken corpse. It is the story of how dogma, cultism and absolute, fanatical loyalty to a false ideal can lead one to immolate himself, all for no good purpose. I nearly ended up like Rubashov. Thank goodness I escaped.",books,1612

"What Story or book gives you a feeling of safety and warmth?

For me it has to be ""The Time Traveler"" by HG Wells. The Main Story of the book is told as a story by the time traveler by the fire, surrounded by his friends. Even tho the story is dark at times, you always know that in the end he will be safe back at home telling the story. This just conveys a feeling of warmth and cozyness for me",books,396
"The book might be considered YA with sci-fi/fantasy elements.  There was also a heavy societal commentary arc built in, as well, so I‚Äôm not sure how to qualify this book at the moment. 
I read this book in the late 80‚Äôs, and I have a vague idea/memory that it was older than that- perhaps written in the 60‚Äôs or 70‚Äôs?

What I remember is this:

The book had to do with stairs. An entire room/space filled with nothing but stairs; no rooms, no hallways, but stairs in every direction. A group of pre-/teens are mysteriously delivered to this ‚Äúhouse of stairs‚Äù with no memories of anything outside this space.  They climb and descend stairs and interact with each other. 

They find a device which they eventually learn delivers food when certain lights on the device are lit and they perform a certain task or movement.   Over time, they become conditioned to respond to the device unconsciously. 

I have a memory of some kind of threat which they have to continuously escape or prepare to fight, but for the life of me, I can‚Äôt remember what specifically that threat was described as. 

The group eventually are released/escape from this prison, and demonstrate their conditioned responses (they are at a crosswalk and then the lights change they begin their movements/actions to prompt food, etc) to the outside world.  And the book ended. 

I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs more to this book than what I‚Äôve described, but this is what I remember, going on thirty years later.  It‚Äôs bothered me for years that I can‚Äôt remember the name of this book which I LOVED at the time!!! 

Does this at all sound familiar to anyone? I‚Äôd love to find this book again and reread it as an adult.   I‚Äôm very grateful for any help someone can provide.
Thank you, friends!",books,1742
"I have been thinking about what ""makes a good book"" and how subjective it is.
For example, my favourite genre is science fiction and my favourite book is Sirens of Titan by Kurt Vonnegut. However, there are many renowned science fiction books that I just didn't enjoy.

One of the most important qualities for me is the ""voice"" of the book. A good voice is what makes me enjoy the book. 
For example, I can fully recognize the greatness of Dune but I just couldn't get into the voice which made it unemployable to read 600 pages (although I am so impressed by the world building).

I also really care about characters, their motives and their development. 

I think this is an interesting topic because this is what makes book ratings so subjective. As another example, I love Becky Chambers Wayfarers series. A valid criticism of her books is that nothing happens, but for me, I love her writing voice and characters so much that the plot is not as important.

So what are your favourite books and what aspects of them stand out to you? Are there any books you disliked reading but still think are 'good'?",books,1106

"Hello, hope you are all well today.

Just wanted to start off saying that I came across the movie on Netflix, really enjoy it. Found out it was a book and I just had to read it!

I had seen the criticism that they were nothing alike, while this is somewhat true, they each represented pop culture.

Had the movie been like the book, there would‚Äôve been too many obscure references that regular audiences wouldn‚Äôt get.

So, yeah, the movie holds its pop culture closer to what would be recognizable to the average human with little knowledge of the 80s.

I came into the book honestly not knowing what to expect because of the bad reviews. I‚Äôm glad I read it, it turned out to be a great book.

I can see why a lot of the book‚Äôs content didn‚Äôt make it into the movie, but it was really fun to see how the movie used the book. There was a lot of stuff mentioned in the book that I was familiar with, I guess I know more about the 80s than I thought! However, I could see how some of the references in book would be lost to the average person in the film. 

I like both equally for what they are.

The book was fun to read. I kept finding myself excited to see how the story would play out. I even enjoyed Wade in the book too. Even the other characters from the High Five were better. More rich,  better storylines. I was glad to see that the book was really progressive thinking, challenging modern ideology and culture.

After finishing the book, it made me love the movie all over again. They compliment each other so well, imo.

Some of the book was a bit wordy, but nothing unbearable, if I had to make a complaint.

Just wanted to hear other‚Äôs thoughts in the comment section :)

"Every time when I am trying to learn any topic through books, I am looking for books‚Äô selections that can help me to handle a topic and every time I encounter the same problems:

1. The majority of books‚Äô selections is subjective
2. In order to make them objective, I should spend a bunch of time on analyzing a lot of selections, on searching the best books on the selections, on understanding why should I read the book and where I can apply what I read, and finally - reading a huge number of reviews - all these steps take me several hours to complete.
3. If I do not make them objective, I often waste money and time on shitty books.

I asked my friends, and do you know what? Of course, you know what, they have the same problems.

Therefore, I decided to create an app that can help me, my friends, and other people, who want to get structured and modern knowledge using the books.

The app brings together the best books. They are all organized by topics. Also, each book has a structured description to help you understand what is in the book and why to read it.

Why is it objective???

Our team analyzes information from all over the internet. Dozens of articles, videos, hundreds of reviews, plenty of conversations with professionals on forums. Thus, you get the most objective books‚Äô selections.

**If you like the idea ‚Äì  write here or dm me, I will share the link**, so you can download the app and try it, maybe you will find something useful for yourself.

"Warning: Contains Spoilers!

I just finished this novel last night. It was gripping and scary and uncomfortable. I'm honestly not sure how I felt about the ending. On one hand, I'm happy that Melissa still has her family, since she came from the orphanage, but my heart breaks for the families of Iris, Daisy and Dahlia, and of course Edelweiss and Rick.

It was made perfectly clear throughout the novel that the girls had lived in the desert since they were born (or rather, kidnapped). Melissa talks about how they have never been any farther than town. I am confused by how Elmer and Rose went about getting the babies. I don't think they would have felt comfortable to leave the girls alone for what would have been a few days' journey each time, and I also don't think that they would have brought somebody in to watch the girls. Did they pack up the kids and take them along? If so, Iris and Melissa would have had some memories of the trip to get the twins. They would have been 10 and 7 at that time.

Knowing that this novel was written by an adult male, did anybody else find the physical descriptions of the teenage Iris somewhat ... unsettling? I found myself skimming some of those parts, because they were uncomfortable to read about as an adult woman.

One last thing on my mind is: did the novel ever mention how Edelweiss died? I know at one point, Rick questioned Rose and Elmer about if they had killed her, and they became obviously upset at the accusations. But, I don't remember reading about what actually happened.

I'm sure that there are other people in this group who have read Desert Flowers. I would love to discuss this novel with you!",books,1666
"I think my two choices would be Joseph Conrad and William Golding. I thought about this recently when I compared their writing styles and their heavy usage of imagery and setting to create mood and to bolster character development. 

It seems to my untrained and novice eye that Golding and Conrad lean heavily on atmosphere, and in their two most famous books it works out wonders. 

In Lord of the Flies in Chapters 5 and 6, when the boys lose the island fire and the parachutist falls from the sky during a night time dog fight, Golding paints the island in the macabre and uses some of the visual impressionism from the Dadaists and the Surrealist movement -- gaping mouths, flashes of the eyes, dark shapes moving against white backgrounds and sunlit stunning glare in a world of mirages and hidden figures. It really puts you in the mindset of the boys, who are freaking out and losing hold of their societal upbringing. 

In Heart of Darkness, right from the onset, in Chapter 1, Conrad paints a foreboding and foreshadowing picture of the Thames and overcast skies and the heaviness of the atmosphere. You are certain that any voyages that this boat has taken has led it to even darker waters. 

I'm not sure why the visual is so powerful in literature or if even I am a minority for feeling like I can ""see"" feelings in the imagery and setting. Perhaps it's because I was raised on the poetry of Ezra Pound, T.S. Eliot, Wallace Stevens, Elizabeth Bishop and the modernists and imagists, like William Carlos Williams. I'd like to ask these two gents to talk about imagery and setting and what influenced them to think of the human condition in terms of nature, or landscape. 

Perhaps for Golding it has something to do with being British. If you ever go to the British Museum or the other art museums, British portraiture and painting tells a fable as old as time in landscape art. Anyway, I think I've made my point, but this is what I would ask these two if they sat down for an interview with me.",books,2008

"Firstly, r/books is a boon for book readers. I've received many good suggestions from this subreddit, and also r/suggestmeabook and r/booksuggestions, which is why I keep coming back here to read good reviews about books I plan to start next.

About 20 days ago, I decided to read *Wolf Hall* by Hilary Mantel. Although I've been familiar with the name for a very long time, I did not have the slightest idea what it was about. Only after i read *The Hollow Crown* by Dan Jones and watched a video of Henry VIII by Oversimplified on YouTube did I realise who Thomas Cromwell was. Added to that, this year the last book of her Thomas Cromwell trilogy, *The Mirror and the Light* released, so I thought, why not?

For those of you are in the dark, Henry VIII was one of the most prominent kings in the short history of the Tudor bloodline. Not only that, he is the only king known to become the Head of the Church to marry another woman (Anne Boleyn). He had six wives, by the way. [Here](https://youtu.be/ewLpXw6uN28) is the link to the Oversimplified video for a better understanding.

Now the review.

*Wolf Hall* is the produce of a secondary text. By secondary text, I mean that a reader cannot start reading this book without some prior knowledge for a better understanding of the plot.

This book is divided into six parts. Each part shows Thomas's escalation from a blacksmith's son in Putney to the Master Secretary of the court of king Henry VIII. Although the first chapter of the part one gives us a glimpse on a supposedly fictional childhood of Thomas, it is but a drop of the vast ocean of chapters coming right ahead. 

The narration is *in medias res* with two principle events laying their foundations, the fall of Cardinal Thomas Wolsey as the Chancellor, and the rise of Anne Boleyn from a Marquess to the second Queen to Henry. Although his biography, Cromwell, for the most part plays the role of a viewer, a listener alongside the reader to give a taste of what England was like in those days. The shift of power, from Catholicism to Protestantism; the forbidden influence of William Tyndale's translation of the Gospels and against all past prejudices, show another side to the Cromwell who was previously believed as ruthless and shrewd man of power.

Hilary Mantel spent 5 years to write this book. From Wikipedia,
&gt; Mantel said she spent five years researching and writing the book, trying to match her fiction to the historical record. To avoid contradicting history, she created a card catalogue, organised alphabetically by character, with each card containing notes indicating where a particular historical figure was on relevant dates. ""You really need to know, where is the Duke of Suffolk at the moment? You can't have him in London if he's supposed to be somewhere else"", she explained.

Honestly it was a very tiresome read; to keep up with waves of overwhelming facts and characters, but once I finished reading the last page, I found it very rewarding. Will start *Bring Up the Bodies* soon.

Are those data true or fake? 

To me its a bit strange that top books rankings sell only 20k copies (per book).

&amp;#x200B;

Where you can find some useful data? For Manga we have oricon and many websites that translate numbers. For books?",books,417
"The other day, a friend was reading wings of fire and she told me that there was a water dragon and rain dragon. Then why the hell is the book called wings of fire cuz literally that is something completely the opposite of FIRE üî•. Also, I‚Äôm not making fun of the author (her books are actually quite good), but her name is Tui. T. Sutherland. I kinda giggled when I said it out loud. ‚ÄòSo the author is Twit Sutherland?‚Äô But I said I‚Äôm just joking so she (my friend, not Twit Sutherland lol) wouldn‚Äôt get upset.",books,510
"I read this book a few years back and haven't been able to remember the name at all. 

It was a softball player that went through a hard time in life and stress ate so much to the point of gaining a lot of weight.  Her parents separated and life just got worse. 

She had a sister which helped her throughout the book. A strong supporting character.

She keeps on gaining weight and being bullied which in turn makes her feel worse. The ending was her rethinking about her life and getting to the point of killing herself.  The last sentence was cut short as she was dead. 

Please please please help me find this book!",books,619
"Hi all!

I always try to read books on their original language, so most of the authors I read are either British/American or from my own country.

I feel like the translation, no matter how good, simply cant grasp the whole structure and the beauty of the original content.
I am a big fan of Middle Eastern novels/poetry and I feel that I am missing out on those details.

What are your thoughts about it?",books,405
"Isn't it a total wonder how a beautiful whole can arise from otherwise ordinary, separate parts‚Äîtake for example the human body, a tree, or a book? Well, The Overstory was the exact opposite of that. Zoom in on the story's pieces and you'll find them beautiful, but zoom out and you'll find the story somehow ordinary‚Äîjust trees and life for 9 people. They get born, grow, study, drop out, become professionals, join rallies, become felons, die, go to prison, while the trees, they grow through it just by being still. 

My initial reception of this book was tepid. But after rereading Seeds, the last chapter, it all fell into place for me. Here‚Äôs how:

Pros:

1. Prose

Well, what can I say? The man is a geek who writes beautiful prose. Back in high school, I hated Biology because we were basically taught to memorize terms. If he had been my Bio teacher, I‚Äôm sure I would have appreciated Bio more. I mean, just look at him talk about photosynthesis:

‚ÄúThey will grasp how a leaf of grass encodes the journeywork of the stars. In a few short seasons, simply by placing billions of pages of data side by side, the next new species will learn to translate between any human language and the language of green things.‚Äù

2. Research

Powers really knows his stuff, he must have researched the hell out for this book. 
However, what impressed me was not that he knew stuff, but that he was able to use those to propose a bold idea. E.g.: 

I am an actuarial student with some knowledge on data science. When I was reading Seeds, I could see that Neelay‚Äôs learners were basically AI. Today, AI has been improved tremendously by a thing called machine learning (ML). Basically, ML is 

1. hunting for patterns in past data,
2. training your program to use those patterns to predict outcomes on a new set of data (aka the training set),
3. and then deploying the bot, i.e. the program, for prod.

In Seeds, this question was introduced: What does life want from humans? Does it want us to save the trees? Or do we just stand still and let evolution do its thing? The GRAND IDEA was that the answer may lie somewhere in Earth‚Äôs history. And so Neelay deployed his learners to scour the universe of data the earth has generated from time zero to present, to learn everything there is to learn, in hopes that somewhere down the line, the answer lies waiting, all this time, sitting out 4.5 billion bustling years for that exact moment, to be discovered.

Cool, right? 

3. Structure

But this is even cooler: The book is structured like a tree!

Roots / Emergence: We are introduced to the individual origins of the characters. 
Trunk / Convergence: The characters converge to a shared purpose‚Äîthe fight to save trees.
Crown / Divergence: They part ways after Olivia‚Äôs death.
Seeds / Resurgence: Olivia‚Äôs life mission is continued by another set of 5 people, Nick and 4 others. For me, this seems to be a homage to the OG 5 which reinforces the ‚Äòcycle‚Äô theme: life goes on. And the trees seem to know this, hence, Nick‚Äôs STILL in the north and Olivia‚Äôs
 
‚ÄúThis. What we have been given. What we must earn. This will never end.‚Äù

4. Message

My takeaway from this novel is how humans have come to understand so little about trees, or the world in general, despite having come so far in the pursuit of knowledge‚Äîscience, math, philosophy, etc. We have misunderstood that trees need saving, when it is really us who need it. 

Powers delivered this message thru the tragedy that is Olivia‚Äôs story and the epiphany in Nick‚Äôs  story.

Olivia during her last moments: ‚ÄúSomething‚Äôs wrong. I‚Äôve been shown what happens, and this isn‚Äôt it.‚Äù

Nick in the North: ‚ÄúFrom nowhere, in a heartbeat, Nick understands what Maidenhair‚Äôs voices must always have meant. The most wondrous products of four billion years of life need help.
Not them; us. Help from all quarters.‚Äù

But I still have some reservations about this. Do we really not know it is us who need to be saved? In Patricia‚Äôs keynote speech, she tells how Noah failed to take the trees aboard his ark. Maybe that was why Noah didn‚Äôt save them, because they didn‚Äôt need it in the first place. It was us‚Äîhas always been us‚Äîwho needed saving. So maybe we have known all this time, albeit unconsciously. After all, is it not that some humans believe trees need saving because by doing so, we are saving ourselves? Because we need the oxygen, wood, shade, food, chemicals, and so much more that trees give. Because, in our eyes, trees are mere goods for our consumption and we never really saw past that. Because humans fail to see past ourselves.

Cons:

1. I'd have to agree with some people that the book became dragging in Trunk. But come to think of it, maybe Powers purposely did that to reflect the length and volume the trunk gives to a tree? While you're at it, did you also notice how 'tiny' Seeds is? ;)

2. The hypocrisy of talking about saving trees in a book made from them. Fortunately, Powers was keen enough to address this thru Patricia.

I‚Äôve said a lot of things, but if I could sum it all up in a sentence, it‚Äôd be like this: This book is literally and figuratively a tree, a wonderful creation! 

And maybe that‚Äôs why pages are called leaves‚Äîfor the trees, in memoriam.",books,5225

"I don‚Äôt even know what to feel right now, but I think I am sad. I loved the book, I loved the story. I loved characters so much. It illustrates, rather painfully, the cruelty of the west and it‚Äôs dangers. But I was disappointed by the ending. I felt that there were so many loose strings to tie up and it ended quite sadly without much resolution. McMurty made no effort for character arcs in most cases, specifically Captain Call‚Äôs. He‚Äôs painfully human, and stubborn and ashamed to the very end, though true to himself I guess. The lack of character development seems on the whole a good capture of humanity, especially in such a time as post-civil war Wild West. It was such a struggle just to survive. But it is by no means a happy ending and after reading 843 pages of these characters and their lives, it‚Äôs hard to feel satisfied with so little. Yet I suppose that in itself encapsulates the very nature of the book and it‚Äôs setting. 

I have the mini series, and I was anxious to finish the book and watch it but now that I‚Äôve finished it, I‚Äôm not so sure. I feel too sad. I feel like I have to heal a bit before watching them go through it all again. 

I know that there are more books in the series, prequels and sequels, but from what I‚Äôve read, they seem to deviate quite a bit from the original. I accidentally read one spoiler and it struck me as so far out of line for the character‚Äôs identity in the original that I‚Äôve lost some of my appetite to keep reading the series. Anyone read the other books? Are they worth it?",books,1534

I love E.M. Forster but most people seem to only have read A Passage to India and I never have met anyone who read his other books.

"I don't know how else to explain it, but I recently bought the Barnes and Nobles Classics Edition of Withering Heights (first time reading) and I swear the first 40 pages are background about Emily Bront√´ and a forward from her sister and a letter from her editor and a family tree of her family and a timeline of her life. 

Sweet beans. Chill. 

Then I finally get to the story and it's got little footnotes for almost every single page. And what do those  footnotes hold? Pretty much a Cliffnotes version of this story in the back directory.

If I wanted a biography of Ms. Bront√´, I would have bought such a book specifically. If I wanted a Cliffnotes version of the story, I would have looked for that specifically.

I know this is nitpicking, but I feel like it's taking away from my active reading of the story 'on my own' because of how much intrusion from other things there are.

I should have skimmed the book before I bought it, but I was so excited to read it that I didn't even notice.

"I am trying to read more non-fiction books now and heard about Malcolm Gladwell, and among his books, the most famous one seems to be 'David and Goliath'. I read the book and I have mixed feelings about it. It's not a bad book, but not great either.

The book is supposed to be about underdogs and how people at disadvantage and at unfavourable circumstances fight against the odds to succeed. But the examples and stories seem to be way too many than actually required. And many stories seem to be about men taking risk and following their instincts and succeeding, which doesn't seem to me a good fit for the book (I might be wrong, but some felt out of place).

Then some stories are about social psychology, like the apt teacher to student ratio in a class, local police trying to reconcile with a tough neighbourhood.

All these stories are great and interesting, but they seemed incoherent and out of place for the theme of the book.

I still intend to read more of Gladwell's books, and I hope they are better than this book.",books,1032

"I get the price would sky-rocket, but I think of all literary genres, poetry is the most reliant on cultural aspects and especially linguistic ones.

Translating poetry must be one of the hardest things to do. I remember this anecdote my literature teacher told us, about this Hispanic-Chinese woman (Marcela de Juan) who translated Ancient Chinese poems into Spanish by using Medieval Spanish vocabulary and I remember it being a hugely different experience. Translated poetry almost acts as a different version to the original poem itself, and there's something beautiful and odd about it.

The story talks about his previous actions for the Soviet Union whether it be getting Belgian communists arrested who weren‚Äôt allowing guns to the Italians in Ethiopia or setting up a rogue German communist to the German authorities. 

I believe eventually he is killed and it shows themes like the aggressiveness of the new generation and the prison using the anguish of other prisoners to try to break the main character‚Äôs resolve. His old friend who was the Warden or main guy is killed by the authorities. I think the title had something to do with Midnight or Dawn.

"I am writing a reading tracker app for Android, and I'm looking to get ideas from the community for features you would want implemented in this kind of app.  I have used several different ones in the past, and I found that there weren't very many options that did most of what I wanted, and none that did it all, so I decided to make my own.

As it stands, you can:

*  Time your reading sessions and create reading logs from them
* View all your in-progress books and stats about them (page count, author, publisher, your start and finish date, etc)
* Set a goal for when you'd like to finish a book, and see your progress and reading pace, along with projected finish date in real time.
* Set daily reading goals in pages or minutes, and track your progress
* Add books to a Want to Read list, and view them, along with your finished and quit (DNF-d) books in a collection

I am planning to implement in the near future:

* Achievements/badges for milestones, or other fun things
* Statistics and personal records (most pages read in a day, longest book read, etc)
* Daily goal notifications (optional)
* Yearly and monthly reading goals

&amp;#x200B;

Long term goals include some sort of Discover tab that would allow you to get recommendations based on what you've read in the past, or maybe what other people that use the app are reading.  And of course, dark mode.  


What other features would you like to see in a reading tracker app?  Are there any things in apps you've used in the past that you didn't like?  I'd love to hear feedback, as I'm having a blast working on this, and would like to release it some time this year.

"Basically having a kindle and libby at my disposal has made my ability to finish a book plummet. 

I started this year with the goal of reading more, and I've actually finished two books this year which is more than I have in the past five (plus) years! However, I've started and not completed over 10 books at this point. I enjoyed most of the books too, it just seems to be difficult to make reading into a constant habit. I used to be a voracious reader growing up and I do tend to get obsessively into books. It seems to be very everything or nothing, and I seem to be able to binge nonfiction a lot easier. 

When I was growing up I remember there was one fiction book that I tried to read for at least 3 summers! I eventually gave up and got the audiobook (on cassette tape) and that was my first time finishing it. It quickly became my favorite book but I'm worried this bad habit or style has followed me into adulthood.

I‚Äôve only read 3 total books, but I‚Äôve wanted to read hundreds, I just can never find the motivation to sit down and read instead of doing anything else that seems less stagnant. 

I‚Äôd choose to play Star Wars: Battlefront II over reading, or I‚Äôd just do whatever else over reading because the idea of sitting down and just reading is unappealing, even though I love books and I‚Äôd love to read again.

From the ungrateful ness to the bratty attitude and her acting like she was to good for anything, I just wanted to put her somewhere and not have to deal with her anymore. I thought things were maybe getting figured out in book one and maybe her and the MC could have a relationship together when Freya went to the castle and told Nesta the truth (oh yeah and Freya legit gave them a castle and Nesta still had the gall to act like she payed for it and dicatated who could go where when the queen stuff came up but I guess they do live there and would have to deal with whatever happened so it kinda makes sense) but nope, right back to normal. In the third book when her and elisha came to live in the secret city, I tried to push on and get through her bit but I literally couldn‚Äôt and had to sit the book down. This was weeks ago and I haven‚Äôt been able to pick it back up. I know Freyas not completely innocent with her dragging them into the darker world (even tho that only happened because she was trying to catch food and make money for the fam unlike Nesta) but Nesta has been a b*tch from day one even tho Freya did everything for them and Nesta just sat on her butt and took advantage. And let‚Äôs not even talk about who Nestas love interest is looking to be. He‚Äôs way to good for her. I thought we were finally gonna have someone to tell Nesta the truth about awful she was when he gave her the verbal smack down but nope just some runny tears from her and he‚Äôs fallen in love. Yay. Anyways I came on here to beg someone to list me some redeeming qualities of hers other then her taking care of Elisha. I really wanna pick the book back up and finish the series but she‚Äôs stopping me. Okay sorry for the rant, and pls help. Thanks!",books,2064

"This book was like having someone fill your glass painstakingly slow and about 3/4  of the way accelerating, to the point where the glass is full to the brim with liquid spilling over the edge. It started out real slow and felt like your run-of-the-mill gothic-esque thriller, and then towards the end it ventured out to the wildest revelations and twists. It made me go wtf. It didn't make sense at all. And to add fuel to that fire the author just dumped more and more nonsensical reveals that it started to feel more gratuitous than having any impact on the story.

I didn't react to horrifying scenes the way i was expected to react to them because of my inability to connect with the characters as well as the way it was written. 

Overall it just felt weird.

"I‚Äôve decided to finish my summer by reading the Isherwood classic that started it all. While I was reading it, I couldn‚Äôt help but feel a sense of certain doom the entire time reading the story. From Berlin to Sally Bowles, this story has been warped and shaped in so many forms that reading the actual base text was such a mental roller coaster. For Berlin, we all know what happened in real life in the 1930‚Äôs. Every interaction with a Launder like Natalia or Bernhard, who are at the height of their wealth and life is clouded by a sense of doom and sorry. Unless you live under a rock, everyone has heard of Cabaret and the ill fated Sally Bowles being born in the wrong time trying to make something of herself. She‚Äôs fun on the surface, and a delightful character with her lines of ‚Äòsimply marvelous‚Äô tales and green nail polish. Yet Sally‚Äôs world crumbles and her dreams are crushed. Isherwood wrote it all down. There‚Äôs also Otto and Peter, a strange dynamic in the book which felt very suppressed considering the time period, and Isherwood‚Äôs own perception of that while also being closeted. 

Anyway this is just my opinion on the book. I strongly suggest the read to anyone interested in the time period, or anyone looking for characters who pop and stick out.",books,1271
"Firstly, I‚Äôd like to point out that I‚Äôm still learning English, and if my grammar is a little messed up, thats my reason.

And secondly, I am a teenager living in Indonesia, and theres not a lot of young people that likes to read in Indonesia.

I am a 19 years old college student, when I was little, I saw reading as a boring activity and I didn‚Äôt want to read unless I was forced to (like studying in school).

So when I was in high school, my school forced the students to bring a book and read it for 10 minutes everyday. At that time, I think ‚Äúwell this is boring, might aswell use that time to sleep‚Äù. But someday my concious brain thought that reading a book was a good idea that day. And so I read my book, It was called The Dark Disciple, A Star Wars Story (My mom recommended it to me because I love Star Wars so much). Someway somehow I got hooked about the book and kept reading and reading it, I found the characters and the events that are happening are very interesting until I flipped the last page of the book and the book ended.

I felt so much excitement and felt a little empty after finishing that book, and wanted to read more Star Wars book. And so I searched online for a good Star Wars Book recommendation and accidently found a surprising self improvement genre. I saw a review of a book called The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck by a random user   from this subreddit. I was so interested about the content of the book and I decided to bought the book and read it. And again, I was hooked on reading it. The book taught me about life lessons,  choosing things that I have to cared into, commitment, failure and a lot of life lessons. It was a wonderful experience.

After reading that 2 books, I fell in love on reading. I find it as much as enjoyable now compared to before. And it really changed my life, because it impact me as a person that don‚Äôt have that much of an experience in life and learnt it from ideas that other people created from their experiences by living through it.

A book is like a portal to another dimension, similar to a video game, but as an added bonus, books can give you a permanent award to your life compared to not much of every video games have. It will give you a positive impact to your mind, and changing your life.",books,2280

**Origin**

Everything is dark, without any flash of light or anything that can be observed, as if it were the abyss of a starless sky. A kind of gray haze appears above the darkness dispersing in the middle of nowhere. A series of steps begin to be heard, like a kind of hollow sound that increased every second ... Something is coming.

A gray silhouette appears very slowly, whose body proceeds to sit in the middle of the void. You can see a human form covered with a gray hood, his face is wrapped in the darkness of his shadow, only the white strands of his hair can be seen. Her white arms protruded from the sleeves and leaned on her knees.

\- Hello ... - His voice was a mix of high and low. It's soft and creepy at the same time - Wondering who I am? - A smile appeared on his chin. His teeth gleamed like a glow in the dark - I'm just an entity - he analyzed - Where are we? - slowly fanned around her - in the void where only space and I exist. What do I want? - She thought - I just want to talk to entertain myself in the middle of this emptiness and explain how everything that exists works.

His position makes him uncomfortable and he changes to another position. He leans against something invisible in the dark void.

\- You know everything that exists. That's what they call it. Universe or multiverses, space or simulation. What you see, feel and hear are made by the same laws that make everything. Since it is made of dimensions, as we all know and live in the third dimension. We can see it as a sphere, but‚Ä¶ What about the other dimensions? Well ... I'll explain what they are made of. In the first place, the third dimension that identifies it as a cube, is made of layers-planes of the second dimension, which would be the planes. While the second dimension is formed by a set of lines of the first dimension, which are the group of lines of a plane - raised both arms - everything tends to infinity. We both implement the same with the fourth dimension, being a set of dimensional cubes. Which lead to form the fourth dimension. The fourth dimension is believed to be time. But even so, there are about eleven dimensions.

The entity began to smile more and continues to explain.

\- You know it from all the scientists who have studied these laws.

He stands up and walks in front of us. Imagining as if we were there.

\- I'll show you a particular dimension. This story begins in a parallel dimension, where the laws of that universe are different. Living things can control the properties of everything. Sure, some have different abilities to control them, but it depends on your training and skill. It is a world where they call it ""Pangea"". A blue planet with only one supercontinent, where everything is united.

The panorama turns dark, then shines with a very intense white light. The entity had vanished to show a planet with the ancestral continent:

""Pangea"".

This rocky body is the union of the continents that we now know today. But, in this dimension it is found in only one supercontinent.

The panorama is shown in the western part, where America should be. We approach a specific area, where mountains and plains oriented from East to West emerge, until we reach a city called: ""Chuviscar"".

It was 2000 A.D. of this world, where technology is in its development with buildings of twenty floors approximately in the center of the city. They have ten buildings on the edges of the urban development site. In the center you can see two rivers that cross adjacently, until they form one.

As that entity had mentioned. In this dimension, whose story will be told later, where its inhabitants have the ability to control some of the properties of physical, chemical and quantum laws. Since, they can control the movement of some atoms, to be able to make chemical reactions to form fire, gases, liquids (water) and some components of the earth.

There are certain very specific abilities, capable of controlling beyond atoms, such as the wave property, orbital jump, flowing electrons (electricity), subatomic particles and other laws of the standard model (quantum model more updated by current physics).

Many of its inhabitants are trained to control these properties in order to be able to work, they must also train and study them so as not to hurt anyone.

People create laws for the use of such properties. Thus, they control society and everyone's peace. Or so it seems.



                                     A NIGHT

The spring breeze abounded around her. It was a city with a semi-desert climate.
There was a particular university that, by the name of the city, is called: ""University of the Chuviscar City"".
Students take their classes and study with their teachers. Teachers in their morning time recently come to the teachers' lounge to make a cup of cappuchino coffee, and then go to teach. The secretaries converse with their co-workers in a lively and energetic way, due to the years of friendship they have at work.
Likewise, there is a group of young people sitting on the balcony of the university. Their laughter and screams could be heard all over the hall no matter what others think. A young woman with straight black hair stands out. It has some flashes of light reflection from being such a shiny hair. Clear. Her name is Elena Cortez. Her eyes are brown with long eyelashes, her full lips show a mole on the upper right.
She looked at the time and was shocked at the time it took. He was about to have his Roman Law class. He said goodbye and started running in his red heels to class. She entered the living room, looked at an empty place that is next to her best friend and went to her.
""Good morning, Yadira."" Her voice was airless. She was agitated being in such a rush for her class.
""Good morning, Elena,"" she raised her eyebrow and said some comments for being almost late.
They settled into their chairs to be more comfortable. They took out their notebooks to prepare in class, when the teacher begins to explain.
- How were you yesterday with Rub√©n? - Yadira asked when she felt that she couldn't handle her curiosity.
- You didn't convince me. It's cute, but very weird.
- And Gerardo?
- Well ... he's very handsome. But he's too ladies' man - he tightened his lips - I wouldn't want to hang out with him. I do not wanna get hurt. How about you?
His friend positions himself to the side to see Elena more comfortable.
- Yesterday I went with some friends. We drank a little - she rambled through her memories for a moment - it was fun, but no luck, friend.
The class teacher came in imposingly. He was wearing a suit and tie. He is wearing glasses of the best brand, a slicked back hairstyle, making him more impressive with his appearance. It is noted that he is around thirty-eight years old. His daily shift was to teach classes in the mornings, before entering his law office
- Good morning, young people. Let's continue with class - his speech is serious so the group will take him seriously.
With those words, he gave the class. It was long due to the teacher's requirement, to finish until noon. The stomach began to demand food from everyone and they all gathered in the university cafeteria.
The place has a restaurant style design with a metallic design. It has a part of the place, a wall full of food, where the students collect their food after ordering it at the counter.
Elena and Yadira were sitting at a table with armchairs instead of chairs, to make themselves more comfortable. They were discussing the topic of the homework the teacher had ordered and the time she had to leave her last class. They stressed out how difficult it was to go out somewhere to have coffee and go home.
To one side of them. A fat young man approaches. His hair style was long, straight and blonde that reached down to his ears. He was very curious on his lips and his eyes were smaller than normal. He sat down next to Yadira and felt suffocating.
- How are you, friends, how are you?
- Hello‚Ä¶ - Yadira said dryly. She changed her posture of denial and was walking away from him inch by inch.
- Hello ... - Elena also answered in the same way.
- What are you going to do this afternoon?
- Nothing. We're just going to our houses - Elena said with a more brusque tone.
- Come on - she came a little closer - I have plans to go with some friends to the festival and ... - Yadira interrupted her suddenly.
- No thanks. We have a lot of homework to do.
They were very uncomfortable. They could not bear the harassment of the boy and they left the place, to leave him alone.
It was the last hour of class and everyone was excited and tired. Some guys were planning to party to get drunk and invite some girls, to make it exciting. Except the two of them had other plans.
It was late and it was nearing dusk. They headed for the next college on the other side of the parking lot. It was the Faculty of Engineering and Sciences. Its two-story long buildings were adorned by the beautiful parks that surrounded each structure. Each mini-bridge that connects to the second floor classrooms was placed on horizontal cylinders to show off how fascinating calculations of statics in structures are.
The young ladies walked under those structures and marveled at the genius of the engineer who designed it and the workers who made it.
When they reached the corridors. They saw that everyone's dress was more casual, than the law students; the girls have the same style of clothing as the boys: jeans, simple T-shirts or blouses with a sweater for the cold morning, flat shoes or tennis shoes and at the end, their school backpack.
Both girls were talking to each other and wondering about their clothes. Yadira said that a friend of hers explained that they dress like this, due to acid labs. Others for the use of tools and others for field trips. Although Elena replied that she was not interested in anything more than seeing the boys from that college. They both laughed and started looking at everyone to find someone they liked.
They all stared at them as they passed the hallways of the classrooms and the park path, to head towards the administration faculty. They only gave a curve that divides the way to the passage of the laboratory and the other faculty.
Both women decided to walk more slowly to look at a man, a student who has disheveled hair, because he had put on a protective mask. He was wearing his black glasses that made him look more mysterious and manly. They captured his slim face shape and sharp chin. He has a black jacket over his blue shirt with blue jeans and brown shoes. On his shoulder hung his briefcase full of books and a computer. On top of it was his lab coat.
""Look, Yadira,"" he beckoned to the boy. I felt a pulse of nerves - What do you think?
- I like it - she looked at him without turning her head - I like her mystery.
- I will talk to him? - He felt a stroke of despair. I had a feeling that I should speak to him - I will ask him about something or I don't know.
Her friend looked at the college buildings and looked at her watch. They were about to be late.
- Maybe - she lasted a moment thinking - we can't, Elena. Hurry. Fani awaits us.
She was disappointed that she couldn't meet the boy. He wanted to talk to her, even if it was the sound of his voice. Only, to leave that lost moment that could have been a beginning.
The boy kept watching the students pass by. When the girls stopped looking at him, he could now see them without concern. He knew they were whispering about him. He found it funny that they talked about him. He tried to memorize the two girls, so that he could converse with them once. He could only see their shiny hair walking away from the gardens, until he saw a group of large, robust-looking boys stare at them. It was clear that they are the group of a soccer team or some other sport. They wore a series of sports combination, along with hats from the university team. They began to follow her very stealthily. His laughter and the way he approached them alarmed and annoyed the boy.
Now ... they followed.
The two friends had arrived at the faculty on time. They watched as another blonde girl with a slim complexion energetically approached. She was dressed in a pink shirt with blue jeans with platform heels. She extended both arms to hug them both. They decided to go to a local cafeteria in the neighborhoods of the university circuit. They walked happily and played with each other. As they crossed the streets about to be run over. One of them yelled at them and cursed them with the forbidden finger, and then continued to joke with each other.
The place was very friendly. The girls arrived at the establishment and savored the smell of food, coffee and desserts. Their stomachs were activated to be able to feel pleasure of great sweet and creamy flavors that the place offers.
It was a very pleasant conversation. The three of them laughed at every nonsense and the rumors of their school, the boys who spoke, the teachers who failed them at the cost of being at parties.
The talk had come to an end. The night abounded in their surroundings and the three women were surprised at how late it was. They exceeded the time they should be, while Fani got nervous, because her parents scolded her when she got home. Elena had her cell phone ringing at all times. It was her mother demanding that she go home as quickly as possible.
She stood up and paid the bill and then said goodbye to her friends. They both asked her if they would accompany her, however, she refused, because it was urgent and that Yadira's parents are on their way.
She said goodbye and left the place to walk home.
Elena Cortez lives a few blocks from campus. She would only have to walk down a dark and rough road.
Every time she passed down that street, when she was late in her outings with her friends or when her teacher was late in giving the last class in winter season, which always got dark at four o'clock. She never liked crossing that street. She always tried to take other routes so as not to be in the dark. But, that night, there was a blackout throughout the colony.
I had no choice.
Her heels began to hit the ground that she was so afraid of. The silence around her made her feel nervous. Each block that passed was longer than normal, her nerves began to betray them and she looked everywhere as if she were an alarmed little deer. Until a sound chilled his blood.
A series of footsteps began to be heard. A kind of murmuring with manly voices appeared along with laughter and jokes. She hastened her steps so that she could distance herself from those men and they too began to follow her step.
They were following her.
Her heels didn't help her move faster, not even being stealthy. Her breath hitched as the men approached along with a couple of embarrassing screams.
A vehicle lit up the entire street. He walked over to her to face Cortez's side, door glass down. He was a twenty-year-old boy. He was wearing a college football team jersey, though, I couldn't see his face due to the darkness.
- Do you want me to give you a ride? - He smiled in a flirtatious way - I can take you home.
- No thanks. I can walk alone. My house is a few blocks from here - her voice was a mixture of nervousness and fear. Her heart was beating too fast at the presence of the boy and the approaching men.
He kept insisting.
- Come on - her attitude was erratic. She felt a scent of alcohol on her body - I can take you home - now she smiled and her teeth lit up in the dim light - or we can take a walk, first.
- I can not. My parents would be mad at me if I'm late - he walked quickly again, the boy's insistence was obvious. I was drunk. He couldn't be with someone at this hour like this.
She quickened her pace without taking her eyes off the truck and the men following her. Until, I collide with another person in front. She was startled and looked at the large size of the boy. His posture indicated that he was expecting her.
How long had he been standing there?
- He told you to get on. Let's go!
The group of men caught up with her. They had circled her so she couldn't escape.
- I'm going to be late - one of them grabbed her arm - my parents are waiting for me. Leave me! Please - one of them took her by the arm - let me NO!
It was four men who held her. She was struggling with all her strength, but she could do nothing against the strength of those young men. They pushed her hard and struggled to get her into the black truck and get in with her.
She screamed with all her might and implored to be left alone. Only the pilot laughed at how he heard their screams, until a hand appeared in the middle of the darkness.
He held one of the boys by his shirt and threw him towards the wall until he crashed. The sound of the concrete was so loud that it alarmed everyone and they looked at someone in the dark.
- She said leave her alone. She is too tired to deal with you - her voice was short and serious. Her face could not be seen in the shadows of the night. Only, a black jacket and blue jeans were visible.
All the men reacted with a curse and got out of the truck to surround the stranger. They thought about beating him up, since they are four against one.
Elena was locked in and she just freaked out and tried to open the doors without success. Just to watch how they face off against him.
- Do not get what you do not mind! - Said one of the angry menacing and raised her arm to give a curved blow. She dodged it by moving her head back and responded with a hook to the stomach and another to the head. They all looked surprised at how their partner collapsed.
Two minus ... three left
They all rushed at him. One of them pulled out a very long knife, while another struck with his right towards his face. He reacted with a grab on his arm, positioned himself under him to throw him at another of the attackers and they collided with each other. Another of them drew his knife to stab him with a rapier. He slid to her left, held her wrist to position her arm, and slammed his forearm against her elbow, snapping it in two. Loose bones and torn tendons made him scream in agony, until he shut him up with a half-twist kick and threw him against the wall.
- You better get out and leave the lady alone, please.
They ignored it. The chauffeur approached him. He clenched his teeth for all the trouble he caused them. He readied his fists for a fight, raised them to his chin and his hands turned purple. He was using a property to harden his bones and muscles.
- You even think I'll leave without killing you, idiot. My fists will grind your stupid face - he growled loudly and his breathing was like that of a bull.
That unknown boy prepares for the impact, but is caught by another of the aggressors who were still conscious. He didn't seem to care when he looked at the driver head-on attacking him with his purple fist. He raised his arms and dropped to the ground to watch as the driver hit his friend and threw him against a tree.
He kicked him in the stomach from the ground and knocked him down with the other leg. He stood up with a spring like he was some kind of kangaroo.
- UNFORTUNATE! - He rubbed his stomach.
- Get out! - was more demanding.
The attacker lunged at him with a cry of fury. The mysterious boy began to shine his hands to generate a series of very strong shock waves and hit him in his chest. His opponent suffocated so much that he felt his ribs break and he lost his consciousness. His body was thrown so fast to the other end of the street and it fractured a wall.
He took a deep breath after finishing the fight. He looked at the parked vehicle where the girl is being held. He looked for the floor keys the driver left when he hit him seriously and walked over to her. He opened the door and saw how scared she was.
- Quiet. Everything is fine - she softened her voice and raised her hand in a cordial way and indicated - come. You are safe.
- Who you are? - she was scared after all the panic she had.
- A friend - he smiled - it seems that you saw me in my faculty.
His heart stopped. It was that boy they looked at for a long time. He thought of someone he might know from engineering or management school.
She accepted his hand and he helped her down carefully so she wouldn't hit herself. She never imagined someone like him would follow her to save her. She only wondered ‚ÄúWhy? Why did you follow me here? "" that idea chilled his blood.
- And what's your name? - The boy broke the silence.
She reacted instantly and responded nervously.
""Elena‚Ä¶ Elena Cortez"" he relaxed his voice and she wondered why he spoke delicately.
- Where do you live, Elena?
- I live ... I live a few blocks - he pointed to the front - over there.
- Let me accompany you, Elena - inclined her head a little - it is dangerous for you to walk in the dark right now. I imagine you watch the news.
- Yes - she was nervous. I did not know whether to trust her - apparently I am very ignorant of what the news and warnings say.
The boy insisted on accompanying her. She was afraid that he would follow her from college. EL was able to explain that she saw the bullies follow them from her school. He relaxed her more when he said he never took his eye off them.
Both decided to walk to leave behind the badly injured attackers.
Now the path was different. She felt safe and at the same time terrified after what happened. She looked at him and thanked him inconsolably for what happened. He just said that the kidnappers are a group from the university sports team and they were famous for leaving a big scandal in bars and suspended in various games. She was just glad to stop that kind of behavior.
The conversation reassured her and she made the minutes pass as if they were seconds until she got home. It was one story. Its material was seen to be concrete and brick. The windows are protected by bars and the gate with the same material. Only one tree covered the two of the beacon of light.
She was relieved and comfortable in being home. She only faced her in the shadow of the tree.
- Thank you very much for your help - she smiled - if it weren't for you - I only imagine the worst - I would have been kidnapped and ... and ... anything for those idiots - she was terrified of the idea as I felt they could kill her.
- Do not worry. You were in danger and needed help.
- Thank you - she thought for a few seconds. I didn't know anything about her - you haven't told me your name.
- Travis. Travis cannot
- Travis? Your name is not common in this city.
- Yes - he smiled nervously - my parents are not from here. They named me after a relative - he approached the entrance fence and his face lit up in the streetlight.
Elena could see her face. She was shocked when she saw that her eyes are different from the normal human eye. The iris was shaped like a blue rhombus and its black pupil is striped like that of a reptile or feline.
- Wow. Emmm. Your eyes are ... - He wandered to find a word and break the silence.
- Yes - her behavior changed - my eyes are different than yours. Let's say they are‚Ä¶ unique and rare - he began to feel ashamed - because they are‚Ä¶ - he interrupted.
- No. No. - Now she felt the same - I like your eyes - I didn't want to make you feel bad - I like the color of your eyes and I think the way you have them is great.
Those words made him feel better and more for not wanting to make him feel bad. She smiled and I took it as a compliment.
- Thank you - she remembered a few things and felt that Elena had to go into her house - I have to go. Tomorrow we have classes - he turned to move away a little and she opened her door little by little.
- Seem right. Have a nice night - she raised her hand - thank you.
- You're welcome, Elena - she did the same with her hand - Bye!
""Bye,"" he closed the door as Travis walked away smiling.
The night was a passing time for him. To be able to look with his own eyes, the dark truth of people.

Meanwhile, on the banks of the city. It was getting colder than normal. Since nature and water make the temperature drop.
There is a particular company called: Chemistry Corp. An industry that has its administrative department, in a fifteen-story building and next to it, there was a plant the size of two soccer fields.
The place was full of fauna and flora, in an arid and desert climate that separates them by bars and security screens.
The entrance was empty, due to two unconscious officers on the ground, cameras damaged and lights off.
An explosion occurs on the 10th floor and then another explosion on the 6th floor. Among the smoke from the fire that emitted the sixth floor, a dark silhouette appears and falls to the roof of the industry plant. He began to run to the other end and jump into the void to disappear like a ghost. Just leaving a kind of spectral dust.
A series of fire and police sirens approaches the scene. They tend to the wounded guards and the others go to put out the fire.
A speeding limousine approaches and pulls up in the corporation parking lot.
A pale man with black hair and his suit made him look like a businessman. He exits the vehicle to see the disaster and how the fire consumed that part of the structure.

"I just read war and peace and I just wanted to say a little thing: this book, although written 150 years ago, it's alive:  the characters , the ambience, the world, everything is perfectly natural, fresh and genuine, Tolstoj has an unnatural talent for writing, but for me that wasn't the main reason I greatly enjoyed this elephant of a book, simply the authenticity of everything made 1800's Russia a place where we all could be living our daily lives, with our regrets, sufferings and insecurities, but also with our hope, redemption and joy.",books,545
"Sure, some words are outdated and the language is very sophisticated. I've read my fair share of classics as a non-native speaker but this book requires you to pay full attention to every little word. The descriptions (especially of nature) are so rich and the dialogue so nuanced that I feel like even if I try my hardest I still miss out on some details. 
I think it's one of the books that feels more rewarding when you reread it.",books,433
"Hi! I've been doing so much reading this year and it's getting to the point where I feel like I need to do more with what I'm consuming than just moving onto the next read (as great as that is!).

I wanted to start looking into reviewing books--not really for profit or clicks or anything, just for my own personal shits and giggles. I started up a blog for it and though it doesn't get a lot of attention, I've found it to be kind of rewarding, and knowing that I might post about a book later has started to help me better retain the things I read.

Has anyone here found luck in this sort of avenue? Do you know any good book review sites to share? I have a Goodreads account and will read book reviews on there sometimes, but I don't like to take things so seriously, and taking things too seriously seems to be that website's sort of wheelhouse.

Thanks in advance! :)",books,873
"I‚Äôve got two.

One from Catch-22 that made me chuckle where Yossarian is describing Clevinger, ‚ÄúIn short, he was a dope. He often looked to Yossarian like one of those people hanging around modern museums with both eyes together on one side of a face. It was an illusion, of course, generated by Clevinger's predilection for staring fixedly at one side of a question and never seeing the other side at all.‚Äù

Historical fiction surrounding the most famous divorce in History (Henry VIII from Catherine of Aragon) from the prospective of Thomas Cromwell. While the main plot of this book may be a political drama (think the 2013 film ""Lincoln"") its most enduring aspect is the very human portrayal of the notorious historical figures it chronicles. Cromwell is an Iago with a heart, Anne Boleyn a ruthless social climber, and Henry VIII is a monarch riddled with insecurity.

"This title came up on another subreddit when someone asked for recommendations for reads with strong women characters who don‚Äôt have romantic relationships. I just finished reading it and am left feeling disappointed, because while it‚Äôs true that Keiko lives to the beat of her own drum and isn‚Äôt swayed‚Äîmuch‚Äîby society‚Äôs expectations of women, it‚Äôs pretty clear that she‚Äôs on the autism/Asperger‚Äôs spectrum.

While I like novels that highlight characters who are on the spectrum, and appreciate how they can reveal other ways of thinking and perceiving, I couldn‚Äôt help wondering if this story could have been told by a female character who‚Äôs not on the spectrum, and could it still have been ‚Äúabout a strong female character‚Äù that eschews romance? In other words, given the other societal norms Keiko flouts (an unmarried Japanese woman, without a career and no children in sight), does she HAVE to be on the spectrum in order to explain it all?",books,947
"Hello All,

&amp;#x200B;

I am reading this book. It's good but I have one issue that is bugging me.  The protagonist is my age. Right now 43. 35 when he wrote the book and so was I.  Yet he talks like he's 60+ Says things that I would never say. Doesn't lament missing the movies or music of today. Things that would drive me insane. But that's not a big deal. It's more the euphemisms he uses.    


I do not know any characters from the Beverly Hillbillies.   
I do not know St Saunders got his head chopped by a propeller blade (don't even know what show)  
He picks an obscure Rolling stone song to sing.  I've never said ""Gave me the willies"" in my life - or ""Little by slowly""   


It's a great book but in his afterward he said he put a ton of time into the research on this one. I'd have liked him to give the book to a couple 35-year-olds and had them update the references. We grew up in the 90s. Not the 70s.",books,920

"I am incredibly upset that Stephanie Meyer doesn't plan on continuing this series through Edward's eyes. 

The way she wrote 15 years ago, compared to this book, is so different. I remember reading through all of Bella's angst and insecurities. Edward has some insecurities too, but it also seems like Stephanie Meyer has also matured, and so has her writing.

In the last 10 years or so, it became difficult for me to re-read any of the Twilight books. But this one drew me in from start to finish, even knowing exactly how the book would end, Edward's perspective captivated me as an adult the way Bella's captivated me while I went through my own teenage angst.

"So for the past few years I have been struggling to read. I tried all type of genres,I picked up old classics, I tried out highly acclaimed fantasy series,I even tried motivational books. And nothing was sticking. I would get a third of way through the book and realize I wasn't enjoying it. For example I started The Way of Kings by Branden Sanderson. Highly acclaimed, the summary seemed right up my alley, but 1/3rd of the way through I just didn't care and put it on the shelf. I feel like I should like it but I didnt 

I was mainly attributing it to the fact that I feel I don't have a very good imagination. Im one of those people who watches the movie so that when I read the book everything is already in place, I know what everyone looks looks like ECT. Than I connected it to my lack of understanding, so I started to take notes. Write down a summary of each chapter as I read them. This led to it taking a long time for me to read a single chapter though.

Well last week I discovered Marvel Unlimited. Basically you pay 10 bucks a month and you get access to an insane amount of marvel comics. Now I love the X-Men, I was reading through the original comics a while back. So I did the free trial and I gathered up the old X-Men comics, the newest ones, and a random series I found called Black Bolt. 

I'll tell you I haven't read this much in years. I was excited to read again! Every free moment I had I was reading instead of flipping through Facebook or reddit. Everytime I opened up Facebook my brain said 'dude you could be reading right now, get on it!' it just felt so good to be back to the way I used to be, devouring books daily. It was like a breath of fresh air and I feel great about myself",books,1717
"Now, I have normally talked about books I enjoyed, but this novel is a huge pile of sh*t that I just had to vent about. I could go into detail about how inept the novel is on just the writing level (it's just so boring) but I'm not going to and you should thank me. I do want to focus on the characters, or what the novel attempts to have. Because, there are no characters, just meat husks for the readers to hate that have the depth of a flat piece of paper. They are also so unlikable that I was rooting for the guy that killed a character in the novel because he was the only person to show a hint of sympathy. The main protagonist is ironically the worst person in the novel as she is so willfully ignorant that I want to slap her across the face and tell her to wake up. I am not a hundred percent sure if we are supposed to like the protagonist or not, but if I have to ask that question than the novel has failed spectacularly.",books,934

"I‚Äôve always loved Greek and Roman mythology. I remember learning about it school and getting totally absorbed. Despite being an adult when they came out I lived the Percy Jackson books, and the connected series.

"Has anyone read anything from [Becky Chambers ](https://www.otherscribbles.com/) ?

The first of the Wayfarers series blew my mind.
It is a scifi,  which honestly isn't my favorite genre, but couldn't put it down.

Her writing style is unique, while the world building is fascinating. 

I also love how the characters have their own back stories and therefore their personalities.

Coming from a family of scientists,  she managed to create a believable future, where technology allows species to travel from galaxy to galaxy.

I love the first book, a little disappointed as the second goes in a different direction,  but still very much enjoyable.

"I have just finished reading this book and although I admit it is slow in some places , it has been years since I have felt so in awe after reading a book. The slow build up may make it hard to read at points but it makes the book so intimate and the characters so real that when events occur to them you can truly feel either happy or sad.
The book also gives a very real account of the nature of war and how there is a lot of sitting around doing nothing in war and then the few events that might take place are never really as glorious as other novels portray them but rather sad and necessary affairs that take a toll on both sides. 
This book does a great job of really humanising soldiers in war and showing how to kill another man is not like taking out mindless characters in a video game but comes with a really big emotional toll for most people.
In short this book is a masterful description of the human mind and the effect of war on people.",books,953
"A little bit about me first because im quite picky, but youll see why
Books ive read:
Harry potter series
Power of 5 series
Alex rider series
The fellowship of the ring
The eye of the world (wheel of time)
The last wish (the witcher)
Game of thrones

I read physical books as a kid but havent been able to since i got older, cant seem to focus anymore...ill read half a page and have to read it again coz i wasnt paying attention...so i turned to audiobooks for the last 3 books on that list.
The reason why ive only read/listened to 1 book out of a series from the bottom half of that list is because it was either too dense to read or too much of a focus on romance/incest 
I love the concept of the witcher, but i feel it focuses on the wrong things when reading so im happy to just play the games.
Game of thrones is just straight up, not my thing
Wheel of time was spoiled by a friend and, again its abit too much for me to chew. (Plus i lost my place about halfway through book 2 and cba starting again)
The lord of the rings i appreciate as the ""father"" of fantasy but the books are not enjoyable (spending 2 pages to read about a wonderfully described rock just doesnt do it for me) loved the films and concept though!
Not interested in the concept of narnia or the discworld series so i understand im limiting myself here. 

Im looking for something slightly along these lines though.. just easier to digest and no main focus on romance and sex... literally cringe so heavily reading or listening to it.. no matter how talented the writer is. 
Im open to dark themes, big entities, gods etc 
Id like plenty of action and exploring.. im always keen on the idea of ""the underdog teenage farmhand that gets to explore the world on a quest"" like the hobbit or wheel of time. 
Id like to keep it within traditional/generic fantasy.. so nothing like the edge chronicles which have steampunk vibes. 
I understand im picky and i apologise for that, but i dont want to invest in a series of books unless im truly excited for it. 
Ive had a look at the emaneska series which have intrigued me but i dont know what its written like and if its too ""adult"" or intricate as hell. 
If theres anyone out there in this community that can point me in the right direction i would greatly appreciate it.. 
Id also prefer audiobooks to physical copies as stated before.
Im open to discussion 
Thanks in advance",books,2398

Lately i have been trying to cultivate my listening abilities, to truly listen to others without shifting the conversation or trying to control the narrative.

As with many ambitions i try to realize them through informing myself through a couple of good books.

A brief stop at the small local bookstore led me to a book titled You‚Äòre not listening by Kate Murphy, has anyone read this before? Any thoughts on it?

"I just started reading ""The Last Wish"" by Andrzej  Sapkowski, and I intend to continue with the series. In the book, a lot of characters and locations are being referred to in an off-handed way. I do not want to lose track of the things being mentioned. It would also be of great help if I could refer to maps for the geographical locations of the places being mentioned. Someone, please suggest me a solution.

I know that one can look these up in wikis, but I am hesitant as they often include spoilers in character descriptions. As you can tell, I want to avoid them at all costs.

The appendices and maps included in each book in A Song of Ice and Fire were a great help to me in this regard. Besides including detailed maps for the locations, they also included character descriptions and character relations without revealing any spoilers present in that particular book. Something similar to that would be really helpful.

That being said, if any pre-made maps/character wikis for the (preferably for individual) books are not present, I am willing to put in the work and create them as I proceed with the series and create one for myself. In that case, please suggest any tools or methods that you know of to help me with this.",books,1235

"I would walk over broken glass barefoot to get to the kind of good book that ""The Devil All the Time"" was for me. I've yet to find its equal in the current gothic literature. Please provide recommendations if you have any. 

After retiring from his manual labor job at the Chillicothe paper mill and losing his wife to cancer, first time novelist Donald Ray Pollock pulled off with violent grace the kind of narrative intricacy and stylistic command we associate with Steinbeck and Faulkner. I stayed up into the dawn to finish that book, and when I did... Damn. I needed a cigarette.

The movie is coming out on Netflix soon. I'm sure it will be pretty good, the source material is solid. They've got some rock star talent attached. It could be a masterpiece, for anyone's guess, and I hope it is. I've been let down plenty enough before.

The book IS a masterpiece, though. That's why I think anybody who ends up liking the movie and enjoys a grisly dark crime novel too should pick this one up before the film's version is cemented in their mind. I hate when I see a good flick only to find out there was a great book I missed reading before seeing its adaptation. 

Pollock's follow up ""The Heavenly Table"" was worth every penny too.",books,1237

"I'm not sure how to word this, tried to make a search but didn't find anything. Is there a site or database that has lists of possible actors for the main characters in a book? A casting list so to speak, maybe some suggestion of different actors and a vote system for the most popular one for the role?

When I read a book I try to visualize the main characters by associating a real actor/actress and finding such lists in one place would be really handy. For example I'm currently reading a book from the Amelia Peabody series and for the two main characters I picture Rachel Weisz and Gerard Butler as Peabody/Emerson.

"It was incredible. Every character was strikingly real, existing within you before you‚Äôre even aware of it for you to then marvel at the now conscious thought of them. It was deeply horrifying but in a really fun way, creating novel ways to toy with the fragility of your mind and the minds of the characters with the legendary villainy of Pennywise. Even when exploring the fun and goofy experiences of the characters there was an existential dread ever present, becoming as horrifying as it was exciting. The winding path of all the characters was rough, and you could really feel the torture they went through in their struggle not only with pennywise but their search for happiness in such a tragic town as Derry. Yet their seemingly endless struggle only brings a sense of triumph, relief, and freedom once they‚Äôve finally freed themselves of the weight It had nearly crushed them with. All of the helplessness of Derry and the hopelessness of its future becomes reversed and bundled up into a single, enormous, sigh of freedom as Bill rides off through Derry on Silver, finally free of the shackles that were the deepest darkest parts of himself. Even through unimaginable horror he found himself laughing with Audra on Silver, finding endless joy in the spark of light shining amongst the endless void.",books,1309
"I just finished the *Divine Series* by Robert Jackson Bennett.

It was probably the best trilogy I‚Äôve read in a while. I haven‚Äôt ever written a real book review, and I honestly wish I could do that for these books to do them justice. What I would like to talk about briefly is what I loved about each book.

Book 1: [City of Stairs](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20174424-city-of-stairs)

I loved the character building and the fantasy aspect. The thing that hooked me though was the mystery aspect. Fantasy plus mystery combines my two favorite genres, and I found I couldn‚Äôt put this book down. The world building was also really great, and I think some of the philosophy was brilliantly done as well. 5/5 stars

Book 2: [City of Blades](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23909755-city-of-blades)

I felt like this was like *The Empire Strikes Back* or *The Two Towers*. It was a decent book but felt lacking in the same depth as the first book. This book follows General Turyin Mulaghesh, and her character is my second favorite after Sigrud. I enjoyed learning more of her back story and seeing how she deals with the guilt of her past. The mystery element isn‚Äôt as strong as *City of Stairs*, but I think the character building was much stronger as this novel mainly focuses on one character‚Äôs story. Once again, the fantasy element was really unique, and I enjoyed learning more about the world and how the divine interact. 4/5 stars.

Book 3: [City of Miracles](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31522139-city-of-miracles)

This was perhaps my favorite of the series. I wonder if the author felt he had to pull out a *Return of the Jedi* or *Return of the King*, but it certainly did not disappoint. This novel focuses on Sigrud je Harkvaldsson, who we have seen in all three novels, but this one really centers on him. Unlike *City of Blades*, this book does introduce more secondary characters and feels us insights into them, however, the main focus is on Sigrud. The mystery within this book was so solid, I had to read the book in one go. I spent my entire Sunday reading it and couldn‚Äôt stop.

I don‚Äôt want to give spoilers, but the way the author ended this book still has me conflicted and I have done nothing but think about it since I finished the novel. I think the mark of a great novel is one that makes you think and reflect, and this novel certainly did. 5/5 stars.

This series throws a lot of philosophy at the reader and really makes you think about society, history and our role in it. I love a novel that makes me think beyond the surface level, but when I see my two favorite genres combined to make this happen, and it is done well, it is just absolutely brilliant.

I hope others loved this series as much as I did!",books,2755
"I‚Äôm reading Russian Literature and just finished Eugene Onegin by Pushkin. As a non-Russian speaker I, of course, read the translation. The verses seemed average at best, the rhyme scheme forced. However, Pushkin is considered the father of Russian literature and a literary mastermind. Before this, I tried reading Flaubert and couldn‚Äôt get entirely into it. My question is how does one appreciate the nuances of literature and poetic devices in the translated version of a book? Is it just about finding the best translations?

* How does Melvin Royal/Absalom constantly get a hold of Gwen Proctor's and Sam Cade's phone numbers?
* After they escape the cabin in Georgia that blows up, Gwen and Sam theorize that someone must have been watching their every move and triggered the explosion. Are we supposed to believe that it was Rivard or his men who did that? Kind of unbelievable because they only get the video that leads them to Rivard *after* visiting the cabin.
* Are we supposed to understand that Ballantine Rivard planted fake evidence and drove his own son to suicide?

"Now I'm not here trying to be a book snob. But during this quarantine I've been spending a lot of time on Youtube wasting time and something I've noticed a lot of is ""Now we know the whole story"" after a movie or a second installment comes out and more details are revealed. They make it seem as if this is some great mystery that they discovered after analyzing said moves. IT by Stephen King is a great example of this. Now that the second part came out and they show a few pictures of Penny wise and gave more backstory they are acting like we got some information that hasn't been out since the 80's.

"I started reading seriously last August and I've read really good horror, sci-fi and fantasy books. I have hundreds more in my to-read list, but I decided to ask you about your 2 favorite book series and 2 standalone books from each genre. Please suggest at least 1 novel out of the 2 standalones (the one could be a collection of short stories). Please if you suggest a sub-series of a larger series/world/universe note the world that belongs to (of course by world I don't mean some less connected world like Stephen King's, but more like Cosmere). You can suggest the 2-2s for any genre you want. I read mostly Fantasy and Horror, but there are amazing Sci-fi or Thriller/Mystery books I've read in the past, so it'll be really interesting to find something new. There are amazing books in every genre. You can split the main 5-6 genres to subgenres, let's say Post-apocalyptic or Dystopia instead of Sci-fi. Also you can give more than 2 favorite books/series if you want to, so don't feel limited to only 2. And last but not least you could share with us which genre is your favorite, why do you like it, why do you choose this series, what did you like in this book, etc. The last would open more discussions in the comments, which would be awesome. Use spoiler tags when needed.


My picks (really hard to choose):

Fantasy standalone books: I can't think of any right now.

Fantasy series: Cosmere, Temerant (Kingkiller Chronicle). Honorable mentions: ASOIAF, The Dark Tower.

Sci-fi standalones: The Stand

Sci-fi series: Children of Time (haven't read the second one though)

Horror standalones: The Long Walk, The Green Mile

Horror series: never heard of one longer than 2 books

Mystery: Bird Box (not a standalone anymore?)

Magical realism: Boy's Life, The Ocean at the end of the Lane

Classic: The Old Man and the Sea, The Collector 


Favorite genre: fantasy.

I prefer to read series, but it's really refreshing to read a standalone book after a longer series, so it'll be awesome to try your favorite standalones (especially when I haven't read anything outside Cosmere for 8-9 months).


Outro off-topic:

I struggle to find good Sci-fi series with good writing, complex characters, interesting story and adult themes/topics, but to be rather approachable. Most of the good Sci-fi's are too slow or hardcore for not experienced Sci-fi readers. I also struggle to find a good horror book or series that has an actual plot (like It, The Stand) rather than just disgusting descriptions and spooky monsters killing the main characters. Another rare category for me is realistic adult fantasy like ASOIAF. I'm not the biggest fan of ASOIAF, but the adult topics and realistic characters are something else, on another level of perfection. Most of the fantasy books don't even mention sex or how a good character is killed, or when the good character kills a child the author just skip to 2 hours later. Most of the fantasy characters are either pure evil or good and almost perfect. My next stop in fantasy will be The Last Law for sure as I've heard that the protagonists are not really kind, noble and perfect. So it'll be amazing to look at your favorites and read them. I can't wait to see your picks and add them to my list.",books,3245
"Hello! I (a female) have been noticing a lot of discussion about what it means to be a woman and what differentiates a good female character and role model from a bad one. However, I don't really see a lot of discussion about what a good male character is or what male identity is.

To male readers, what characters do you think are good representations of what it means to be a man? What do you think are good male characters, and good role models for young boys to look up to? What would you say you looked up to at different stages in your life? What would you say are accurate depictions of men (kids, teens, adults) and their understanding of their own male identities? Are there any characters/moments/decisions/arcs/etc that you think depict what true masculinity is really about?

Like a kid with a new bicycle I can't get off the damn thing, I started Post Office last night and I'm already one third of the way through and I'm enjoying these books like I've never enjoyed a book before. I just wanted to share a small passage from the book that really got me and wanted to suggest the Chinaski series to anyone who hasn't given them a read. 
.
""I climbed the stairway (there was no elevator)
and put the key in. The door swung open. Somebody had changed
all the furniture around, put in a new rug. No, the furniture
was new too.
There was a woman on the couch. She looked all right. Young.
Good legs. A blonde.
""Hello,"" I said, ""care for a beer?""
""Hi!"" she said. ""All right, I'll have one.""
""I like the way this place is fixed up,"" I told her.
""I did it myself.""
""But why?""
""I just felt like it,"" she said.
We each drank at the beer.
""You're all right,"" I said. I put my beercan down and gave
her a kiss. I put my hand on one of her knees. It was a nice knee.
Then I had another swallow of beer.
""Yes,"" I said, ""I really like the way this place looks. It's really
going to lift my spirits.""
""That's nice. My husband likes it too.""
""Now why would your husband ... What ? Your husband ?
Look, what's this apartment number?""
""309.""
""309? Great Christ! I'm on the wrong floor! I live in 409. My
key opened your door.""
""Sit down, sweety,"" she said.
""No, no...""
I picked up the 4 remaining beers.
""Why rush right off?"" she asked.
""Some men are crazy,"" I said, moving toward the door.
""What do wou mean?""
""I mean, some men are in love with their wives.""
She laughed. ""Don't forget where I'm at.""
I closed the door and walked up one more flight. Then I opened
my door. There was nobody in there. The furniture was old and
ripped, the rug almost colorless. Empty beercans on the floor. I
was in the right place.
I took off my clothes, climbed into bed alone and cracked
another beer.""",books,1993
"So I just finished the audiobook of Circe after seeing the hypetrain. And it was alright like a 6 out of ten there was nothing wrong with it but nothing wonderful and great. I mean it the opening bits where great the parts with Prometheus and the being at her father's hall interesting. But a soon as she hit that island boy did this book decide to just go cliff diving. 

And her is my issues Circe is not a good female lead or a feminine icon as I have seen in some reviews(clearly this is my opinion all this is my opinion). So Circe gets her empower on the island great she gets in an friends with benefits relationship with Hermas great. 

Her sister is like hey come her I need your help giving birth to my bull headed son( ha puns) so goes. Cool we learn that her sister banged a bull because she had to stay relevant in this world of gods that she has had to survive and degrade herself in order to maintain her status and have protection from other gods. Wow what a shift this is going to have on Circe to see her sister in this new light as they both have suffered. Nope her sister was mean and while maybe they could have been friends or grown close Circe hates 90% of the female population (I'll get there) so she  rejects her sister and goes home. 

She is back and a minor goddess has shown up at her place like hey my dad sent me here for a bit as punishment for giving my virginity to a moral. How does Circe respond to this seeing another being punish for using her body as she wishes? Does she try and talk to her? Does she feel sympathy for her? Nope this is a bother to her how dare people use Circe as a punishment screw this nobody who was punished what about Circe. Also just kinda doesn't realize how privilege she is being used as a punishment for being to serve her is because she is still seen as a being of importance. Even though she is like woe is me if she wasn't the daughter of one of the most powerful gods she be dead. 

Her niece shows up one day with Jason is like hey forgive us for our sins she does, they talk about how Jason is gonna Jason. And her niece leaves. Then she is reunioned with the brother she helped raised and who  loved her. Now is the same as the myth and is a creepy evil person. Why is he like this idk myths say he is so instead of the book showing how the system can corrupt men slowly over time, having him have more than 2 dimensions, or doing the same thing with  Prometheus where he say what he would be and thus had no choice but to be that thing and in a way is just a slave to another system same as her. Nope he is mean because most gods are mean. 

Now the worse part of the book for me the rape and pig parts. Okay I think I understand what she were trying to go for that no matter who you are no matter how much you prepare and plan the worse thing in the world can happen to you. It's a powerful message that talks about the worse thing in this world. I just don't think it was handle well having it be by a random human was flawed to me because it removes the strength of Circe in an early part of the book Circe has some supernatural powers in terms of physical ability she can walk like a God which is implied to be superfast. But the bigger issue is having it be this random no name person she immediately punishes takes away from the trauma because the sad fact is most women are never able to get that vengeance. I think it needed to be a god I was thinking Hermas because he has made it clear how little the idea bothers him and he was told no, but i think it would make his later actions be more evil and just cruel so I think any random god would do. Now for the pig thing it makes the rape scene feel like it was only there for character development as it is what makes her the witch who turns men into pigs. It doesn't effect her future relationship or sexual encounters. While important as it is if you look at it through a book writing  prospective it was needed to get her to that place to be that person but keep her sympathic. Also while th book I think should have made the connections about how she is now acting more like her sister to show how having that happen to both of them has had such an affect that it would make her sister more sympathic it doesn't make tha connection and I think that is a shame. 

Okay Odysseus is perfect love how they did his ptsd and handle him. Not a fan of the whole i am get pregnant on purpose without telling him that was really crappy and might have had an impact on the story. But it happened we have to have the myths happen the way they normally do. 

Athena got done dirty just seeming 2 dimensional with save Odysseus and no other traits but whatever. 

Her raising her son was fine it was standard though both the birthing scene were well done. 

Trigon bit was great really interesting character. Circe was great there

Her leaving the island and becoming mortal for a man was bad her basically going daddy your wrong and I am leaving the corrput system was okay i guess. Her choicing to become mortal instead of making him a god is dumb but it feels kinda like the titanic door thing were its not the point. 


Last little rant: I don't see how Circe is empowering because its basically I am not like other girls. Nearly every other women in this book is view as bad from her sister to the nymphs, to Athena. Circe doesn't try to befriend any of them even her sister she is like no we can be alike even though we both had to survive a place that views us a objects, and we later become really similar. Yes Ik it say Circe only piged  those who had a look in their eyes as if they were looking for the man of the house, but i would like to point out that she doesn't know for sure and has no way of confirming and is just going on a perceived idea that they would do something. And I get it but the fact stands. I understand feminism is about owning ones sexuaility but other lart is empowering and unity women which this doesn't do.

"I recently finished the novel and largely enjoyed it. Devils/tricksters gleefully messing with an unprepared populous is always fun. And seeing this snapshot of urban USSR culture through a lens of someone living in it was fascinating.

Where I feel a little lost though is how the story of Pontius Pilate fits into the narrative. Is there any significance to him besides his pride having him deny Jesus being parallel to the prideful way characters like the poet declare their atheism? Pontius is not the only person in the bible to not follow god so I wonder if there is any significance to choosing him. What exactly about Pontius' story would have made the Master's book so controversial? How does the story differ from the bible?",books,734

"I picked up the book after a lot of my fellow readers suggested it. But in most of their recommendations, one thing rose up as common, and that was that the book is an emotional ride. After reading it myself, I'm inclined to agree. But prior to reading it, and even my among my other friends who are wary of picking it up, the common perception of the book doesn't seem to be ""an emotional ride"". Rather it's more along the lines that the book may be overly emotional, ""a tearjerker"". But here, I disagree. I do not think that the book was written with the objective of evoking empathetic tears. Rather, it related events, from an almost neutral standpoint. Almost. But that is besides the point. I have read books that have left me feeling genuinely sad, or disturbed, or full of tears and emotions. I do tend to avoid picking up such books during busy periods of my life. Hence the initial apprehension towards The Book Thief. But after reading it, I found it to be nothing of the sort. I kept waiting and waiting for that immense jerk that would send tears streaming down my face. It never came. Instead, I went through a gentle and beautiful ride of emotions. It was glorious. And at the end it was soft and warm. I loved the book. And every minute I spent reading it was worth it, tears or not. So then, why has the perception of the book become that of a tearjerker? And why does that perception keep certain readers away? 

If nothing else, the book is extremely thought provoking. Especially in this pandemic. Who would be the ones worst affected? The politics in the book is not to be belittled either. It truly describes how ""Heils"" aren't born overnight. 

But more than anything, it describes the beauty, power and meaning of words. Even a self written story of an unknown book thief, a story that met an untimely demise at the hands of death, on top of a garbage pile, even those dead words, had power. And purpose. And meaning. And an afterlife. And that they comforted, if no one else, then death itself. And eventually, their own writer. Although I must say, it left me curious. About the rest of the book thief's life. How did she end up in Sydney? And who did she marry? Well, while I'm curious, I'm also satisfied. Those maybe stories for another day. They weren't part of Himmel Street or of the Book Thief. 

I apologise if the post is too long, I have been a lurker here for quite sometime and this is my first post on the sub.

"Before I get into the reasons, I just need to say DO NOT BE PUT OFF BY THE COVER. I bought it after reading a review and I don't think I would've picked it up in any normal circumstance because the cover just does not do it justice.

If you liked Six of Crows or any book that involves groups of delinquents attempting to overthrow a hierarchy in a world with magic and blood bonding then this is a book for you. Lets get into the reasons.  


1. **Character development**. The book is written from alternating views between the 5 main characters. Since the very beginning of the book, the author creates very distinctive and lovable characters (even if some are morally grey). They really came to life in my imagination and isn't character development the main aspect anyone wants from a story?
2. **Diversity.** There are 3 POC main characters. There is great bisexual, asexual and gay representation and also a plus size character. The book also portrays anxiety in a very realistic way. (The character who has anxiety was actually the bravest character in my opinion).
3. **Magic.** Some people have abilities to see prophecies, read fortunes and see in to the very near future, remove or give back people's memories. Others can read thoughts and see people's past. There is also blood bonding which allows a person to control a particular element like silver/gold.
4. **Exciting plot.** Even though I did see the plot twist coming, I still found the book thoroughly exciting . The main characters are sentenced to death in the first few pages so the action is present right from the get-go! 
5. **Slow-building romance.** I don't want to spoil anything so I won't go into detail but hell is it super cute!!

"I am just about finished with the first book in the trilogy (*The Blade Itself*). This is my first time reading any of Abercrombie's work and so far I really like it. The writing style is interesting, especially the battle scenes, and the characters are compelling. However, I can't get it out of my head that the overarching story (so far at least) is identical to *A Song of Ice and Fire*. 

There is a group called the Shanka, a non-human species that attacks and kills any people they come in contact with. They live in the far north and people in the South don't even believe they exist. Their numbers have been growing in recent years. Simultaneously, in the North, the various warring tribes and factions have for the first time been united under one king. This northern king plans on attacking the Union (which is in the South). The Union meanwhile is corrupt and full of scheming lords and can't seem to agree on anything or get anything done. They aren't taking the threat to the North seriously and are instead busy with internal squabbles.

Is this not virtually identical to the Whitewalkers, Wildlings and Mance Raider, 7 Kingdoms, and all that. I know that all authors borrow from others to some degree but this strikes me as a bit too on the nose, especially considering that *The Blade Itself* was published in 2006 (1 year after *A Feast for Crows*).

"I did not expect to connect with the book as well as I did. It resonated with me as a woman, as a wife, and though I do not have children yet, it still resonated with me as a (future) mother. 

I started it a few months ago at the beginning of quarantine in my renewed quest to begin reading again. I left it alone in favor of finding other books to read, depending on my mood. Yesterday my husband and I made a quick day trip to Grand Isle. Being from that area of Louisiana, I‚Äôve grown up going to the island every summer, and it felt right to pick the book up again while there. I finally finished it this morning and am left with a sense of both freedom and weight.

It‚Äôs the eternal choice between what is wanted and what is expected. The right choice. The easy choice. The hard, but worth it choice. What will they say? How will I cope? Am I enough? We never know the outcomes until after the decision is made. Edna chose neither, instead ending it on her own terms. But does that make her selfish or selfless? Or was the pain too much to bear that it didn‚Äôt matter? 

It‚Äôs been awhile since a book has had such an impact on me, and it threw me quite off guard this morning with such a slow, but quick build of emotion to the end, which shook me to the core due to the overwhelming sense familiarity I fee with Edna and the novel as a whole. 

The one thing that irks me however is the silly e-reader version I purchased goes straight into her short stories right after the end of the novel. I read an entire short story thinking it was a continuation of the novel before I realized it wasn‚Äôt. It really added to the emotional jumble, and what otherwise would have been a wonderful ending for a moment of reflection.

"So I get Lolita was about Humbert disguising his predatory pedophilia as a grand romantic outing using flowery language, but then in the second half another pedophile, Quilty, becomes a prominent character, and the story shifts gears slightly to a cat and mouse chase between Humbert and Quilty. What I don't understand is what Quilty added to the story of Lolita. In many ways, Humbert and Quilty are similar characters, both are articulate pedophiles from Europe, but Quilty seems like an even darker version of Humbert. Humbert tries to portray his relationship with Dolores as romantic where as Quilty just seems like a child pornographer who uses and discards Dolores. I was wondering if this is part of the unreliable narrator aspect. Humbert sees himself as a romantic, but he's far closer to Quilty than he's willing to admit? That's the best interpretation between the interplay of Humbert and Quilty I could come up with, but I feel like I'm missing some nuance here.",books,977
"A year ago I read The Gunslinger at the behest (more like at gunpoint) of my brother. I hadn't read a fiction novel in some 15 or 20 years, and I didn't know how to start. He gave me the book, told me it was his favorite series, and made me read it while we were on our weeklong vacation (what even is that anymore?). I finished it on the last day of our trip and subsequently ordered the next two books (The Drawing of the Three and The Waste Lands). I continued reading through the series, only finding a lull in the middle of book 3, but steady on as they say. Last night I finished The Wolves of the Calla and I simply can't describe how great it feels to get through these. The story is so dense and rich and interconnected that I find myself staying up late at times just to turn one more page. I skipped Wind Through the Keyhole at the recommendation of my brother, who said it was better to read it after the final book (it was written after the final book as a sort of book 4.5 entry). I'm already 30+ pages into Song of Susannah and I don't want this series to end.

I know this has mostly been me unraveling my own path to the damned Tower, but at the end of it I'm hoping to have another, equally compelling, series to go to. That's where the fine people of Reddit come in! Please share your favorite series with me! I'm looking for books to buy!

"I'm a big fan of long, complex novels (Infinite Jest, Gravity's Rainbow) and used quarantine to read a few on my to-read list (Delillo's Underworld, which I loved, and Gaddis' The Recognitions, which I didn't like nearly as much).

Something I've been thinking a lot about lately is the state of novels like these in today's literary and social landscape. Put more simply: Can sprawling, complex novels be published today? In our era of clickbait news headlines, TikTok, social media, etc. - is there even an appetite for dense, immersive literature? Works like IJ and GR and Underworld sought to comment on a specific point (or points) in our history. Is there even a need for this anymore when you can follow the culture minute-by-minute on Twitter?",books,751

\*Forgive me if this is a bit lengthy, I don't usually do reviews unless I really like the read\*

A couple days now since I finished listening to the book and forgotten what I wanted to say how I felt about it, so here's my attempt to share my thoughts.

This is my first in many respects. My first book by Megan Whalen Turner. My first in the Queen's Thief series, and the first audiobook I've listened from start to finish. I enjoyed this and took any opportunity I had to give it a listen. (At work on lunch breaks, doing some shopping, cycling around my local area, laying in bed before going to sleep).

How did I feel about the book?

Personally, I felt the book played out more like a game of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, ""Here's your quest, find this item and bring it back to me for your reward"" etc. Large parts of the book were spent with the group of characters travelling to their destination while along the way establishing the worlds history, society, geography, the characters own backgrounds, and reason for being there all through stories of their own.

The author did a good job at building a vast open world with multiple countries and to whom they share their borders including the state of affairs between them.

For the audiobook edition I thought that the narrator really brought the story to life. Steve West gave the book that more of an appeal with his voice by adding emotion and intensity to character exchanges, when describing the scenes that lay before the characters very eyes helped with world building and immersion, giving each character a voice of their own instead of reusing the same tone over and over again for every person that was introduced along the way.

I got lost at times needing to go back and listen again to what had been said but thats just me as I'd be doing something else at the same time meaning my attention would shift slightly.

Overall I thought The Thief was an enjoyable read and had me pondering what was going to happen next when I had to stop listening.",books,2019

"Was reading through The Bands of Mourning and got to the part where MeLaan and Wayne were having a snog. It mentions that his shirt was unbuttoned and hers was completely off.

"I was talking with a friend of mine recently and she pointed out to me that she had to read ""The Waste Land"" by TS Eliot and now her life will never be the same which made me ponder on my own reading experience to see if there was a book like that for me. After some reflection I realized that I've never really had a book take my breath away in a life changing manner which is a little disappointing but im sure it will happen in the future. 

With that being said I thought I'd ask this subreddit about the books you have read and see what you all have to say because I'm interested to see what the responses are.

"I am not a very avid reader but made a goal to read more books this year than the previous one (and with the previous years total being 0, it has not be that hard of a feat). Anyways, my power went out the other day for a few hours so I decided to pick up that book that‚Äôs been sitting on my nightstand collecting dust for the past 5 years. NYPD RED, a James Patterson book. Being a thriller with most chapters being 1-4 pages long every time I completed a chapter I had this instant urge to continue further and further into the book. Needless to say it only took me around 2 days to read which is really fast under my standards.

With the last 3 books I read being the lord of the rings trilogy, the fast pace of this book felt so refreshing. Not to undermine LOTR in any way as those books are amazing and will always be some of my all time favorites, the more complex dialect and the sophistication of middle earth made it so that each book to me around a month to fully complete. 

I guess my point is that books with small chapters but lots of chapters have reignited my thirst to read within the past week, when I had Previously started but got no where with 3 or 4 different books within the past month. 

Also, I recognize a lot of books are structured this way, such as Moby Dick (on my reading list) but NYPD RED was the first that really stood out to me. Not to mention that the structuring if the chapters really added to the overall storyline of the book. Just picked up NYPD RED 2 this morning and am really looking forward to exploring the rest of the series.

I've never had dyslexia or any learning disorders identified, I just struggle with concentration it seems. So here are my questions;

"I'm thinking of reading The Little Friend but it seems like that's the most disliked book of Tartt's that she's written. Is it worth reading or should I skip it all together?

"I lost my dad three months ago. He battled an illness for two months and I was at the hospital taking care of him. It was a traumatic experience for everyone in the family because Covid-19 made the hospital short-staffed and the treatment he received was far from ideal. The pain of seeing him pass away in agony is something that haunts me every day. After everything was over, I turned to books and media. I thought, well, last year I was too busy to read books, so I might as well use the free time to catch up with reading. 

A long introduction, I know. 

I've never believed that reading itself is comforting; for me it is the book that does the trick. Reading depressing books only made me feel worse and left me exhausted. Then, I found All Systems Red (Murderbot Book 1) on discount. I read it and absolutely loved it. I wanted to read the rest but I hesitated because of the somewhat expensive price (and I'm talking about e-books). In the end, I began to feel I was going to be a bit overwhelmed by my angst, so I just bought all the four remaining books and read them back to back over a period of two days. It was the best decision I'd made in a long time.

What do I love about the Murderbot Diaries? They're funny--Murderbot is funny. The future it is located in isn't ideal, but at least people can marry whoever they want regardless of gender and identify as non-binary with no one complaining. It does help that the stories are narrated from the point of view of an intelligent construct that doesn't give a crap about human relationships or sexuality. I enjoy his adventures. The villains aren't memorable (perhaps, they aren't meant to be); it doesn't matter because the books have the right amount of action and suspense and camaraderie. Reading them is a stress-free experience that brought me out of a funk and got me reading more and feeling lighter than I have in ages. 

The book has been discussed and referenced here before. I'm fairly new to Reddit and this community, but I noticed it being mentioned in some threads. At the risk of sounding redundant, I wanted to know if anyone felt happy after reading these books. Has any other book made you feel this way and saved you from emotional pain?",books,2224

" Hello! I‚Äôve lurked around this sub long enough and finally have something of note to post. 

A few months ago while lurking on this sub I came across a post where various science fiction books were recommended, chief among them were the Old Man‚Äôs War series, Peter Hamilton‚Äôs Judas Unchained, Dune, and Ian M Banks culture series. Needless to say being a massive fan of sci fi I bought all of them. I‚Äôve been on the fence on buying them for a while but reading your descriptions and explanations for the books really made the decision for me. 

So a little background (you can skip this as its not in context of the book but more of who I am):

I am from Malaysia a country which unfortunately doesn‚Äôt really have that much of a science fiction community or circle for me to share my thoughts and have discussions with. In fact unfortunately among my closest friends only I read books and if any of the others do their area of interest is definitely not sci fi. As some of you may know, that makes the mind a little lonely because sometimes all you want to do is discuss the various ways humanity can move along the Kardashev scale. Anyway moving on, I‚Äôm a child of the sci fi era, grew up watching Star Trek (TNG), Stargate, and Star Wars, not to mention all the other amazing shows such as Battlestar Galactica and etc. More than anything since I was a kid I wanted to be in a starship, I wanted to be a part of a generation that took mankind to the stars. These books recommendations from these sub has been perfect to fill the void left by not having any decent sci fi series on TV/streaming.

Now, onward with the series: Old Man‚Äôs War:

Omg this book series is amazing. I am close to finishing the 3rd book in the series ‚ÄúThe Last Colony‚Äù and I have got so much to talk about that I couldn‚Äôt wait till it was done to post this. 

Scalzi is an amazing author. Prior to this series I finished the Last Emperox series to familiarize myself with his writing and am thankful for that. The Last Emperox series is good but Old Man‚Äôs War is simply on another level. The world building around the CDF and the war fought by humanity is amazing. God I really hope they make this into a series and I hope they get Aaron Sorkin to write it because he can definitely bring to life Scalzi‚Äôs dialog's. 

The Old Man‚Äôs War series is so human. \[SPOILERS\] Humanities quest to adapt and survive is really shown off in this book with Brainpal and the modifications the soldiers go through.  

Humanity it seems can never get war out of our genes. No matter where we go we seem to stoke or cultivate conflict. I enjoy reading about skip drives and enhanced special forces strategies and tactics but I wonder, for those of you who have read the book, what do you think? 

The decisions made by Perry, Sagan and the colonists on Roanoke. Do you think the CDF should have joined the conclave which sounds to me like a version of the Federation (which I love). I find myself at odds with the decisions made in the series. I cannot stop wondering why didn‚Äôt humans attempt to form a conclave themselves and instead picked war?

I believe in the best of humanity and this book in some ways highlights what happens if the worst of us wins somehow. I would like to believe that if our civilization was actually in the same position as the book we would make better decisions. We would choose to elevate ourselves above the warring factions rather than join them and reach an evolutionary standstill locked in by war. 

Once I finish ‚ÄúThe Last Colony‚Äù I am going to head out and get the other 3 books in the series to discover what happens to John Perry and the rest of humanity so no spoilers please (if possible).",books,3693

" Hi all, I don't know if this topic is feasible to discuss here. In my reading experience, I found that I would more prefer to read the hard copy version for a book. I would like to change the habit, but I feel anxious while reading the e-book from kindle.

I think it was because usually when I read the hard copy book, the reading sequence was not linear. I would take a quick view of a paragraph and set the reading goal within the limited reading time, and further judged that if the paragraph is worth reading or not.

When it comes to kindle, I cant not quick to turn the pages and saw different titles or subjects of sections. I also could not check the reading goal's progress (the hard copy could easily judgement by the page number or thick position of the book). That makes me feel my reading speed is low and anxious.

Did any person have the same feeling as me? And, how do you handle it? Many thanks for any suggestions, sharing or skill.

"I thought it was amazing. I admit, I was initially skeptical of the concept but I loved World War Z so much that I had to give it a chance. It's been a long time since I've read World War Z, but I think I like Devolution better. It certainly had better characters and character development, but that's to be expected, I suppose, due to the different structures of the books. Moster ended up being my favorite character. I just couldn't stop reading it and blew through it in two days.

If I'm being honest, I think the last act wasn't as strong as the rest of the book, but it was still solid the whole way through. If I were to read it again, a little more critically, I could probably find more faults. Perhaps the character turns were a little too abrupt, or the action a little unclear at times. All in all though I don't have any major complaints.

I've spent my share of time in the mountains so the idea of being abruptly isolated and forced to survive in those conditions, and how people act in those situations, rang true to me. I love the idea of urban city dwellers using modern technical conveniences to live a cushy carefree life in the secluded mountains only to be abruptly cut off from civilization's supply chains and forced to fend for their own.

"&gt;*Have you heard about the Stillmind? The One Who Gathers?*   They traded food for information, rallied curious crowds to make mass   pilgrimages into the strange lands to see if they could find out more.   Someone in this apartment had scrawled *The One with a Middle but No Beginning*   in charcoal over where the bed should have been. Ory touched the tail   of one smudged letter softly, powdering his fingertip in dark gray.   Those few left with shadows were just the opposite, he thought. All   beginning, no middle. Middle had become an ever-shifting, never-ending   apocalypse.

Peng Shepherd‚Äôs debut novel, *The Book of M*,  came highly  recommended to me by many members of my book club, and I  can certainly  see why. The novel has a killer premise: one day, in a  market in India, a  man‚Äôs shadow disappeared. It enraptured the world,  gluing people to the  24-hour news cycle. Then more and more people  began losing their  shadows, and after a few days, the delight turned  into horror as the  shadowless‚Äîas they would come to be called‚Äîstarted  losing their memories  too. Their amnesia, which progresses without  rhyme or reason, can cause  them to forget anything from their own name  to their ability to  breathe.

The  story follows the perspective of 4 characters: a nameless man who   suffered from extensive retrograde amnesia through the regular way   (i.e. traumatic brain damage); an Iranian archer and Olympic hopeful   named Naz; and finally, Ory and Max, a couple who had survived for 2   years in a hotel deep in a forest where they were attending a wedding,   right when the Forgetting reached a pandemic pitch. The resulting book   is a unique blend of dystopian fiction and fantasy. I had initially   thought it might be science fiction and there are parts of the book that   certainly flirted with that aspiration, but science and *The Book of M* never got past their meet cute, and the book totally stood sci-fi up on their first date.

The best way to explain my feelings on this book is to bring up [something SFF author Jo Walton wrote](http://www.jowaltonbooks.com/genre-pacing-a-question-from-goodreads/) on the nature of science fiction (and fantasy):

&gt;In  science fiction, the world is a  character, and characters have to  change and so the world has to  change, or at the very least be  interrogated and examined and seen all  around the way a character would  be. The author has to have thought  about why things work that way. The  reader doesn‚Äôt have to be given the  answers, but the answers, the  world answers, need to have been in the  author‚Äôs mind, and it‚Äôs quite  clear when they are not, because the world  will not be consistent in a  way that would fit with their being an  explanation. And really, we SF  readers expect an actual explanation at  some point. Sometimes the  explanation is deeply disappointing. There are  a lot of books out there  with questions that are much more interesting  than their answers ‚Äî a  whole lot of Sheri Tepper, for instance, or Dan  Simmons‚Äôs *Hyperion* series.  
But  we expect these questions to be answered.Whereas in genre LitFic, those  world questions are just scenery, and the whole structure of what \[Kate  Atkinson, author of *Life After Life*\]   is doing isn‚Äôt for anything, or it‚Äôs for creating emotional resonance   in the reader ‚Äî which it does really well. Having resolved the  emotional  plot, she thinks the reader will be happy ‚Äî and she‚Äôs right,  the reader  of women‚Äôs fiction and of LitFic will be happy, but the SF  reader will  be asking ‚ÄúWait, what was this all about? What was the  point? Why was  she going through all these versions of her life? Did I  just read a  whole book and you‚Äôre not even going to give me the answer?  What was it  all for?‚Äù  
‚ÄîGenre Pacing: A question from Goodreads (2018), an essay by Jo Walton

I don‚Äôt believe in spoiling books, and I won‚Äôt reveal the plot details of what happens in *The Book of M*   or how it ends, but I believe that reviews need to help readers decide   if the book in question is one they would enjoy‚Äîand to manage   expectations so they would not be disappointed at the end of an almost   500-page book. So, to rip the band-aid off here, *The Book of M*   does not explain anything. There are no explanations offered on why   shadows began disappearing, or how shadows relate to memory. There is   also no consistency to how the Forgetting works, particularly how the   loss of memory relates to reality-bending powers that the shadowless   would come to acquire. When a character in the story forgets that a   marketplace exists, the marketplace and everyone in it just disappears.   Yet, when individuals forget that they need to breathe or eat to   survive, they die instead of rewriting reality into one in which they do   not need these vital functions to live. How Ms Shepherd chose which   seems to depend on which outcome would bring the most dramatic tension.   This may not bother people who are unfamiliar with sci-fi and fantasy,   but in reality, we readers of SFF understand more than most that extra   care often has to be exercised when magic is part of world-building.   Because without rules or consistency, magic just becomes a writer‚Äôs   get-out-of-jail-free card for any adversity the characters‚Äô face.

Now,  I don‚Äôt want to get into a soft magic versus hard magic debate,  and I  do believe great works of fantasy can feature soft magic, but an  issue  that I personally have with *The Book of M*  is how it walks  and talks like a world that have rules, and when its  rules changed, it  seemed like it may have an answer why. But it really  doesn‚Äôt. That  doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not a good book, mind you. It simply  means that it may  not be a satisfactory read for those who are  accustomed to authors who  thought about the structure of their worlds  beyond their service to the  story and plot.

&gt;*Life After Life*  is a  literary novel and it is deeply unsatisfactory as science fiction   because it grabs a shiny tool from science fiction‚Äôs toolbox and waves   it around as if it were meaningful and then just drops it. But it‚Äôs a   wonderful novel with a level of characterisation and literary  excitement  that you only see in the very best SF.  
‚ÄîGenre Pacing: A question from Goodreads (2018), an essay by Jo Walton

Similar to how Ms Walton felt about *Life After Life*, *The Book of M*   features excellent character writing that really gets to the core of   what these characters are about. It was easy for me to get fully   invested in Max‚Äôs, Ory‚Äôs, and the nameless amnesiac‚Äôs journey, though I   felt that Naz‚Äôs story peaked in the first act, and she was just waiting   around in the wings until she became relevant again in the book‚Äôs  final  chapters. Max and Ory‚Äôs story form the emotional spine of the  book, and I  particularly enjoy Max‚Äôs first-person perspective as she  continuously  talks into a tape recorder about her feelings and  experiences, all while  her grasp on her memories slackens progressively  inch by heartbreaking  inch. I often imagine her sounding like the  narrator of the supernatural  horror podcast *Alice Isn‚Äôt Dead*  who is also on the road and  missing a spouse. Jasika Nicole‚Äôs voice is  soothing and mellow, with an  undercurrent of sorrow and regret‚Äîperfect  for Max.

In spite of the book‚Äôs  length, it is decently paced with only the  merest sag in the middle,  and Ms Shepherd is a deft hand at employing  every trick in a creative  writer‚Äôs utility belt in getting me to turn  page after page late into  the night. She often begins a chapter or  passage by telling you  something shocking or unexpected had happened,  before going into the  how and why. Also, I could tell she had a lot of  fun imagining a world  twisted by the power of the shadowless‚Äô  misrememberings, and gave us  imagery that are dreamlike, bizarre and  borderline Lovecraftian, like  this,

&gt;‚ÄúDid  you know that now the  crocodiles are the size of cruise ships? But  they‚Äôre lit up like them  too, and you can hear the music from a mile  away. They‚Äôre probably in  more danger of extinction now than they were  before, even though they  are a hundred times more terrifying. Probably  the only thing they can  catch is one another.‚Äù

This,

&gt;In  the dirt behind us, tiny little  lightbulbs the size of grapes were  pushing slowly through the earth,  unfurling like new crops. Farther  back, a carved porcelain teacup the  size of a freighter sailed silently  past the sky like a cloud, its  smooth, rounded lip tilted at a  graceful angle.

Or this,

&gt;I  was holding perfectly still,  under the spell of that feeling, just  watching my shadow. It was looking  back at me, in the same pose,  waiting.  
Then I saw it tilt its head ever so slightly to the side, all by itself.  
There   was a moment of coldness, like the entire room had dropped twenty   degrees. I tried to take a breath, but I couldn‚Äôt move. Then it was   gone.

Ms Shepherd  also drew a lot resonance from our cultural fascination  with shadows,  both literary and mythic, and her references ranged from  Zero Shadow  Day, J. M. Barrie‚Äôs *Peter Pan*,  and the Rigvedic  tale of the Hindu sun god Surya, and his consorts  Sanjna, and Chhaya.  Chhaya is the goddess of shadow, and her name in  Sanskrit literally  means shadow too. That is amusing to me because the  Malay word *cahaya* (which I am familiar with) is derived from it, and yet, *cahaya* means light, which is the opposite of a shadow. What was I trying to say with that trivia about *cahaya*?   I don‚Äôt know but it sure sounds profound‚Äîmaybe something about   reflections and opposites? And that is how I feel about the literary   subtext underlying *The Book of M*. For example, there are ideas derived from the apocryphal saying *‚Äúan elephant never forgets‚Äù*   and there were spooky happenings that seem to suggest the existence of  a  pachydermic hive mind, but that never really went anywhere either.  And  at one point, a character is able to converse with animals, though  that  kinda petered out too.

In  fact, with the exception of the vedic story, everything about the   nameless amnesiac‚Äôs journey felt vaguely unsatisfying to me, and it   bothered me right from the very beginning when he was flown to India by   his doctor to meet the first man who lost his shadow and memories‚Äîwith   the hope that a conversation between the two would spark some sort of   psychological breakthrough while they were hooked up to electrodes. As a   medical practitioner, I must say that seemed all too unrealistic and   cartoonish to me. Also, I wondered about the dearth of physicists in the   process of unravelling *The Book of M*‚Äòs  central mystery. Where  are the Neil DeGrasse Tysons and Brian  Coxes‚Äîthe hard science boffins  that would be all up the shadowless  people‚Äôs well-lit wazoos, measuring  photons and whatnot?

Another  aspect that Ms Shepherd shines in is when she explores the  different  ways people cope in a world in which most people have lost  their  shadows and memories, while society have utterly collapsed because  not  enough people remember how it works. People naturally bunched up  into  their little ideological *Mad Max*\-style  tribes, clinging  onto whichever shred of belief or hope that sounded  rightest to them  because the absence concrete answers in the face of  uncertainty will  send all of us to the lap of whichever fiction that  gives us the most  comfort. Some tried to treat the Forgetting like an  infectious disease,  instituting quarantines and even exterminating the  ‚Äúinfected‚Äù. Some may  see as part of a divine plan, and build cults  around it. It‚Äôs the same  reason why there are people who believe that  COVID-19 is caused by 5G  cell towers‚Äîbecause those are infinitely  easier to destroy than a  faceless, formless, planet-spanning virus.

When I read the ending of the book (which I‚Äôll admit, got me *good*),   I immediately understood why so many reviewers of this book on   Goodreads said that they thought they would give this book 5 out of 5   stars when they started, but ultimately ended up giving it a more   middling score. I actually found the one-two punch of the intended   conclusion to be devastatingly powerful, and it does pay off the vedic   stuff narratively, even if it remained disinterested in the   philosophical questions the book raised: What makes a person? Is it our   memories or our bodies? The book seems to shrug its metaphorical   shoulders and then went off to fly a deathkite. Nevertheless, I still   think this is a tremendously written work (considering that this is a   debut) but it could stand to lose a hundred pages or so of fat. I for   one am excited that *The Book of M*  had been optioned for TV, and  I can‚Äôt wait to see that scene with the  Statue of Liberty. If you have  read this book, you know exactly what I  am talking about.

Rating: 3.5/5 stars",books,12925
"Just wondering out loud if the old books are still being read. Still Life with Woodpecker, Another Roadside Attraction,  Jitterbug Perfume and Even Cowgirls Get the Blues, were cult classics in the mid/late '70s.
Can highly recommend them to anyone looking for something completely different. Would love to hear others take on his books. They seem, to me at least, as applicable today as they were 50 years ago. Also incredibly funny and full of great quotes:

"I've really enjoyed most of Card's work. Memory of Earth was heavy handed in the religious parallelism (more than he usually even does), most of the characters felt at best 1.5 dimensional, and the world building seemed haphazard. It feels like if I read through it I'm just going to end up reading through a sci-punk fan-fic version of Moses leading his people from Egypt.

"This book completely shattered me. The style of narration is flawless, and I found myself slowing down as I read it, trying to savour every word, every chapter to its fullest. It was on my mind every second I wasn't reading it, and I had to force myself to pace just so that it can last longer. I don't think I have ever felt this much because of a book in my life; it's left me empty and is definitely the most beautiful and heart wrenching book I've read.",books,457

"Hey, everyone! Rant time. Sorry if I made any mistakes, English isn't my first language.

I am part of a Facebook group (in my country FB is probably the main chatting platform) where people discuss the books they have read or are planning to read. I've got tons of great recommendations from there (including one of my favourite authors) but I feel like the community there is getting progressively more and more toxic.

People post mostly pictures there. A lot of people (predominantly younger women) try to make their pictures as aesteticly pleasing as possible. This usiually includes pictures on the beach, with a pet, with a variety of decorations, etc. I don't have a problem with this because I put more thought into the book rather than the picture. However, I do like a nicely done photograph.

Where's the issue though? The loud majority of the group (consisting mainly of older women) love to put down the younger women who post these types of pictures. They consider themselves holier-than-thou because they consume literature. What is confusing to me is - why do they feel the need to be so rude and disrespectful towards these girls? I thought people who pride themselves on their intelligence wouldn't fall so low as to make ugly and crude comments on another persons education and intelligence, calling them derogatory names, or implying that they don't read but are just looking for ""male attention"". Just because of a picture.

I understand if you dislike these types of pictures. But don't try to ruin someone's day because of an innocent post on FB. That I don't understand...

Not all older women in the group are like this - a lot of them call out these types of comments even, so I'm not trying to generalize. I just feel really uncomfortable in this type of judgemental environment.

Is it excusable for a person to act so entitled just because they are a reader? I haven't noticed this type of behavior on Reddit so I'm curious to know what you think about this whole situation. :)",books,2007
"Starting from when my school started teaching literary analysis, I did not really believe in ""in-depth analysis"". An example of what I mean is a book that I skimmed past online, which analyzed Kafka's writing in The Trial. One part that struck me hard was how he ""analyzed"" one of the book's segments about the layout of the courtroom to be a reference to some Jewish tradition and drawing out the concepts of that.

&amp;#x200B;

In a quora comment, someone even stated he believed the Trial was actually a dream/hallucination by the author. Both examples which I stated I found astonishingly stupid, that they precipitate principles which are simply not there, and draw parallels out of coincidences.

&amp;#x200B;

"I don't have anyone to discuss this with, so I really needed to rant here at least. After rewatching CMBYN I decided to read the original novel version to compare. I was surprised how similar much of it was (lots of dialogue being pulled word-for-word), but what *really* got me was everything from Oliver's departure and beyond.

The movie gives us a heartbreaking, brief, practically silent glimpse at Elio and Oliver's separation at the train station. We then flash forward to the winter phonecall and the conclusion of Oliver announcing his marriage. It's tragic, but the viewer has some semblance of closure: we see them part, we see Oliver commit to someone else, and we see Elio at the very beginning of his grief/process of moving on. We can draw appropriate conclusions and be at peace.

In the book, however, we don't see the separation *at all*. In one moment the couple is drunkenly gallivanting around Rome, and in the next moment Elio is back in his home without Oliver. The transition was so sudden, so jarring, that I had to go back and re-read to make sure I didn't miss something. I actually *love* how the book handled this, even compared to the movie portrayal which was excellent. 

The separation is one of the *most* anticipated moments. It looms over the story like a guillotine and you anxiously await it as you turn each page. Surely such a fraught, slow-burn relationship will end with a dramatic goodbye right? Nope, you don't even get to see it. One moment he's there, then suddenly he's gone. The reader is placed directly into Elio's shoes asking the same questions he must have surely asked: ""Wait, that's it? It's over? He's already gone? But the summer just started! They just fell in love! Can't they have just a few days more? A meaningful, tearful goodbye where they swear to never forget the other?"" It's like slipping from a warm and bubbly hot tub into an ice-cold pool.

And if this jarring transition wasn't painful enough, we are then subject to the excruciating reality of time speeding up and racing by as these two characters veer off to separate lives before inevitably crashing back together for brief, tragic reminiscing on what was and what could have been... and then they separate once more, and so on. It's like living the nightmare we all fear: What if I lose ""the one"" and we never find each other again? What could life have been?

It's so hard to re-read this book because it destroys me emotionally, but I have so much appreciation for the artistic direction Aciman took this story. The ending is so beautifully tragic, despite the relatively ""low stakes"" to it all, and *so much* is communicated through the absence of expected scenes.",books,2694

"
I admit, I am one of those people that never thought twice about the book, until the new movie adaption came out. For years I‚Äôve kept the bow of never watching a movie before reading the book it‚Äôs based on (if I can help it.) This was no exception. So I plunged headlong in the depths of Alcott‚Äôs book, not really knowing what to expect.

First, I will try to review the book without getting into any spoilers. 

I first need to specify that I LOVE 19th century literature. Dickens is an author that I‚Äôve had a literary crush on for decades. I am used to and even love the long-winded descriptions and poetic over-detailing that authors of that century got into. I knew to expect that out of Alcott‚Äôs book as well. What I was NOT expecting was the immense boredom that I suffered through while reading this book! It was only 400 pages, yet it felt like 4000. Every chapter (I try to complete a chapter in one sitting) was just plain painful. The excitement I usually feel when reading the last couple of pages from a book was this time exchanged with an excitement for finally being able to stop reading. 
  I don‚Äôt quite know why this book was so boring to me. I think it was partially because a lot of sections were just too preachy; maybe because a lot of times Alcott would go into a long-winded description of a scene that wasn‚Äôt really necessary, or had little to no payoff. 
I never expected a book with the subject matter that this book has to be exceptionally action-packed or dynamic, but you can always have a lot of character development, or story development even with minimalistic settings or plots. 

The characters were not very developed. Yes, a few of them were interesting enough, but I think that was mostly due to the fact that the rest of the characters were just so bland, that these few were made to look interesting by comparison. 

Here I have to point something out. Alcott write this book with money in mind, not because she really had something to say. This is a well/ known fact. She designed ‚ÄúLittle Women‚Äù with the one main purpose of making money. All the preachiness is due to this. For the mid-19th century society, girls were supposed to only read books that would teach them how to grow into proper ladies. And every single lesson that comes out from the pages of this book is expressly designed to do just that- to teach its female readers how to be prom and proper. So, for this alone the book will get some praise from me- it does what it was designed to do. It‚Äôs extremely vanilla, but that‚Äôs to be expected from a book of its caliber. 

&gt;! Now, I will talk about the book in more detail.

The only characters I took some fragment of interest in were Jo, Beth, Lorrie and Mr Baehr. Everyone else was either too bland (Meg), or not developed enough (Mr March). 

Very little stood out to me in this book. Therefore, I will only talk about a few things.

1. Someone said that they didn‚Äôt like how the heroins were forced to give up their interests for the sake of getting married. Here, they are talking about Beth and Amy giving up writing and drawing respectively. I disagree with that. At the end of the book, both say that they haven‚Äôt given up their dreams, they simply have other things that they are equally aspiring to. I think that the main thing that Alcott preaches in the book, when it comes to big aspirations is humility. Both Amy and Jo are taught humility through multiple challenges. It is especially evident in Jo, who ‚Äúonly writes well when not writing for money, but for simple self-gratification instead.‚Äù 

2. The humility is most evident in the tragic character of Beth. I think that the only part in the nook that was somewhat emotional for me was Beth‚Äôs death. The last few paragraphs concerning hear peaceful death in her mother‚Äôs arms were exceptionally beautiful. 

3. Jo spurring Laurie‚Äôs affection was definitely something I wasn‚Äôt expecting and thus was pleasantly surprised. There was only one really weird thing that kept being repeated in the book- ‚Äúfirst love is the strongest.‚Äù That kind of rained in Amy‚Äôs love for Laurie and kind of created a love triangle between her, Laurie, and Jo. For some reason I felt like Alcott tried to point out that Laurie still has feelings for Jo, which in turn made it feel like he was simply settling for Amy because he couldn‚Äôt have Jo.

4. Speaking of Laurie and Amy, their love kind of came out of nowhere. Yeast, they had some moments alone together in Niece, but they otherwise never really shared a scene together before that. If anything, Laurie had more feelings for either Beth or Meg in the first book, but never really got Amy. The only instance I can think of was when he would visit Amy while Beth is sick with scarlet fever.

5. Lastly, I want to talk about my favorite paring in the book- Jo and Baehr. It‚Äôs an interesting pairing, given the 20 year age gap, but it strangely works. I really enjoyed Baehr‚Äôs Hagrid-like character. And I really enjoyed reading about his friendship with Jo that slowly developed into a romantic relationship. Honestly, that was the most invested I was throughout the whole book. !&lt;

Lastly, I will rate the book. 5 categories, 1-5 stars for each category. Averaging out all 5 ratings will give me the final rating.

1. Writing (how well I liked the writing style/ how easy was it for me to read the book) 1 star. I had a horrible experience reading this book. Quite possibly the most boring book I‚Äôve ever read.

2. Themes (how well the themes were developed/ did they come through well/did I agree with the themes) The themes were definitely well thought out. I could totally tell where Alcott was going with everything and what she was trying to convey. Though I disagree with quite a few of the themes (complete selflessness, devotion to God, etc.) I will give the book 3 stars on that.

3. Characters (how well were the characters written) Though very bland, there were a few characters I was invested in, so I‚Äôm giving it 4 stars here.

4. Plot (was the plot interesting; was I invested) The plot of the book was kind of boring. It‚Äôs as if Alcott spent more time and effort on the morals and themes, rather than the story. 2 stars.

5. Emotion (I am a pretty emotional person, every book makes me feel something) I would‚Äôve quickly dismissed this section with 1 Star, but &gt;! Beth‚Äôs death and Jo and Baehr‚Äôs romance !&lt; add an additional star. 3 stars. 

Average: 2.6 Stars",books,6446
"I love classic books, my favorite author is Poe by far, and I actually think that the hunger games are a cool trilogy. Like it's a very good start for a beginner, it's an interesting story and not very stereotypical, and easy to read. I enjoyed them a lot reading them, I think that's what really matters at the end. Teen's books like that actually make a lot of young people interested in reading, my friend actually started reading Jane Austen because she loved the romance and wanted more, soo, unpopular opinion but some teenagers books don't deserve so much hate.

"For the last few years, I‚Äôve been really into reading and analyzing classic literature. I find it almost enlightening to see the ways human nature and discourse has changed or, rather, remained the same throughout the centuries. However, I usually have bad luck with Barnes and Noble copies, and Penguin books can often get expensive or hard to find. There‚Äôs nothing more frustrating to me than ruining cheap, flimsy binding halfway through a book - usually because the publisher can‚Äôt be asked to spend more than a dollar on printing. 

I recently discovered Arcturus books, which is a publishing company that releases specialized paperback editions of classic literature. They each have their own unique cover design with a fundamentalist, cartoony aesthetic that is super pleasing to the eye - and the binding is on par with some of the best in modern printing. They‚Äôre honestly such a joy to read, and they aren‚Äôt an eyesore on the shelf - especially when lined up together.

My one complaint is the lack of annotations, but it really just depends on the book and translation being used.

Am I the only one who likes these?",books,1127
"Novels that fail to satisfy our expectations deserve a spot next to bad cigars and unrequited love as representative of life's most painful letdowns. 

Brief backstory - I'm one of these nuts that's actually sort of enjoying quarantine. Working from home means more time with loved ones, staying up/sleeping in later, saying goodbye to a crummy commute and - OF COURSE - more time to kick back and read great books!

This being the case, I'm sure you can understand the excitement that gripped me back in June when I heard tell of a mysterious novel starring a legendary mountain man and his solo war of revenge against an entire Native American tribe. Sometimes a good ole, American Civil War-era horror show is exactly what I require.

Taken from the blurb on the back cover of my copy of¬†*Crow Killer: The Saga¬†Of¬†Liver-Eating Johnson*:

‚Äú*Standing 6‚Äô2‚Äù in his stocking feet and weighing nearly 250 pounds, he was a mountain man among mountain men, one of the toughest customers on the western frontier. As the story goes, one morning in 1847 Johnson returned to his Rocky Mountain trapper‚Äôs cabin to find the remains of his murdered Indian wife and her unborn child. He vowed vengeance against an entire Indian tribe.¬†Crow Killer¬†tells of that one-man, decades-long war to avenge his family*.‚Äù

To make matters more awesome, Johnson ate the raw livers of every Crow Indian he killed.¬†His strange choice of food was not for lack of snacks. The God of the Crow People barred the gates of heaven to all tribesmen that departed the Great Plains sans the accompaniment of their holy organ.¬†So, when Johnson plucked the livers from the abdomens of the slain Indians he was - for all intents and purposes - sending them to hell.¬†

After reading the plot of *Crow Killer*, I immediately ordered a copy. There is little chance that a book with such bitching source material could be anything less than a riveting read, I thought. 

Unfortunately, compelling source material can‚Äôt cover up hurt of bad writing. *Crow Killer* is boring. It's so boring I abandoned it at the halfway mark. Have you ever suffered through the unhappy experience of reading a novel that becomes less engaging the more your read it? It's like the book loses a bit of it's charm every time you turn a page. The more you learn about the characters the less interesting the become! That sounds like it should be impossible! I assure you it's not.

Author, Raymond W. Thorp, appears to have been born and raised in California, but he could have fooled me. His writing is so awkward and his word placements are so bizarre it‚Äôs like English is his second or even third language. Thorp's writing is ugly. It's not grammatically incorrect or overwritten in a cringy sort of way - it's just plain ugly on the eyes. I not sure how else to put it. It's like Thorp understands the basic rules of plotting and narrative structure, but he's also deaf to the text-music of prose. It feels like Thorp never took the time to build rapport with his own book.

The interesting aspects of the character‚Äôs personalities are left unexplored. Potentially interesting moments in the biography of Johnson are glossed over while minutia is dragged out for pages and pages. Worst of all, for a book that takes place in Civil War era America,¬†*Crow Killer*¬†provides very little in the way of worthwhile content for history buffs to sink their teeth into.¬†

The book is just bad, period ‚Äì at least up until the point when I stopped reading it, of course! Is that lazy? Yes, probably. So be it! Life is way too short to justify apathetically clopping your way through hours of a bad novel for the pitiable prize of not feeling a bit lazy!

What about you guys? How often do you pitch a book before you finish it? I don't do it too often. Maybe one out of every five books that I start are left unfinished. 

P.S. *Crow Killer* has earned itself very favorable reviews on Amazon. So, maybe I'm the odd man out for not enjoying this book. I have a feeling that a lot of the people that read and enjoy this book are niche readers. Like, people that hold a particular fascination for mountain men, American pioneers and surviving the untamed wilderness were probably going to get a kick out of this book - form be damned.",books,4258

"I‚Äôm reading, ‚ÄúThe Stand‚Äù because it came highly recommended but I am having such a hard time simply picking it up and reading it. I‚Äôm not going to quit it, but I really want to. I‚Äôm currently reading some books in between but I‚Äôm having such a hard time with his writing style. I know it comes with the time that it was written, but I find it really harsh and borderline crude. I enjoy the story and plot, but I can‚Äôt get over his writing.

"I‚Äôll hopefully explain my question here a little better than what I can in the title. I‚Äôm currently reading Different Seasons by Stephen King. It‚Äôs a collection of short stories, some of which have had film adaptations like Shawshank Redemption and Stand by Me. I recently finished Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption when I had a realization come over me; the ‚Äúmovie‚Äù that played out in my head as I read the book starred the actors from the movie. 

For example, the book describes one of the main characters, Red, as being a red-headed Irishman. In the movie, he‚Äôs played by Morgan Freeman. Had I read the book first, I‚Äôm sure I would have envisioned him as he is described in the book, however, as I played out the scenes in my head, I only ever saw Morgan Freeman. The same can be said for every other character as well. The book takes place over many years and many prison wardens. In the movie, and in my mind, there was only ever the one. 

The same can be said for other books as well. In Holes, Stanley Yelnats is described as being overweight and then losing that weight as he digs holes. That‚Äôs how I saw him when I read it as a kid. Now when I read the book, I can only ever envision Shia LeBeouf. 

So I guess what I‚Äôm asking is, have any of you overcome this behavior? I‚Äôd like to read the book the way the author intended it but I can‚Äôt help but let the movie adaptations influence my reading.",books,1416
"Tl;dr: I finally learned a trick to stop sub vocalizing and I wonder if anyone else knows any other way to help me read faster. 
So, I'm a young guy and have only been speaking english fluently for about 5 years. Over the last couple of years, I've been drawn more and more to reading books as a source of valuable information, life lessons, and entertainment. The only downside to this is that every time I get the urge to start reading, I keep it up for a few days and then stop due to the fact that i become frustrated since i cant read my faster. A few months ago i learned that what was holding me back was subvocalisation (reading words out loud in your head) and of course, i went to the internet to see if there was a way to stop this. Today, just now actually, I came across this video and after trying all the tricks other videos proposed (to no avail) this one finally helped. The guy said, just put the tip of your tongue on the roof of your mouth and boom, I tried a reading test and i was much faster. So, I come now to ask for more help, are there other ways to stop sub vocalizing that dont need a special trick? And if so, what are they?

"On my second readthrough of this novel (my first was about two years ago, I think around the time the movie came out) and I‚Äôm noticing that, at least in this first book of his, Kevin Kwan‚Äôs writing is... just not great. 

What stands out most to me is the odd imbalance of dialogue. Characters have massive streams of chatter amongst themselves, during which he fails to break it up with descriptions of action ‚Äî although he does try, and the attempts almost make it worse. Every few lines there‚Äôll be an instance of speech followed by a brief and sloppy action within the same sentence; as if Kwan knows he‚Äôs creating an imbalance but doesn‚Äôt care to actually interject with an action-specific paragraph. The verb usage to describe how dialogue is delivered is EXCESSIVE and occurs almost every time someone speaks and is especially difficult to get through. 

As such, the novel is full of pages that read like: ‚Äúdialogue dialogue‚Äù, she retorted, shooting her husband a look. ‚Äúdialogue dialogue‚Äù she conceded. ‚Äúdialogue dialogue‚Äù she exclaimed after giving it another moment‚Äôs thought.

I‚Äôm not even trying to be nitpicky, but I have to know if anyone else has noticed this in his writing or at least in this debut work, maybe before he really got a feel for his own style (haven‚Äôt read anything else by Kwan so I‚Äôm not sure if this stuff persists). It‚Äôs just bothering me! I really want to enjoy the story because it‚Äôs definitely interesting, I loved it during my first read, I love the movie, etc. I guess I‚Äôm just looking for solidarity here, haha. Anyone?",books,1561
"I finally got around to reading Octavia Butler's *Bloodchild* and I....am....haunted? Disturbed? It'll stay with me, whatever the word is. I'm reminded of how I felt after Harlan Ellison's *I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream*.

Anyway, I had a revelation. I should preface by saying I'm a white, moderate-but-liberal-leaning female. I have frequently read that this story is a metaphor for slavery, for the continuing relationship between blacks and whites in America. I like reading things at face value for my first read through, so I went into it with an open mind and certainly didn't apply that interpretation as I read. Then I read her afterword, and the very first sentence addressed that assumed metaphor...and she made it clear that this did  *not* have anything to do with what she was thinking as she wrote the story. She went on to talk about random thoughts and questions that have plagued her, about botflies in the Amazon, and thinking about pregnant men...and I was struck by how relatable her thinking and story-creation process is.

And I immediately realized the obvious--Octavia Butler is first and foremost a science fiction writer. She happens to be black and female. While some male,female, white, black, latinx, etc authors may choose to thread that part of themselves into their writing, it's wrong to assume they do. When we make that assumption, say about Butler, we pigeonhole her into this slot of *black science fiction author*, instead of *science fiction author*. Every author should have the freedom to let their work stand on its own, apart from the author's identity. Otherwise, we strip the author of their autonomy, of their ability to think beyond their personal social constructs. 

I guess this hit me hard because I'm naturally drawn to this interpretation and always have been...that an author's work should be viewed in light of their background and identity. Maybe not. I think I need to reexamine some of the classics and how I read them...

I'm interested in hearing your thoughts...have you read the short story? How do you interpret it? Of course one method of interpretation is that the reader determines the interpretation, and Butler has even commented that she believes the reader has *at least as much* power as she does when creating meaning from her stories. Idk. But I'm curious what others have to say! Share with me! :)",books,2377
"Recently I read Drive Your Plow Over The Bones of The Dead by Olga Tokarczuk and Death In Her Hands by Ottessa Moshfegh and found many similarities between the books. Both books are written from the first person perspective of reclusive old women, both women have animal companions, and both have a somewhat dismal attitude. Both of the books' plots center around the old woman discovering a murder and becoming consumed by it, fantasizing about the crime and the lives of the killer and victim. To me, the craziest similarity between them is that they both feature the old woman studying the same William Blake poem. I just thought I would share this realization I had. Does anyone know if anything has been written about this or if either author has spoken about it?",books,768
"Recently Amazon‚Äôs packaging has turned to crap. I have returned 3 books lately and on the last I took a refund rather than a replacement.

I‚Äôm looking for packing that prevents denting, folding, and tearing of the items. Even if the return policy is good and shipping fast, getting a bashed up book is beyond annoying and waiting for a replacement that may just as bad or worse is beyond frustrating.

"I recently picked up ‚ÄúThe Bridge Kingdom‚Äù by Danielle Jenson and found it enjoyable enough... until now. I‚Äôm 86% of the way in and I know everything‚Äôs about to go downhill REAL fast.

So‚Äîand I know this is a strange request, but‚Äîcould someone kindly spoil the ending for me? I‚Äôve just finished chapter 34 and Aren has just alluded to taking Laura ‚Äúhome‚Äù to what I assume to be Eranahl.

This is my [likely fallible] understanding of the ending:
*spoilers (?) ahoy*
- Laura‚Äôs father receives the letter with ~top secret info~
- Maridrina attacks Ithicana and seizes the bridge
- Aren and friends discover Laura‚Äôs involvement, probably through her father or the Magpie because ~dramatic~. Aren‚Äôs heartbroken; those who survived the attack now perceive Laura to be a traitor. Which she kinda is, so valid.
- Laura escapes and is now in exile as an enemy to Ithicana. Aren is taken hostage, but Laura has no idea?

" 

Believing that Hayd√©e has for him only ‚Äúthe love and tenderness of a daughter‚Äù, Monte Cristo understands for the first time that she might love him for real when he sees her concern for him the night before the duel and carries her in his arms to her apartment (‚Äúthe idea occurred to him for the first time, that perhaps she loved him otherwise than as a daughter loves a father‚Äù, ch.90). He regretfully concludes that he might have had a chance to be loved and therefore to be happy (‚Äú‚ÄòAlas‚Äô, murmured he, with intense suffering,‚ÄòI might, then, have been happy yet‚Äô‚Äù, ch.90). His happiness to see her, when he returns from the duel, is not less intense than hers, although not as evident. Kissing her forehead makes both their hearts beat strongly (‚Äúa kiss which made two hearts throbat once, the one violently, the other\[silently\]‚Äù, ch.92) and he dares to believe that he can love again. This belief is confirmed after his journey into the past of his imprisonment. Already having overcome the doubts risen in him with Edouard‚Äôs death, he overcomes another doubt concerning the woman he loves: while passing by the village of the Catalans, he looks away and murmurs Hayd√©e‚Äôs name ‚Äúin a voice of tenderness, amounting almost to love‚Äù (ch.113).

I n the last chapter (ch.117), although he knows that he loves her, the Count is still not sure if she loves him back (in his own words, ‚Äúwhen we have suffered a long time, we have great difficulty in believing in \[happiness\]‚Äù, ch.3). Therefore, with his mission accomplished, Monte Cristo is determined to punish himself for the pain he caused to the innocents and leave her side, not wanting to allow his destiny to overshadow hers. He sets her free, restoring her position, fortune and name, and asks her to ‚Äúforget even my name, and be happy‚Äù. When she clearly confesses that she loves him, he accepts her redeeming love (‚ÄúLet it be, then, as you wish\[...\] Love me then, Haidee!‚Äú).

 Mercedes was past and the count was already in love with Haydee. The director of the Soviet version of the count of Monte Cristo had fallen in love with the actress who played Haydee and left his wife for her. Adultery could have happened in the book and the count abandoned Mercedes to be with Haydee. 

 Director Georgi Yungvald-Khilkevich planned to shoot the adventure film ""The Prisoner of Ch√¢teau d'If"" (–£–∑–Ω–∏–∫ –∑–∞–º–∫–∞ –ò—Ñ / Uznik zamka If), based on the novel The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas. The actors were all approved, except Concubina Haydee, the mistress Count of Monte Cristo. The girl had to look exotic, ""without the fire of emancipation in her eyes."" 

 The director and his team went to Uzbekistan and saw exactly what they were looking for in the choreographic school. At night, samples were taken and Nadira Mirzayeva, 17, was approved for the role of Haydee.Nadira was such a good miracle, and Khilkevich realized that at 52 he fell in love as a boy. And here is no surprise, the girl had chic clothes, she was the owner of great beauty. Nadira knew about her merits and how any woman used them skillfully. 

 At the time, the director was a family man, married who worked with him, they filmed together. Georgi does not want to try his luck, realizes that he cannot resist the charms of beauty and returns with his wife and assistants to Riga. Khilkevich starts filming the film, the wife tells her husband that without Haydee, the film is in danger of being broken. When the girl arrived on filming, the director openly starts to take care of her, shows signs of attention, and when he realizes that everything is serious and for a long time, he moves into Nadira's room. 

 The turbulent romance leads everyone to bewildered, they try to ""open their eyes"", saying that the actress needs papers, money, fame. If she gets it all, she'll leave him. Young and beautiful girl, she cannot love an older man, and even with some illnesses. And in the end, Georgi and Nadira lived in love and harmony for 27 years and everything to envy, gave birth to a wonderful daughter called Nina. But it was then, and in 1988 everyone was against the relationship, they said that Khilkevich is old enough to be Nadira's father. Khilkevich was 35 years older than she, Nadira only turned 17. 

 The girl's parents were also against their relationship at first, especially since Khilkevich was married. But the lovers did not pay attention to all the fights, Georgi knew for sure - this woman of his dreams, and no force can destroy his happiness. After filming, the girl returns to Tashkent. She is offered to work at the Uzbek state assembly ""Shodlik"". Khilkevich for six years would find his beloved, divided between her and his family. 

 Nadira's father came and asked him not to leave his daughter, he was very scared: the girl would not survive separating from his beloved. Georgy Yungvald-Khilkevich promised that he would marry her. Nadira, realizing the complexity of what was happening, did not expect that they could finally be together forever. She abandoned everything to go after him. 

 The girl loved Khilkevich sincerely and when she realized that she could no longer live like this, she left the ensemble and came to Georgi in Odessa. For his beloved, he rents an apartment and Nadira is not going anywhere without him. Lovers everywhere appear together, and in 1995 they formalized their relationship. They traveled half the world, they were in France, Germany, Italy, USA ... 

 It cannot be said that their lives consisted only of happy days. Khilkevich had a complex character, like most talented people. Nadira endured his depression, illness, always supported him and tried to be close in difficult times.  In 1997, Khilkevich filmed the movie Hit, music, love ... (–ê—Ñ–µ—Ä—ã, –º—É–∑—ã–∫–∞, –ª—é–±–æ–≤—å ...), where his wife Nadira plays the leading role - a young singer. On September 4, 1997, the couple had a daughter named Nina, whom they had long dreamed.

"This book tells the story of a soldier during the American Civil war.

He believes that ""this certain group of people"" should die, and that the world would be better without this group.

"Now that Netflix has put the NeverEnding Story back up, i wanted to get everyone's opinion on the Book vs Movie.

Like many of you, i grew up with fantastic (and the best) dark children fantasy, and this story was absolutely a part of that. Sure, we have nostalgia glasses, i'll be the first to admit that, but i also admit i love the book AND the movie equally. What surprises me is hearing how many people immediately turn around and hate the movie suddenly after reading the book. This doesn't make sense to me.

Even after reading the book finally, i feel exactly the same about the film. Is the book better? Hell yes, much better. The world is expanded, the themes are better imagined, it's darker, you dive deeper into the mythos, and, just like any other property, things are a bit different. But does that mean i don't like the film anymore? Of course not.

The Harry Potter books are vastly different from the movie series, but do people hate the films? Some, but not most. This is the reason i can still love the movie after i read the book, it's just a different version. If you want the original, read the book. If you want to see a different version that takes an alternate path, the movie is still great too.

Yes, i agree the film industry should stop changing the author's work. Believe me, i'm all for that. I'm a fantasy author myself, and i would be incredibly upset if my exact version wasn't made. And hopefully in the future that will change, but this is in the past. And even though the film changes quite a bit, i still love it for what it is. Somehow, they still made an awesome movie out of it despite the changes. Just like Harry Potter, or even Lord of the Rings which is also much different.

So no, of course i don't hate the film, of course it's not just nostalgia glasses, they are both great in their own way and i will love always love both of them! I'd love to hear all of your thoughts:)

And also, because i mentioned the author's original work, which would you all like to see more: 1. Keep the original film and just make a sequel covering the rest of the book, or 2. Make an entirely new tv series completely faithful to the original work?",books,2179

I‚Äôve been looking online to see if there is a list of things that were cut and couldn‚Äôt find anything.

They don't teach you how to know what's going on in someone else's mind. They don't teach you what to say to someone who's dying. They don't teach you anything worth knowing.‚Äù

"I picked up a copy a while ago after watching the Netflix series, understanding full well that it's a loose adaptation and an all together different story, but I still loved the show so much I wanted to give the book a shot.

I'm about 100 pages in and wondering why some of the dialogue and characters' thoughts are formatted the way they are.  They seem very stream of conscious and to speak in non-sequitur (for example Eleanor says something along the lines of ""yes I play bridge"" to the others and then right after thinks ""I've got a cat named Dancer and I enjoy apple pie with sour cream"").

It reminds of how children talk, and I'm wondering if that is the intent, like is Hill House reverting its guests into a childlike whimsical state?  I like the book so far and it has a pretty good amount of suspense just by the descriptions of the house and its backstory, but the way the characters' think and the way they speak to each other is a bit distracting.  Anyone have any thoughts or insight?  This is the first Shirley Jackson I read, so is this just her style of writing?

A memoir written from father to son trying to prepare him for life in America while inhabiting a black body.

He uses these myths to reconcile his own personal experiences and to try and make sense of some of the infamous and senseless killings of innocent black people.

"This is my first post on this subreddit so I'm not entierly sure what to say. 

All I know that since the quarantine I've started to read again. I find joy in reading but I don't really spend as much time with it as I should. But a week ago I threw the idea of not spending enough time with reading and ordered this book.

I'm not a positive person so I was affraid that this book would bring me to a mental state I've been in some years ago. Then I thought I should get more mature and care about my own feelings and grow as a person.

Regardless I started this book it's 175 pages short so it wasn't a bunch of effort.

If you're not familiar with this book. I'll give a brief explanation. As the title says it's about a person who've lost everything time to time in his life and feels 'no longer human'. However it is a depressing story, but when I read it I didn't feel depressed or sad during it. It's more like hearing from your parents experience in life how they messed up big time and then how much pain it caused them. You feel sorry but you gain knowledge from their experience.

 As the wikipedia suggests to call it it's a semi-biography so in basic human language it has elements which were drawn out from the writers own life.

I won't get into spoilers because I want everyone who has some sort of interest in this story to read it themselves.

I'm glad that I started reading again and I hope that I'll read much more during the daily basis than before.",books,1470

The book I am currently using has 52 pages (cover, copyright, table of contents, cases, abbreviations, preface, ect) before Chapter 1.

"Hi, I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit for it, if not let me know what fits better. 

So, I love reading books. I always have and probably always will. But sometimes, I have times I don't read much, because I don't like to or I don't have the time. - years ago, lets say between 2013-2015 I didn't read much. But I bought many books. 2016 I decided that I miss reading and began to read again. I wrote down my unread books, I had over 100. to motivate myself, I even wrote down my read books. It helped a lot. But I bought new books too. So the list of unread books only got down slowly. I want to count them next time. Anyways, I wonder if someone has tips for 2 things:

1) some books of that unread list are on it for years now and I wonder if I can gain back the motivation to read them that I had when I bought them? 

2) to figure out easily which books I probably will not like. Like mostly I buy a book and I'm happy with it, but sometimes.. its cover looked better than it is. If someone has tips on how to avoid a fail, I'd be happy - also because I want to go through my unread books and sort some of them out, without wasting too much time on it but also without regretting that I decided to give it away. 

Of course there is probably no 100% guide to not regret other than to read it, but I'm dreaming about having no or just a few (like under 10) unread books haha.",books,1389
"I'm 22f, and I love to read. All the books that I'm drawn to are YA novels, and I can't help but wonder if I'm supposed to be growing out of that at my age. I usually hate the ""aren't you too old for that?"" question, but I guess the title ""Young Adult"" throws me off.  I've tried branching out and borrowing other books from my public library, though I've only ever finished one that was out of my comfort zone. I actually read YOU by Caroline Kepnes which I wouldn't say I either enjoyed or disliked it. It was interesting, and I liked having something different, but the dark story took me like 6 days to read (which is a long time for a book that size for me) because I couldn't read it in large quantities or at night. Other books that I've tried didn't keep my attention and I never finished. I don't know if it is because I just haven't found the right one or if I'm just permanently stuck in the YA genre. Should I be straying away from YA? Or is this absolutely absurd to think?",books,986
"A couple weeks ago I made a post about my frustrations with this book. I was halfway through Benjy‚Äôs part and I was very frustrated with the writing style. I decided to stick it out and I‚Äôm truly glad I did. 

First of all I‚Äôm not really sure what Faulkner wants the reader to take away from this book, but I‚Äôll offer what I got out of it. Each of the 4 parts offered such a different feeling, and emotional connection to the characters that I was really surprised by. Despite my frustrations reading the first part, I grew very fond of Benjy and got very wrapped up in his mind. I felt horrible for how he was treated and I felt the pain and struggle he went through with no one being able to understand him. This part included so many characters and different points in time, but they all painted a picture for later parts of the novel, which I can now appreciate. 

I loved reading part 2 which was Quentins chapter. Seeing this wonderful, amazing, successful person calmly plan out his suicide while his mind pulled him in so many directions was enthralling. The beginning of the chapter hints at something happening with Caddy, and the rest of the way you‚Äôre just building up suspense wondering if this could have led him to his death. 

Part 3 took such a different tone with Jason and for me, painted a picture of a completely different approach to life that im not familiar with or accustomed to in this day and age. I also really enjoyed learning about Quentin, and trying to piece together why Caddy had been shunned by her family. 

Dilseys part was also enjoyable to me. The ending kind of left me empty until I read up on its meaning and I thought it was a perfect fit to go along with the rest of the story. 

This book is unlike other fictional books I usually read. I usually love specific plots and endings, but this was the total opposite. For some reason I just adored this book along the way and couldn‚Äôt put it down. I‚Äôm really curious as to what others took away from this book, because I think other perspectives will be very different from my own",books,2070
"So I just started reading again after a long time to convincing myself to start doing it again and the book that I decided to start reading again was the Harry Potter books because they are old favourites of mine when I was young.

And now it just dawned on me - not only I do not have enough nostalgic memory for young adult novels, both books and even other forms of media that were inspired by the books (movies, games, comics and so on) but I feel that not many young adult books get enough attention in the mainstream  or even become huge hits, financially or commercially. 

&amp;#x200B;

I do not remember the last time somebody talked about the Percy Jackson books or the Hunger Games or any of the other young adult novels that I heard about from time to time.

Is it because of how much people complain that young adult novels follow the same tropes every time with little originality or a sense of distinctive ""magic"" such as the protagonist being special or chosen for unique purposes, a post-apocolyptic world or a hidden world, or a romantic trope or an adventure story where it is predictable or characters who lack distinctiveness?

Or is it because there is so much of them that it is difficult to remember them all?

Or maybe is it because there is some luck involved?",books,1286

I'm at 20% now and when he mentions his other books along with runnings I realize I don't know him actually neither his writing style.

"I followed up reading the book with a look at the highly regarded 8-part TV series, and it was like comparing a cathedral to a shoe box.  Scenes with overwhelming emotional impact in the book (such as the death of Agnes) were rushed and flat.  Tension and expectation threading through the pages were entirely lost in translation.  I think the main difference is that a novel shows you want a scene really feels like from the inside by giving access to the characters thoughts and perceptions.  Short of a voiceover which is almost always annoying and intrusive, the screen just can't do it - and that robs scenes of their emotional kick.  Next is the ability to calibrate tension with the pace of the writing.  A book can extend a single moment as long as it likes (say by describing what different characters are experiencing or the details of the scene) but the screen is stuck with the same speed, short of putting something in slow motion but that can't work for long, if at all.  A book can also be far more graphic and detailed as well as using all the senses, not just vision and hearing.  There are probably lots more examples but I'd never been struck with the difference so clearly that comparing these two versions.",books,1227
"For me, it was probably Tuesdays with Morrie. I'm a bit emotional about this one, cause it reminds me of my grandfather who passed away when I was young. 

&amp;#x200B;

And if you‚Äôre trying to show off to people at the bottom, forget it. They will only envy you. The status will get you nowhere. Only an open heart will allow you to float equally between everyone""

&amp;#x200B;

Tuesdays with Morrie has honestly influenced me to be a person who is less obsessed with status and fame. I'm still pretty young but growing up I always had this fixation on being famous. I know the downsides of it but there was always this part of me who wanted to be admired and well known just for validation. Your accomplishments will be magnified, your reputation will precede you and no one will afford to insult you. But reading this book humbled me down by a lot. It really shifted my attitude towards fame and what I should be prioritising in life. It taught me to reject popular culture values and cultivate my own instead. Instead of focusing on what people think of me and how I should please everyone, I started thinking about how much it matters to be unapologetically yourself. Instead of trying to impress someone else, focus on making yourself feel significant. Fame is just a game you can never win completely.

"After my English reach a semi-functional level a few years ago I started to read a lot of English novels and short stories. Naturally, most of them were by American and British authors.

Recently I have been trying to expand my horizon a bit and read translated works from authors of different countries. Two of the most recent books I have read are The Wind-up Bird Chronicle by the Japanese author Haruki Murakami and Boy in the Twilight by the Chinese author Yu Hua. And want to write a few lines about each.

I have been hearing a lot about Murakami here on Reddit. He seems to be a very popular Japanese author. Most people recommend Norwegian Wood, but for no particular reason I chose the Wind-up Bird Chronicle as my first Murakami book. And to be honest, if all Murakami books are like that it‚Äôll probably be the last one as well.

I rarely enjoy surrealistic novels. The plots are too illogical for me, the symbolism flies over my head, and generally they are kind of confusing to me.

The main plot of the guy trying to get his cheating wife back through a completely unclear method wasn‚Äôt at all interesting. But I enjoyed the stories about the WWII from Japanese perspective, as irrelevant to the main plot as they ended up being. I also enjoyed reading May Kasahara‚Äôs odd perspective on things. She ended up as my most favorite character in the whole novel.

All in all, the book wasn‚Äôt bad enough so I would abandon it, but it wasn‚Äôt exactly great either.

About Boy in the Twilight, the book is a collection of 13 short stories by the Chinese author Yu Hua. I know next to nothing about the day to day life inside mainland China, so decided to read this one to gain some insight.

Boy, Yu Hua‚Äôs writing is brutal. He is very honest in his writing and doesn‚Äôt try to sugar-coat things. All the while I was reading it I kept thinking to myself: ‚ÄúIs this guy trying to make people hate China?‚Äù

Despite all that, I enjoyed reading the stories and learning about how everyday people live in China and recommend it, if you have the stomach for it.",books,2058

"Personally, I don't think Santiago dies at the end as many seem to believe, and there are a few reasons why I think that:

-At first when I saw that he managed to catch the Marlin, but his vision was blurry and unclear I tought that Santiago might die at sea. I tought that even though he managed to catch the fish, all his struggle would be in vain. I was pleasantly surprised to see that that was not the case, as it would've been a pretty clich√©ic ending.

-After seeing how the sharks were quickly devouring the Marlin I realised that it was indeed all in vain, as Santiago himself says, but I was hoping that he might at least get half of it home. After the sharks eat all of the fish and Santiago says the he feels "" a coppery sweet taste"" in his mouth I tought that might mean he's dying, but he quickly adds ""he was afraid of it for a moment. But there was not much of it."" Which means that it wasn't anything serious. 

- And finally, in the last pages of the book Santiago tells the boy that he feels a pain in his chest and that he spat something during the night. I personally tought this could mean that either his ribs were broken or that his lungs were punctured, but if that were the case, then I don't think he would've manged to
A. Sail back to the port and 
B. To climb the rocks with the mast on his shoulders **and** make it all the way back to his cabin.

I don't know, maybe I'm just being optimistic,  hoping that the Old Man survives after all he's been through, but I can't help but feel that him dying would be too simple/clich√©ic and not in tune with the rest of the book.",books,1600

These are some examples from my favourite and probably the greatest book ever, 11/22/69

I also love how his stories are all so different and his style so versatile. He has such a hugely wide range of vocabulary that he can use all of the words in the dictionary. His characters are always such diverse and unique characters like the alcoholic writer in The Shining to the stuttering and anxious Bill Denbrough and again to the forcefully captured Paul Sheldon. His stories can be set in a real place like New England and Derry or they can be set somewhere fictional like Castle Rock or Maine. He can have dialogue from both rural people and city folk, **in the same story**.

He has also a great sense of humour. Like when he said that he has outlived a lot of his critics, as they are all dead. He is also one of the most prolific writers ever and also, obviously, one of the richest. He also has allowed a lot of his books to be made into movies, so people who don't have the time to read tomes of 800 pages can still enjoy his genius. He is probably the greatest writer ever. Definitely the greatest novelist as Shakspear was a playist. Anyways, he has also written the best book on writing, cleverly titled ""On Writing"". Seriously, read it even if you don't want to be a writer. It has so much to say about life and art that no other book does. 

He has also said that he doesn't plan out or even know how his stories are going to go. He just writes stuff and it works. I think that is the best way to write as you don't get bogged down in the technicalities of grammar and punctuation or if your writing is going to hurt the feelings of any SJWs. Anyways, the fog of unreality of King's writing is probably why it is so admired. When the writer himself doesn't know what's going to happen then it's even harder for the reader to guess where it will go. Thus, some divine thing probably guides Mr. King. What a perfect name, btw, for the King of writers. Lol.

"For me, it got better and better as it went along. The first scene that really hooked me though, was when they are basically communicating through a Ouija Board. That‚Äôs when I started thinking that maybe there‚Äôs more to this paraphysics stuff. 

After this the book got really weird. 

The Overmind has to be intelligent to communicate with the overlords, but the Overmind isn‚Äôt a single race. It absorbs other races, but it had to have begun with one race, so what is this original race like. 

Also, the Overmind recognizes when a race is about to evolve. The Overlords say that if humans had actually begin to study paraphysics, it would be a problem for the Overmind. I was curious how this would actually affect them though?

Overall, I really liked the book. I thought the portrayal of a Utopia was very well done. I don‚Äôt believe that humanity would completely stagnate and the idea of New Athens seemed very realistic. I also liked the imagery within the books, as the scenes were very vivid. The characters were also well developed. I liked how Karellen started off as this mysterious all-powerful figure, but in the end he is just as helpless against the Overmind as humans were to the Overlords If not more. The thing about Jan I really thought was well done was that even though he was on board their ship and planet for less than a year, he had aged what seemed like 80. He has experienced a lifetime worth of things, and his dialogue and character at the end reflected that. 

I would definitely recommend this book!",books,1530

I originally did not want to use ebooks because I like the 'authenticity' of real books (whatever that means) but it's so convenient and useful and I can just take out my phone in public or if I'm eating and don't want to get anything on my book and just read.

"&gt;!I know Coriolanus Snow is supposed to be a bad guy because if he wasn't all the other books wouldn't make much sense without another book to explain the continuation of the Hunger Games in the Capitol along with many other things. I just feel like Collins just forgot at the end that he was supposed to be bad. The rest of the book was absolutely amazing don't get me wrong but when he decided to start firing the rifle into the forest with the intention of killing Lucy Gray, it felt so sudden and unlike how he was throughout the other parts of the book. Maybe Collins could have made it seem that the peacekeeping had changed him somehow. I don't know because either way he becomes the bad guy so it would be hard in my opinion to have a satisfying ending. It kind of reminds me of Inception, my favorite movie, when at the end, I feel it could have been made so much better if the top had just completely fallen over not just tremor. Like in The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, the ending if just altered a small bit could have been so much better. I wish that maybe Coriolanus had sneaked Lucy Gray into the Capitol and did all the things that he does later because he was maybe forced or blackmailed to do it to keep her safe. I don't know. It was a great book, absolutely stellar I just had a couple problems with the ending.!&lt;

"So there is a book I remember very fondly from elementary school, and I would very much like to reread it, but I have only the vaguest sense of what it was about. Hopefully you big brains can help sort me out.

From what I recall the book was about a space princess and her guardian knight fleeing an evil empire of insects. They have some sort of plane-hopping/dimension-shifting ability, or travel through gates to different worlds. At the start of the story the princess and knight are hiding on a classic medieval style world where they meet the fantasy bumpkin main character.

Over the course of the book they travel to different worlds with crazy sci-fi tech and the bumpkin gradually becomes a knight.

Some random details I remember:
*They have mushroom houses on the fantasy world.
*They use technology to speak with the dead at one point.
*The knights have some crazy chainmail that links with their brain and let's them move super fast. In fact, a lot of the technology was related to some sort of mind linking mechanism, that came in different qualities and looked like a fantasy headdress.
*The protagonists do some shady stuff, like killing and robbing a bug civilian when they first get out of the fantasy world.
*There's some sort of time loop at the end where a cool guy the bumpkin saw at the beginning of the story turns out to have been the fully decked out bumpkin from the future.
*The knights have some sort of argument about the princess and have a sweet sci-fi fight.
*I think it was in the middle of a series, but I never read the rest.
*It is quite possible that the book was actually really bad, but I'd still like till find it!

"I used to be non reader. Until I ended up going to a book fair once with a friend and I spotted the book The Better Angels of Our Nature by Steven Pinker. That's a 900+ pages book, way beyond the biggest book I've read until that point, but I was just too curious and captivated by the thesis of the author that I had to buy it and read it. Since then, I've been an avid reader of science or so called nonfiction books. 
I've tried getting into fiction, but I rarely get that engage with it. I've tried classics, fantasy, scifi, you name it, and most of the time I don't enjoy it as much as let's say history book.

"Except for school books, manuals and other informative texts, I have never read books and I have never been interested in them. I have always been a movie guy. That has changed lately, LOTR is my absolute favorite movie. I recently watched the Harry Potter movies for the first time, and although I enjoyed the movies, I felt like there was much more to the story than what the movie shows. So I thought maybe there is more to LOTR than what the movie shows. 

I made up my mind and decided I will first read the Hobbit and then move on to LOTR. I read a couple pages of the Hobbit, and to my surprise, I actually enjoyed it. But I feel my brain is programmed to read informative texts. And since there isn't any real ""information"" in story books, my brain skips everything I'm reading. It's hard for me to explain, but It's like I am reading a paragraph, and we are introduced to some characters, there can be a conversation, or some minor details like the name of an inn, and as soon as I am on the next page, I forget the names, the conversation, and the name of the inn. If the conversation is about something important, I do pick it up, but I am unable to repeat the exact words of the conversation, I just pick up the summary. Sometimes while I read, my mind just wanders around and I think about all kinds of other things, and I end up forgetting the entire page I just read. This doesn't happen when I read informative texts, or when I watch movies. You might think I am brain damaged or something, but for instance, when I watch movies, I am able to recreate an entire scene in my mind. But ask me to repeat what I just read, and I am unable to. I can  give you a summary, but I am nowhere able to repeat the exact words.

"Heard it was amazing but I came away disappointed. I thought it had a promising start, up until around the time Kolya arrives, randomly forced into the story to provide banter and journey with Lev. The ending was cliche, pretty much the same story as The Alchemist.

I think it was the dialogue that got me the most. Maybe it's because Benioff is a TV writer but it felt unrealistic, overly jovial and theatrical. Kind of like reading Harry Potter or similar young adult fiction transplanted into a Warzone. All these two guys seem to talk about is sex, increasingly beyond the first half of the book. I get that they're young men, but they're in WW2 and surrounded by death and cannibals and all they can think about is bedding any woman they encounter.

I might've gone into it at the wrong angle, expecting a realistic tale given it's set in WW2, but I think even if I was after some basic TV-like entertainment I still would've found it mediocre.",books,950

2. Searching somewhat randomly on Goodreads and Libby. With Libby I will pick a subject and use the randomized sort option. I found an interesting history of my neighborhood this way.

I can't remember offhand whether there are any other books in the series that jump around in the timeline.  Any other fans recall the correct order?  


I'm interested in other people's opinions of Improbable, later books in the series, everything that Jody Lynn Nye wrote after the original author passed away in 2008, and a lot of the themes that I'll admit I didn't manage to catch completely the first time I read the series.  Curious to see if anyone has read and wants to share their feelings on Myth-Quoted, which I missed hearing about when it came out in 2013 and just discovered in the last week so I feel like I should hand over my fanboy card for that offense.

"Before I say anything else, I just want to say that I highly recommend reading these books, and The Hobbit too because they are really well written.

The first that I had ever heard of the series was watching the movies as a kid, and as I've grown up I've developed a love for fantasy. For books throughout the years I've read the Last Dragon Chronicles, Fablehaven, and the Inheritance Cycle. I play d&amp;d, Skyrim, watched Game of Thrones, and paint fantasy miniatures as well. It was on my list for a while to read Tolkien's books, the ones that really helped to grow the fantasy genre to what it is today. 

I think that I've only watched the films twice, with the most recent being summer of 2018; and it was likely around that time that I spied the trilogy in a local used bookstore and decided to buy them. I had previously owned The Hobbit, and so I began to read that book once I was finished with the Inheritance Cycle. Once I finished reading that one, I had started reading Fellowship of the Ring but found myself procrastinating reading it. That may have been partially because of school draining my energy to read and partially because of me choosing not to. For about a year the book sat at around 50 pages in, on the first event and exposition describing the Shire and its folk.

That is until this summer, when I made the choice to pick it up again. On those first couple days I had read 100 pages each day. I was quite surprised that I was really enjoying it after letting it collect dust for so long, and so I read about 20+ pages every subsequent day (maybe skipped a day but you get the point). Before I knew it I was on the Two Towers and was invested in the story, and it wasn't long before I finished Return of the King either. Now that I've finished I do have a couple thoughts about the books:

1)Tolkien writes many songs and poems into his work, which was very interesting to learn a little bit more about the world through characters expressing themselves. These were also in italics and were a nice break to read the more spaced out songs rather than the regular paragraphs of books. It also gave each character a more unique voice and cultural background, and some of them were written by Tolkien in elvish.

2) It was very interesting to see what changes Peter Jackson made and which characters just don't exist at all in the movies. I will admit though that because I had seen the movies before reading the novels, I did see the characters as the actors in those films. After reading I do feel the urge to watch the movies again just for the experience.

3) Kind of like in real life, certain small events and actions of individual characters led to others which resulted in a big change. I think this quote from the book really sums this point up. *'Even the smallest person can change the course of the future'*

4) I found myself a little less interested at times when yet another hilly landscape was being described and way more interested in reading when dialogue was involved between the characters, going so far as to imagine their voices and intonation.

5) After seeing all that the characters went through and reading through 3 large books, you do feel like you've been on the journey with them, and it's certainly an experience that I would recommend.",books,3296
"I just ordered *Women and Men* from Dzanc Books and am excited to knuckle down and plow through that one, but in the meantime I'm reading *Plus*, which is proving to be difficult (as expected) but deeply interesting.

Are his other books also good? *Lookout Cartridge* seems very cool but certainly quite a bit denser and longer than *Plus*.

"Hi,

Over a few weeks I've been following this novel or more like a story Who are you, my husband? It seemed interesting at first but the problem is I can't seem to get a hold of a legit place to read it and it's the first time. Like there's just one website who posts a chapter a day and even he's version is a lot different and the grammer's shit. Can anyone point towards where I can follow up on this? I know it's a Chinese novel about Chase Lu who abandons his family and becomes a security guard but has to get back his fortunes once his daughter becomes sick.

"A while ago, I picked up from a second-hand shop a volume of 'Riddle of the Seven Realms' by Lyndon Hardy. It looked like a fairly standard magic/adventure flick, nothing serious. However...

The description. Those incredible, immersive worlds, in particular the sheer scale &gt;!of the world of the demons.!&lt; The little details, sometimes horrifying, sometimes hilarious, that brought the worlds alive. The different mechanics of different places, &gt;!essentially equivallent to different laws of physics (mostly in the first part of the book).!&lt;

But...

Damn, the bad parts are pretty bad. The worldbuilding, its greatest strength in my opinion, grew convoluted and rushed towards the end. It gave the impression of trying to hurry for a deadline. That's forgivable. But...The female characters. I can't figure out how someone could write them un-ironically (and if they were written ironically, I didn't find it funny). I didn't always like the two main male characters, but at least they got personalities, goals, some level of character development. &gt;!Whereas the two main female characters were pretty much walking stereotypes: the wizard whose struggle is that she isn't taken seriously by her male counterparts, so she proceeds to do absolutely nothing for the rest of the book apart from getting infatuated with the worst possible love interest, and the fey queen who is selfish and mercenary in nature (which I actually have nothing against, except that her actions are always described as self-sacrificing despite explicit proof to the contrary?).!&lt;

It's strange. If I was to add its strengths and flaws together, I'd probably end up with 'somewhat above average', but...Something average would be forgettable. This is not. And perhaps...I'm thinking, if it had only the strengths or only the weaknesses, it wouldn't be quite as memorable either. There is something about the combination that unsettles the mind. In terms of other media, I guess I've had a similar reaction to Repo the Genetic Opera.

What about you? Are there books that you would describe as 'very good...but also really bad' and which stick in your mind for this precise reason?

"What a book! David Foster Wallace included this book in his 5 most underappreciated U.S novels since the 1960s and boy I can see why.

If anybody can write about the human soul with clarity and honesty its Denis Johnson.

The book is about a single mother and an ex con who meet on a bus ride and its about 2 people down an out told with a gritty dirty realism.

A passage: *It was alright to be who he was, but others would probably think it was terrible. A couple of times in the past he'd reached absolute zero of the truth, and without fear or bitterness he realized now that somewhere inside it there was a move he could make to change his life, to become another person, but he'd never be able to guess what it was.*

"Coming off one of the best books I've ever read, World War Z, Max Brooks' new book Devolution (June 16th, 2020) really missed the mark for me.

There is a Sasquatch massacre, and Sasquatch is big. This is not a spoiler, this is the cover of the book, and most of the content.

The story lays out what will happen, then it happens. The book is written largely from the perspective of person writing a journal. It's a played out perspective, and what in part made The Silent Patient unbelievable to me. In times of crisis, people don't write sprawling pages of journal. It's partially addressed in the book, but not to my satisfaction.

The book wasn't even fun, the characters are not unique and barely memorable. When main characters die (again not a spoiler, it's on the cover), I felt nothing for them. The book does not bring any of the nuances of survival that World War Z had.

"My rating:

1. Norwegian Wood - 10/10
2. Kafka On The Shore - 9/10
3. Sputnik Sweetheart - 8.5/10
4. What I Talk About When I Talk About Running - 8.5/10
5. Wind-up Bird Chronicle - 8/10 
6. Dance Dance Dance - 7.5/10
7. Hear The Wind Sing - 7/10
8. The Strange Library - 6/10
9. Pinball 1973 - 6/10
10. Men Without Women - 6/10

My first book was his autobiography What I Talk About When I Talk About Running. I read this book because I love long-distance running and I read about it in an article. 

Then I read Sputnik Sweetheart and I can't really describe how I felt after reading it. Before this, I knew about Murakami but I had not read any reviews or synopsis of his works. I didn't know what I was getting into and I didn't have many expectations. The experience of reading was very unique, something I never felt during reading. 

Next, I read Kafka on the shore and I was awestruck. After reading Sputnik Sweetheart I was prepared for anything Murakami had to offer. Now, the book was weird, I mean there is a man who could talk to cats, fishes and leeches raining through the sky and for no reason, there is KFC's founder Colonel Sanders Sanders and Jack Daniels and somehow everything is related to one another. It's frustrating, confusing yet transformative. His seamless process of using poetic prose intertwined with dramatic and philosophical moments makes you fall in love with the plot. 

After reading Kafka on the Shore I got addicted. I know it sounds absurd but I wanted to read more and then I picked up Norwegian Wood. Now this book does not have a whole lot of plot but the narration is on point and makes you fall in love with every character. The plot isn't fast enough but there is a feeling of progress when it comes to knowing his character. This book became my instant favourite.

Then I read his other books and I enjoyed them all. They weren't as good as the previous ones but I loved the reading experience of each one. All his book kind of feels similar but its like ice-cream, you know it would taste the same but you eat it anyway for the experience. 

I am not sure if I would recommend Murakami to anyone because I honestly don't know if the other person will actually like it. Many of his books have open endings and for some people, it may be frustrating. Murakami's books are about experience, not caring about the destination and enjoying the journey instead.",books,2403

God  gives us trials, or maybe not God, depends on what we trust in. And     when We think that we know what awaits us Tomorrow, it turns out that   we   are cruelly mistaken.

And   the World changes around you, as if everything is somewhere   beyond the   line, and you are here alone + your family, but you are all   the same   alone and only disease is with you.

And  then I told myself that if I survive, then I will not do business I    had  before, I will fulfill my dream ‚Äì writing for children (and their     parents). Maybe it was too late to begin?

"*""I now know, by an almost fatalistic conformity with the facts, that my destiny is to travel.""*

I don't know quite what to make of this one. This book piqued my interest because I was interested in reading about the origin stories of the revolutionary leader who helped topple the Cuban government. The pitch is that a young Che rides a motorcycle around Latin America, witnesses poverty, and then dedicates his life to a Marxist cause that is now engraved in history. I expected a philosophical journey filled with insight, and thoughts about the human condition. But this was not the case.

When you read about historical figures who helped shape the political landscapes of the societies we see today it's difficult to imagine that these people were not born great. The most compelling part about the Motorcycle Diaries is the way it dispels this assumption in a way that feels organic and sincere. Most of this book is the story of Che and his traveling companion traveling through the continent, getting drunk, freeloading off of people, and trying to stay out of trouble. Some parts are a bit dry, others are quite comedic, but it's the honesty in which these stories are told that serves at the heart of these pages. Because he wasn't always an influential political figure, or a leader of nations. At one point he was just a punk kid trying to navigate his way through the world, and it's in this unbrittled youth that we are given the opportunity to see a reflection of ourselves.",books,1491

" 

We read nonfiction to learn more about the world around us. The world is fascinating, and amazing, but it is also  weird, and often times, gruesome. *Stiff: the Curious Lives of Human Cadavers* provides a view into the world of the dead. Unless you are working in the death industry, or as a medical professional of some kind, most us have the pleasure of never having to see or think about dead bodies. 

Mary Roach's 2003 novel is a fascinating read into the extremely weird world of the dead. She takes on a scientific perspective, mostly discussing the uses of cadavers. But she does so in first -person. I found her perspective to be humorous and lighthearted, or as much as you can be when discussing the dead.  The most interesting thing I learned from this book is how many uses and needs there are for cadavers. Ballistic research, car crash research, medical schools, organ transplants, and then some even more weird circumstances like head transplants, and museum collections. There are even some chapters on the history of using cadavers for medical purposes. It's funny to hear about the early autopsies, and medicinal uses of...umm..bodily fluids and what not. The point is..We never would have a full understanding of human anatomy if it were not for the early cadavers and wacky folk who experimented on and with them.

One of my favorite things about this book is the interviews with people who handle the cadavers, or *pieces* of cadavers. The people who handle them do so with care and dignity--often times remembering that it is a precious opportunity that has been given by the living. Through all the disgusting, and odd parts of the book--it is also extremely human. Mary discusses who these cadavers are also people. They had interests, careers, families, pet peeves, and so on. It's so important to remember that throughout the reading of this book. 

We hate facing death--the death industry has also been a huge part of the removal, but that's a discussion for another time. What this book helps to accomplish is to show the natural state of the deceased. In a way, you're not truly done after you die. Hence the name: *Lives of Human Cadavers*. It might just be the act of decomposition, but your body will still change states or even locations. It's morbid and horrifying to think about, but also fascinating, and in a way mesmerizing.",books,2367

"First of all, I am... very, very, very caught in the feelings of both shock and awe at the fluid writing and imaginative storytelling of this book. It unfolded to me like a movie, it was that wonderful, amazing, horrifying. 


What? What? WHAT? 

Ok, now I am going to cut to the chase:

The ending. The ending which I think was open-ended. Sure, Theo was under suspicion by Officer Allen, and Theo's probably not-all-there in the final scene... yet it was his word ( a seemingly empathic and amorous psychotherapist who was lauded for his efforts by his colleagues.) against Alicia's word (a very unfortunate and tragic TRAGIC patient in the psych ward.) 

So I think it the ending doesn't necessarily say that Theo was going to be apprehended, nor did it say that Theo wasn't which greatly disturbs me in such a way that I have never been disturbed by a book before dammit. üòÖ

What a great modern tragedy though! It's nothing like I've ever read before so you can probably imagine me embodying that surprised Pikachu meme as I furiously read the pages.

Anyways, what do you think? Was the ending open-ended or did it implicitly say that justice was had for Alicia?",books,1167

I've read the book multiple times, and I've come up with two potential explanations about such comments. 

**1.**The first thought that comes to mind is that people have a hard time dealing with reality. Most of the time, they will sugar coat an unpleasant behavior or event, filling themselves with lies. Every time they read 48 laws of power, some of the pilled up lies trigger them, and they get defensive and angry.

"Yesterday, after Netflix released the trailer of Charlie Kaufman's upcoming film adaptation (coming out on 4th of September), I thought I'd give this book a shot. 

I know this book has been fairly divisive, but I could not put it down and managed to finish it in one sitting. My god. I can't remember the last time I was so hypnotized and down-right psychologically freaked out by book. I'm pretty thick skinned when it comes to horror, but I really had trouble sleeping after this and had some pretty chilling dreams. 

It looks like Kaufman's adaptation is gonna take some pretty big liberties from the book (Jesse Plemons, who's paying Jake, has said that he's kept ""less than 15%"" of the dialogue from the book), and I'm interested to see how it'll pan out (i'm a huge Kaufman fan-boy). 

Has anyone else read this book? If so, what did you think? Also, how are people feeling about the film?",books,897
"I was thinking about buying some books from them. They're books that I wouldn't be able to get pretty much anywhere else. I read that the condition was sometimes worse than advertised, the shipping took longer than expected, and customer service didn't help. I might buy from them anyway though, because I don't really care about condition and how long shopping takes that much, I just want those books. 
Has anyone bought from them? Any advice?",books,445

"My rating:

1. Norwegian Wood - 10/10
2. Kafka On The Shore - 9/10
3. Sputnik Sweetheart - 8.5/10
4. What I Talk About When I Talk About Running - 8.5/10
5. Wind-up Bird Chronicle - 8/10 
6. Dance Dance Dance - 7.5/10
7. Hear The Wind Sing - 7/10
8. The Strange Library - 6/10
9. Pinball 1973 - 6/10
10. Men Without Women - 6/10

My first book was his autobiography What I Talk About When I Talk About Running. I read this book because I love long-distance running and I read about it in an article. 

Then I read Sputnik Sweetheart and I can't really describe how I felt after reading it. Before this, I knew about Murakami but I had not read any reviews or synopsis of his works. I didn't know what I was getting into and I didn't have many expectations. The experience of reading was very unique, something I never felt during reading. 

Next, I read Kafka on the shore and I was awestruck. After reading Sputnik Sweetheart I was prepared for anything Murakami had to offer. Now, the book was weird, I mean there is a man who could talk to cats, fishes and leeches raining through the sky and for no reason, there is KFC's founder Colonel Sanders Sanders and Jack Daniels and somehow everything is related to one another. It's frustrating, confusing yet transformative. His seamless process of using poetic prose intertwined with dramatic and philosophical moments makes you fall in love with the plot. 

After reading Kafka on the Shore I got addicted. I know it sounds absurd but I wanted to read more and then I picked up Norwegian Wood. Now this book does not have a whole lot of plot but the narration is on point and makes you fall in love with every character. The plot isn't fast enough but there is a feeling of progress when it comes to knowing his character. This book became my instant favourite.

Then I read his other books and I enjoyed them all. They weren't as good as the previous ones but I loved the reading experience of each one. All his book kind of feels similar but its like ice-cream, you know it would taste the same but you eat it anyway for the experience. 

I am not sure if I would recommend Murakami to anyone because I honestly don't know if the other person will actually like it. Many of his books have open endings and for some people, it may be frustrating. Murakami's books are about experience, not caring about the destination and enjoying the journey instead.",books,2403
"This is a weird kind of issue with me that I'm not exactly sure how to describe, but I'll try my best anyways. A lot of the time after I watch/read/play/etc. something, I'll want more of that exact feel. This is especially true for books. For a completely random example, if I read a story about a ghost on the run from the police in a dark fantasy setting, I'll want a story that gives me the same exact feeling/atmosphere. I know it's not unusual to want to read a similar kind of book after watching or reading something, but for me, it's always super specific and has to match exactly, and makes it much more hard to find a book that I'll be satisfied with.

Do any of you guys have this same kind of feeling, and how do you usually handle it? Love to hear different thoughts on this.

He went on and graduated with a 4.5 GPA in High School and is graduating from a top university. I have been taking notes and I do not want my parents to think I am dumb. Is it true, that taking notes is for lower intelligence?

"I‚Äôve just finished the book this afternoon after a three day binge read, and I‚Äôm mentally exhausted. Throughout the story I‚Äôve been searching for a meaning that was staring me in the face the entire time, but I never wanted to accept it. I didn‚Äôt want to believe that the book was about the slow death of a child.

I was sure that Ender would lose a big game and then redeem himself as a human, a child, and a tactical genius, but it never happened. Ender won every single game he played, enduring the torture until the very end where his last thread of humanity was severed. 

I‚Äôm dumbfounded; I feel such legitimate sorrow for the character. All throughout the story, Ender knows that he‚Äôs a pawn in a bigger game but can do nothing else besides play along. He knows that he‚Äôs a god among his peers, but is bound so tightly by the I.F. that he feels powerless all the same. He‚Äôs a boy who is ripped away from childhood and treated like an animal, abused and used for his brain. Ender wins every game he plays, and his prize is endless suffering.

"Unlike the different portrayals of Sherlock Holmes(plays + TV Shows + Movies), the book depicts something very - very different. In the book, Holmes isn't some irritating sociopath who has ZERO feelings. He doesn't undermine other people because they are lesser than him. But he is something very similar to all of us : He too is Ordinary!

Yes he has these amazing observational skills but that never intervenes with this conduct towards other people. He is very humble towards everyone, never ignores anyone, always makes it a point to at least hear the other person, never undermines the other person cause he / she lacks something.

And it doesn't just end there, the story line is completely different and the character arc is totally off to. In the books, the story revolves around the life of the characters, not just S.H. it shows how everyone at the end of the day is HUMAN and how it is not the guy but the circumstances that depict a crime.

Even the entry and exit of Sherlock's arc nemesis ""Moriarty"" is completely different too. In the books the character is introduced with such delicacy and continuity that you grow to understand Sherlock more as you are introduced to the character of Moriarty.

"Hey everyone I just finished Pachinko and I wanted to know what everyone thought after reading it? Personally, I found the book interesting and insightful to the problems Koreans face in Japan &amp; in their own homeland. I came across this book after searching for books similar to *A thousand splendid suns* and I can see why it was recommended. It is definitely different to all the books I have read in the past, but it was definitely a weak book as I've outlined in the reasons below. 

I think the purpose and impact of the story writing itself was not very effective. So many things happened during the book but it felt like I was never really able to connect with any of the characters besides Sunja. As to why - that's very difficult to put into words. A lot of STUFF happened however there was little in terms of character reflection &amp; reaction to the things that happened, and exactly how it made them feel. I struggled to understand how previous events of the novel had caused them to change/not change into better people. 

There was not much character development either and aspects of the writing made them not *feel human* if that makes any sense? The book was not very cohernt - it felt like I was always waiting for something important to happen. The dialogue too often had so little meaning and the descriptive writing was good, however I don't see how it made the overall piece more emotive and impactful. Overall, it kind of just felt like reading a history book mixed with a bad novel!

"Not sure where to begin, or what of the following has already been mentioned/discussed in this sub. But, I just finished Dune, and it **really** invigorated my week. 

Firstly, I'm perhaps more of a movie person than a book person, so I endeavored to read this book in anticipation for the film's release this December. I'm largely nescient when it comes to fantasy or sci-fi writing. (I think(?) people usually categorize Dune as science fiction, but I would argue Herbert adroitly combines the two genres -- but I'll get back to that). It can sometimes be difficult to will myself to read either of these genres, so I was reticent to start.  

And in that vein, this 800\~ page (my version) tome overwhelmed me slightly. I've read long books, but they usually take me months. Gravity's Rainbow, Infinite Jest, et cetera. They're fun feats to accomplish, but they're just that - feats, monumental efforts that take a better part of year and not without frustration and outside resources guiding my journey. 

I read Dune in 3 days. This is the first book in the **longest** time I just couldn't put down. Yes, it took me a little while to fully engross myself in the Arrakeen narrative, but once I hit a certain point, I was hooked! I couldn't really sleep Tuesday night, so what did I end up doing? I finished Dune at 4 in the morning. 

The way Herbert combines ecology with religion with technology with politics...It felt like such a unique reading experience. And that's where I think this book is equal parts science fiction and fantasy: The governmental aspects of planetary polities as limited by imperial control, influenced by a mining guild and a mystical school of witches? Whew. And maybe other sci-fi authors have included politics into their works in a similar manner, but this is all new to me. The worldbuilding is just so incredible.

"I am so very tired of books about WWII. It seems like 50% of fiction is WWII historical fiction. When I go into libby and choose a book at random, it is almost always a WWII book. I figured this is just selection bias, I'm really unlucky, and it is just in my head. NO! Today I got a surprise grab bag from the library and 2 out of 5 of the books were about WWII. Last time I got a random grab bags it was 6/10. 

Tbh, I find it lazy. It's like raping the damsel to motivate the hero. I get it establishes a time, a context, a villain(s), and provides drama to motivate the plot but its at this point its a crutch. Instead of   
inventing their own villains, their own scenarios, OR JUST PICKING A DIFFERENT WAR, they use it as nothing more than a trope. Very few of these books are interesting, innovating, or even adding different perspectives. Lots of people enjoy reading the same story over and over again and I get the appeal. But I don't have to wade through 5 million Nicholas Sparks or Twilight ripoffs to read Cloud Atlas. So I advocate for creating the WWII historical fiction subgenre so junkies may all be allowed easier access to their war porn (and I can then filter it out).

Every casting decisions is wrong. Every change in the story or shift in character is wrong. Something from the book was cut? HOW DARE THEY DEFILE SUCH A WORK OF LITERATURE!

Bless their hearts, it's all good and I don't mean to say they shouldn't have those opinions. I just find it funny how much new readers seem to relish getting worked up about that stuff, like it's one of the most fun things about getting into reading and they haven't just learned to live and let live about adaptations.

"This is an review of the book by Gerry Wathen. I am a friend of his but was told to not factor that in this review and be honest about it when he gave me a free copy. This is not a very popular book but I actually enjoyed reading it. It starts off with these battles between an evil empire and separate kingdoms. Then it switches to a different part of the world and follows the growth of a character named Rolf along with his friends. It's basically a story about how a kingdom can rise from nothing and turn into something great. It reminded me of the movie ""Outlaw King."" Rolf discovers new allies along his journey and there is a really cool part where they enter an underground world populated by an Atlantean-like civilization. There's monsters and even the monsters within men. I recommend this if you enjoy a good adventure book that also has warfare and romance. It took me a while to get into it because I was busy but I thoroughly enjoyed it when I dedicated a few days to finishing it. I give this a 4/5 only because the dialogue can be a little hard to follow between characters even though correct grammar is used to separate dialogue. Idk, that's just me.

There's monsters and even the monsters within men. I recommend this if you enjoy a good adventure book that also has warfare and romance. It took me a while to get into it because I was busy but I thoroughly enjoyed it when I dedicated a few days to finishing it. I give this a 4/5 only because the dialogue can be a little hard to follow between characters even though correct grammar is used to separate dialogue. Idk, that's just me. One star off is all I feel good about doing. It's free for kindle unlimited but I chose to buy a paperback and really enjoyed looking at the cover every now and then.",books,1170

"Hello everyone,

Welcome to the first discussion thread for August Book Club in which we will cover Chapter 1 through 7 of The Traitor Baru Cormorant by Seth Dickinson. 

* What is your impression of Baru so far?

&gt; Remorseless not out of cruelty or hate but because it was too vast and too set on its destiny to care for the small tragedies of its growth.

* Often in Fantasy the empire the protagonist fights against conquers areas through military means. How is your perception of The Masquerade influenced by the fact that they conquer through trade and other means? Does that make them appear more or less dangerous?

* Who do you think Cairdine Farrier truly is?

* Why do you think Baru was sent to Aurdwynn? Is it a punishment?

* Where do you think the biggest danger for Baru is going to come from?

"As #28 in the Discworld series, I'm afraid this novel might get unduly overlooked. It is, however, a perfect book for our times in light of what recently happened in Portland.

A city under stress, a populace fed up with being ill-fed, repression of the masses by a disconnected ruling class, and a brewing revolution ... The novel is framed in familiar themes, and that's the whole point. The story of political struggle will always be relevant (it was published in 2002). It's the man-in-the-middle, Sam Vimes, that puts flesh on the bones of those moments whose substance are usually reduced to ether by a newspaper headline. 

Some examples:

-A secret police presence, sanctioned as a greater authority than local law enforcement, is used as a tool of fear and repression. 

-Those running the government, motivated to maintain their own authority and acting in the name of ""Law &amp; Order,"" commit violence against the civilians they are charged with protecting. 

-Conflicting loyalties set local police against federal troops. Explored is the notion of ""policeman"" as derived from ""polis"" to mean ""man of the city,"" versus troops who are outsiders and therefore more apt to see civilians as enemies of the state rather than neighbors and family.

-Deescalation versus intimidation in dealing with The People. Several times in the story, Vimes approaches what could be an inflammatory scene with a mindset of protecting the populace rather than inciting them to riot. Defenses provoke offense. Displays of arms &amp; armor are more of an invitation to fight rather than a deterrent. By promoting dialogue, disarmament, and cooperation, Vimes is literally able to change history toward less violent ends.

All that heaviness aside, it's still a Discworld book - that is to say, fantasy. There is a smattering of magic and a lot of humor. It helps to have a bit of a framework to understand the characters and the general feel of the Discworld universe, but you certainly don't need to have read the previous 27 books to enjoy it.",books,2036

After too much frustration of searching for the books I need, I decided it's time we index/catalog everything. Does anyone have any recommendations on what kind of software I might need? So far I've just been piecing everything together in an excel spreadsheet, but I'm worried this isn't going to be the best way in the long run. Our research library contains close to 4,000 books.

The first time I read it in undergrad, I fell in love and think it might be my favorite book of all time. It feels like walking through a curated art exhibition instead if reading a novel. I don't feel a lot reading most high modern/post modern texts. A lot of the time it feels like I'm watching a talent show, that storytelling takes a backseat to showing how smart the author is.

"His students called him Thompson. He began his career in a world without smartphones. Thirty years later, in a world dominated by them, he retired. The atypical element in a typical school, Thompson was constantly rankled by educators who did not educate, parents who did not parent, and leaders who did not lead, but his interactions with more than 6000 students, some of whom you will meet in these pages, inspired him to keep fighting the good fight. In and out of his overheated and overdecorated classroom, Thompson‚Äôs stories of students, colleagues, and family members serve as a backdrop against which he reflects on teaching, raising children, and navigating the cultural and educational overhaul that occurred between 1989 and 2019. Dancing Through Graveyards with Ninth Graders is a pre-Coronavirus memoir of American public schooling that is by turns funny, sad, absurd, angry, and ultimately hopeful.

I'm thinking my current book, The Tale of Genji (which refers to characters by rank, current residence, or familial relationship rather than names even though those constantly change between chapters without explicit mention), and my next book, another attempt at War and Peace (goddamn Russians), would be good candidates.",books,780
"I just finished this book this morning and I have to say, it blew me away. I watched the movie before I read the book and the movie was great but (understandably) omitted a ton of compelling stories. However I do feel like it was well done and portrayed the main case very well.

I did quite a bit of jail ministry last year at my local jail. I would meet with inmates and encourage them, pray with them, listen to them, etc. So the idea that people charged with a crime are of much more value than the American criminal justice system puts on them is not a new concept for me. But this book opened my eyes in a whole new way to the issues in our criminal justice system, from racial bias to mental illness to poverty. It was so informative and so moving and made me want to take action for the oppressed and forgotten.

My favorite chapter was entitled Mitigation. The story including the author(Bryan Stevenson), an inmate with mental illness, a correctional officer, and a chocolate milkshake. I was on the verge of tears reading that chapter.

"I have been a Stephen King fan since I was a kid reading Misery long after bedtime when my parents thought I was asleep. 
I cried with Gary in The Long Walk as he took his fate into his own hands. This book brought me to my knees in the worst way. The King continuously alters my universe. 

On the flip side, there are books we just don't click with. A DNF can cause guilt and frustration. 
I attempted and gave up on The Stand many times over the years, annoyed by Frannie and her immaturity. Her mother grated my nerves and I usually quit during their arguments. No more than 5% of the way through. 

2020 came and tossed my life into a blender and I watched my mental health turn to sludge. My little existence seemed to be spiralling out of control and there has been nothing in society to keep me grounded. Not only is my mental health suffering, but so is the entire world. 
This year has been a triumphant dumpster fire. 
But as I said before: timing is everything. 


So, I picked up The Stand one more time. Frannie isn't annoying, she's young. She's suffering. Her life was thrown into a blender and turned to sludge in front of her eyes... She's surviving any way she knows how. 
And now I'm in love with this book. I'm 25% of the way through and I'm already changing. I can feel this epic novel working it's way into my heart and brain and I can't get enough. If I'm not reading it, I'm thinking about it. You know the feeling. It doesn't happen too often but when it does you don't take it for granted.

"I finished this book today and liked its atmosphere as well as the childhood / coming of age aspects, in regard to those insecurities and anxieties etc. I really enjoyed the first half of the book but my interest waned pretty significantly in the second half, and I had to keep myself from wanting to skim the final couple of chapters. This was my first time reading Gaiman and while it was an enjoyabe and quick read, it fell a little short for me in the end. Somehow the fantasy elements diminished the immersion for me although I didn't necessarily disliked them. I just got bored. I don't think I want to give up on Gaiman right away, but I'd definitely like to find a book that takes a little further my favourite elements of this book. By him or a different author.

"This is a debate I‚Äôve been having with myself for awhile now. Classic literature has value for educational and entertainment purposes, but any book is a product of its time. I‚Äôm curious how you all approach the books touted as ‚Äúclassics‚Äù that are also racist, sexist, classist, etc.

To give an example, I picked up ‚ÄúOne Flew Over the Cuckoo‚Äôs Nest‚Äù recently for a book club. I got about three-quarters of the way into it before stopping. I can‚Äôt get over what is, to my mind, blatant sexism: women are either demonized or sexualized, when they appear at all. I can see how Cuckoo‚Äôs Nest must‚Äôve blown the top off the issue of psychiatric wards in the 60s, and it appears to shed a light on racial injustice as well. So it has its merits. But for casual reading? It just makes me really uncomfortable.

Obviously, each book is a unique case. How do you take them at face value?

"We all know the saying ""you get what you pay for"", but most inexpensive books in my collection are perfectly fine (and that includes 30+ year old thrift store finds). However, I have some I consider borderline unreadable. I don't know what I was thinking when I picked them up. Books with beige, see through, awful quality paper pages that feel like they're going to rip when you turn them, greyish ink, offensively tiny letters... Even one dollar is a dollar too much to spend on a book you won't bother reading and I know I'm not going to read a book like that.

So with that in mind, how would you rate the quality of Dover Thrift Editions books? I understand that due to the price point they're not going to be anything exceptional, but are they...okay?

"I've had an unfortunate run with a couple books I've read recently.  I basically hold barely enough interest in a book to read it until the end just waiting for the reveal or some kind of an event that will really tie the meaning of it all together only for there to be a rape scene in the last 40 or so pages that never gets resolved in any way.  Like at all.  I don't see any meaning in it and it's weird.

I really, really resent the idea of using sexual assault in a book for shock factor alone.  I don't mind it being in a book as long as it contributes to the story as a whole and is handled as what it is, classic example being The Kite Runner.  However, I've tried reading a couple newer books recently that have just, to say the least, been horrible for me.

Swamplandia!, and Mother Daughter Widow Wife are the two that come to mind.  Now, of course when this particular content occurs in either story it has the effect that it's meant to.  I'm disgusted, I'm confused, I'm hurt, I'm shocked.  It DOES add another dimension to the story and I will say that in both books there was a suspicion that it was going to happen eventually but there really wasn't that much of a warning.  What gets me the most is that the book is finished up in what seems like 20 pages after it happens.

So I guess my question is - does anybody have a different interpretation on this? Can anybody tell me if there is a meaning that I can't see past my trauma and disgust?  I think: ""Why widdle around with this poetic nonsense that complicates around in circles and then attach a rape scene and end it? Is it meant to replicate the feeling of the aftermath of sexual assault? That it comes unexpectedly and after it happens there is no resolve? That it's confusing and no one really knows what to do with it?""

I'm afraid to read newer sellers now because of this.  Sometimes it feels like every book that I'm gonna pick up will eventually lead to the inevitable rape scene.  It sucks.  Is there a way that any of you use to determine if it will happen in a book? ? ????",books,2059

"I've been into reading ever since 5th grade, and over time, I just developed a habit of reading very fast. It's not like I skip paragraphs or leave details unread, I just read a lot faster than my friends who also like to read. For reference, I am re-reading the whole Rick Riordian Greek mythology series and I finished the first 7 books in a week, a book each day. I recently read (and loved) The Hate You Give in a day (3 hours, give or take). I don't spend the whole day reading too; just a few hours because I have to complete my college work too.

But recently I've felt that maybe I'm doing something wrong, since my friends take relatively longer to finish the same book. I've noticed that I can read this fast mostly when I'm reading a certain genre, or a book I really like.

Does this happen with anyone else? I've had people say things like ""You don't read properly, and it's in vain."" and even ""You don't know how to read."" to me. It didn't bother me before, but I was wondering if anyone of you feels the same way.

"Many times I think of love because of Catherine she said, I am Heathcliff, and he will always be in my heart. Think of, will be moved, will be dejected.

The definition of love, is enchanted, is gentle, is helpless? At Wuthering Heights, love is a combination of fire and thunder, and many so-called loves are eclipsed in front of Catherine and Heathcliff. Be tempted, disappointed, break up, sad, then tempted, this is really love it, or just because of loneliness.

One was rebellious in nature, but had been brought up to be a lady of the manor. One was a sullen, recalculated gypsy orphan. But they have the same soul. Under the blue and purple sky of Wuthering Heights they ran hand in hand over marshes and meadows. In the dark attic they were beaten and starved, but huddled together, warmed by each other's warmth. Little souls with the same thirst for freedom. Heathcliff could endure a dark life because Catherine was his sun, but on that thunderous night, when he heard the news of Catherine's marriage, his last warmth disappeared. Catherine wept bitterly on the night of the thunderstorm, for a lifelong ailment that could not be cured.

But he came back, and the world was so desolate without her. He returns with mysterious possessions and plans for revenge, he wants his lover, and all else is insignificant. His dangerous black eyes were blazing with fire, but beneath his handsome exterior was a broken heart. When he thought happiness was coming, and he would never be alone in the cold hell, but she was in the struggle of love and hate, pale withered.

It was another thunderstorm night. The sky at Wuthering Heights was completely dark, broken only by sharp streaks of lightning. He stood under the tree all night, waiting for the news of his love, but even the last side, still missed.

Many times open this book before going to bed. And then quietly shed tears in the dark. This kind of love, many people will never meet.

"I don't even remember how many years I had lent the book to him, but when I stumbled into it while I was looking in the bookcase, I found that it had been rolled up, folded at the foot, worn and dusty. At that moment, I was angry and wanted to take it back. I said to him, ""I want to renew the love between Paul and Dunia.

Maybe you, like me, are familiar with Paul's story from the words of your parents and teachers. You have the flexibility to recite the name ""Ostrovsky"" on the tip of your tongue, and you have the vigor to recite the famous words ""One has only one life"" without any hesitation. However, you have never read the book completely.

We were so far away from that era that the Soviet snowstorm was just a view out the window of a warm huddle by the fire. The revolutions, the politics, the wars, the classes... Either I didn't understand it or I wasn't interested in it. In the swift turning of the pages, I searched only for the maiden's name -- Dounia.

As soon as the book opened, it was Paul and Dounia's first meeting, which was a delicate pencil sketch illustration: young Dounia leaned over from a bent willow tree and saw the dark fishing boy with bare feet. He folded the corner of the page, and I know that this passage has been read in our hearts a thousand times.

""She was wearing a white sailor dress with blue stripes over the collar and a short light grey skirt. A pair of lacy socks was wrapped tightly round the shapely sunburnt calves, and brown slippers were on the feet. Maroon hair in thick braids.""

This period of childhood reading tonya, amazement, originally in the distant, cold girl is such a dress, elegant clean, gentle and polite, with aristocratic breath, looked down at his crumpled red scarf and unclean white rubber shoes, heart disappointed and yearning, class, only beauty is our recognition.

Dounia is described by one of the novel's loony bad boys as ""a girl as sweet as a raisin, with a different flavor."" Strange to say, this metaphor is deeply imprinted on my heart, sweet as a raisin girl, is the concentrated sweetness of the sun in the sun, I think of Tonia running in the sun like a wind shoes clattering.

Both men stood panting, their hearts beating fast. Dounia was so tired from running madly that she lost all her strength. She seemed unwittingly quietly leaning on Paul, Paul felt she was so close. It was just a moment, but it stuck in my memory.""

The throb of first love is so fleeting. The beauty of this moment is pure and transparent, like a flower that has not been exposed to wind and frost for the first time.

I read their love with the same throb, sweet and sour. I remember Paul going to the barber's to cut off his tangled hair for Tonia and toiling to buy a blue shirt and black pants. At the edge of the cliff Dounia proud and abrupt test and Paul stubborn jump; And their misunderstandings, their worries, their goodbyes.

On the last night, in the quiet room, the clock signaled the departure six hours later. They spent it close together, hot as a kiss, bright as a flame. Paul accidentally touched the fingers of Dounia's chest, panic and trembling, quickly left.

"You must have a friend who works in a bank, looks average, does a decent job, has a wife and children, works hard to support his family, doesn't like to talk, but when he does speak, most of what he says is boring. In short, his appearance is so plain that he is a little person in the corner in any social situation. In fact, you probably have more than one such friend. In fact, you probably do.

Can you imagine this friend suddenly running away from home one day? Then, when you heard of him again, he was said to have arrived in Paris, and to be learning to draw from scratch, to be a painter.

It's hard to imagine looking around at all of my friends with these characteristics, and neither can I. But Maugham wrote about a man like this. His name is Charles. After leaving a note saying ""Dinner is ready"", he left his wife of 17 years and two children for Paris. He was forty years old, living in the most shabby hotel in All Paris, and had only one hundred dollars with him.

But this is not an inspiring story of how the dreamer overcame all odds to achieve greatness. If this is a story, the actor should be in his early 20 s, handsome, in the book, with beautiful daughter of a rich man, of course, will surely meet with a little jealous of his talent, the dog must compete for the lady with him, but justice will prevail over evil, male leading role to become a tycoon, lovers all's well that ends well.

The Moon and Sixpence is not such a story. What kind of story is it? The whole world was chasing dreams, but Charles was chasing his doom. Well, these two things are not so different. People who are captured by their dreams are chasing their own bad luck. Of course, the dream mentioned here is a real dream, not ""mom and dad said"", ""the teacher said"", ""television newspaper said"" is said out of the blueprint, not the blue collar above the white collar, not the hunter set the sparrow in the trap of the rice.

Charles galloped away and succeeded in catching up with his misfortune. Five years later, he was poor and ill in Paris, dying in a small attic and almost dying unless a friend saved him. Later, he became a street worker. A few years later, he was exiled to a small island in the Pacific where he fell ill with leprosy, lost the sight of his eyes, and had his masterpiece set on fire before he died. Within 15 years, the London stock trader had raced across the city, civilization, the middle class, the Pacific, and humanity to catch up with destiny.

""He lives at another level."" There's a line in The movie Big Night that Charles reminds me of. Other people's lives are in addition, he is doing subtraction. Every human identity is a kind of self-abduction, only to lose is the road to freedom. So Charles refused to be a ""husband,"" a ""father,"" a ""friend,"" a ""colleague,"" an ""Englishman. The ""I"" in the novel asks him, ""Don't you love your children?"" ""I have no special feelings for them,"" he said. I asked him again, ""Don't you even need love?"" And he said, ""Love only interferes with my painting."" Others may sympathize with his poverty, but when he picked up a paintbrush he felt like a king.

Of course such people are hateful. He only sees himself in the eyes of no one else. He is selfish, irresponsible and disdains any relationship with the ""society"". But he is innocent, for his eyes are not only without others, but even without himself. He didn't choose to dream, he was hit by a dream. In his own words, ""I have to draw, like a drowning man has to struggle."" If he is different from others, it is that he is more fatalistic than others. Dream how coquedarian, how sharp, people in panic to flee everywhere, fled to fame, or wealth, or seek fame and wealth but not resentment. But Charles refused to be one of the ""people"". There were sixpence all over the place, but he looked up and saw the moon.",books,3840
"I see this book as a departure from girlhood and a threshold into adulthood.

Capricious, permissive, stubborn, selfish, preening, and bearing in mind the pioneering manhood of his ancestors. The heroine Scarlett is not only different from the women in literary works, but also different from the perfect women in the secular standard. I can't seem to find any resemblance to myself. Because it's different, it's not easy to like -- the most objectionable thing about her is that in the beginning she was not interested in or knew anything about poetry or music or politics from which people could find relief. In the same way, being different, neither wholly absorbed nor wholly negated, it was impossible for me to analyse her judgment in detail, and I was suffocated by the variety and fullness of this figure. She dragged her through more than a thousand pages of the novel quickly.

If there is no war, we can't find her lovely; If there is no loveliness, we cannot find her weakness; If there is no fragility, I can't find her helplessness; If there is no helpless, I can not find her strong; If she had not been strong, she would not have survived the war. Without poetry or music, she had no way to escape but to face the naked reality and lead her family from hunger. Because there was no need for politics, she didn't care about the ""honor"" and ""freedom"" that men talked about, and she was just as great at filling her belly in battle as at charging into battle. As for her later controversial actions, because of this paragraph and do not have the heart to blame her. ""No choice is also a choice"", she changed again and again, but never changed, only magnified the environment magnified her personality. From the age of 17 or 18 had to bear the burden.

Not without regret, not without love, not without hurt. She had few friends until she lost them. It was not until she lost that anyone realized that she loved and loved her. When she was everything easy carefree bossiness girlhood she never thought of, in everything to her to decide the war destroyed homes already dream reality is only out of fear and hunger she never thought of, only the strong survive in rebuild the ruins of her vow to return to its former glory she had never thought of the toes. Only to return to the top of the pyramid only bleak review of gains and losses, found no one to accompany her witness to the final glory. The next day, he had to fight alone again.

If I want to find a character in Chinese literature to correspond with Scarlett, The first thing that comes to my mind is Xifeng Wang. Never need sentimental sentimental spring and autumn from the grand Garden sisters in the need for comfort. Their world is one of bustling bargaining and jockeying. Even if the material, even secular, but true, always full of vitality, disputed life is rich with a story. Strong, independent, confident, aggressive, do the life of the strong.

I think it will be fresh blood.",books,2961
"In such an era, in such a social context, there will be no way out for good people.

Xiangzi was a progressive young man, and all he wanted was a secure life. But how could a good man live a comfortable life in those days? Only the landlords who oppressed the people could make a good living for the officers.

It was a sad fate for Xiangzi. He managed to get his first rickshaw, only to lose it when an officer seized him, but he did not give up hope.

In the story, xiangzi was not the only one, but also the old horse and the pony, poor people as well. The pony died in the arms of the old horse, and the old horse had to live alone. It's just a fantasy. Rickshaw pullers and grassroots workers are exploited in the end, and no one can avoid it.

He was the car owner, and Tigress was his daughter. Tigress had tricked Xiangzi into marrying him, but The hard-working Xiangzi accepted the result and never gave up hope.

Of course, there is also a revolutionary who often makes Xiangzi's chariot. At that time, Xiangzi was extorted by Detective Sun out of the money he saved, and his hope of life became misty. However, after he married Tigress, Tigress bought me a rickshaw, and he could realize his dream of life with his own hands. Xiangzi's life was full of twists and turns, and his final outcome seemed doomed, because in the society at that time, good people could not live, it was the society at that time that drove people into ghost alive.

When Tigress had a hard time giving birth, Xiangzi sold the car tigress had bought for himself to save Tigress, but in the end it was empty and he lost hope again. But he still has a chance.

Therefore, I have to say a character, Little Blessing Son, she is a girl, but because the father only for pleasure, smoking cigarettes, is the representative of the dark task of the society at that time, he sold his daughter, just to get money. In the end, Little Blessing son committed suicide under such torture, and Xiangzi also completely collapsed. From an enterprising and uplifting youth, he turned into a social rogue, like a walking corpse, cheating and abducting, with a tragic ending.

But, as said at the beginning, his end is doomed, is the dark society forced him into a ghost, forced into a soul of the walking dead.

The tragedy of Xiangzi, and Lao She's writing, make us feel sympathy for Xiangzi. This book is very enlightening.",books,2391
"While telling the story to his son, he asked, Why not call me Robinson? By the way, in another animal story, there is a wandering rabbit named Robinson. It can be seen that in the longing for the wanderer's heart, Robinson is the distance is yearning.

This is, of course, a misreading of the story. Robinson from York city. Crusoe was influenced by the expanding power of the empire of the Sun never set. He thought that he walked into the endless sea from his soul with a wandering heart. He gets into trouble again and again and again and is rescued by God, and finally takes his faithful servant and friend, FRIDAY, back to his birthplace to spend his old age, and gives the story a rainbow of results.

There is an interesting clue in the story, which is the spiritual power Robinson got from God during his 28 years of life on the desert island, which made him think about the arrangement of the almighty God for his life. Friday asked why God allowed suffering and the devil to exist. Because, he thought, God wanted to give sinners a chance for reflection and redemption. Robinson in the selfishness might think he a heart the desire of the sea is the original sin, he was born to in order to enable him to realize his own iniquity, and in the process of our redemption, god again held out his hand to him, let him to sin to loose from the Dead Sea soul, and in the suffering of self-reflection and realize their own ridiculous. At last he realized that on his way home from Lisbon he had abandoned the sea for the overland haunt of wild beasts. The nomadic God seems to have spent most of Robinson's life ""redeeming"" him from his original sin. And comfortable after The Robinson is still floating in the sea.

Daniel. Defoe must be a very sensitive man. The psychological change of a day and a year after Robinson's landing on the desert island is so vividly described, especially the fear after he found the footprints and the subsequent response, which profoundly describes the mentality of an old man who has settled down in silence for more than ten years and has accepted the sudden change from reason. In this way, Robinson is portrayed as a lonely hero with flesh and blood and human delicate feelings, instead of being tall and whole enough to be annoying.

Perhaps, from the moment we walked upright, we were eager to be within sight. So man has crossed all the mountains and rivers of the earth. Say really a point is to open up territory to look for paradise, say some personality is hope to use two feet to measure the land, with sweat to enrich life. A life that is fulfilled is creative, and what is created is a by-product of measurement, giving the lazy a reason to be at ease.

Perhaps, this is also ""Robinson Crusoe"" by so many people like one of the reasons.",books,2786
"Author Jules verne is an imagination in the 19th century French science fiction writer, the surprising thing about him not only he wrote very exaggerated, the content of the beautiful and rich scientific significance of the novel, more surprise, written in the book of stories, in our present era is not surprising, but in his time, is not a submarine yet!

Professor Aronnax and his two companions set off on their voyage to the bottom of the sea aboard the Nautilus. The nautilus's owner was Captain Nemo, an eccentric, melancholy, and learned man who communicated in a language that Neither Professor Aronnax nor his two companions understood. Professor Aronnax wondered why captain Nemo alone understood the three languages. Captain Nemo invited them to travel with him through the Pacific and Indian Oceans, the Red Sea, the Mediterranean, the Atlantic, and the South and North poles. We have met many animals and plants, caves, tunnels and sites that we have never seen before.

It contained so much scientific knowledge -- geography, culture, geology -- that it was all contained in this book, and through Professor Aronnax's servant, conseil, who had a wide range of knowledge and loved to classify animals, the author informed us about the oceans and their mysteries. In the Red Sea, for example, tiny creatures called trichothrix secrete mucus that is responsible for the red color of the red sea, which is like blood. There are many, many things we don't know. I know them all through this book. . Aaron is beyond compare of captain nemo's talent and learning the admire, I also admire captain nemo's talent and knowledge generated, and I decided to see ocean of knowledge, understand the secrets of the ocean and magic, explore the depths of the sea treasures and wealth, I believe, in the near future, people will be able to make as good as nautilus ships.

Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea is not fabricated by the author out of imagination. It is science fiction accumulated by foresight and erudition. I admire the author's amazing imagination, rich knowledge and superb description techniques. For example, when writing through the Antarctic icebergs, the author makes the ice sea, icebergs and huge ice crevels come to life, making us feel as if we were in the Antarctic icebergs.",books,2303
"Behind Hemingway's profound and delicate description, he often feels an empty and lonely heart longing for recognition and self-realization. In the consciousness of their own experience, beating but always unable to free themselves from the thoughts of the catena.

&amp;#x200B;

In the book ""The Old man and the Sea"", the old man tries his best to prove his strength and is not willing to give in to his fate. Finally, he catches a big fish. Although the fish is eaten up by sharks, the huge skeleton is amazing, but he is exhausted... Was he content with that? In the face of a beautiful life, he wants to conquer as a fisherman, in fact, it is a self-actualized impulse in the drive. When he was trying to fight against his own fate at the same time, he was challenged, and finally could not escape the pain of frustration, and was defeated. In despair, at the same time, the old man began to regret the life of the big fish he had conquered and attacked by sharks...

&amp;#x200B;

The old man's heart reflects the contradictions, conflicts, and loneliness of so many of us... We are seeking for life force, the arrival of the achievement, want from this self confirm their identity with others, satisfied and happy, but desire is endless, and life is very short, eventually we may all like the old man exhausted, and still eventually return to their humble cottage, in the face of their own emptiness and loneliness.

&amp;#x200B;

What can we prove? Behind the heart of not to be outdone, we are small, but also lonely. If you can't face your own emptiness and find the meaning behind it, and the conflicts, disasters and sadness it brings, you will eventually get lost in the endless and increasingly distant search for yourself, and your life will be bogged down in endless struggles, contradictions and conflicts.

&amp;#x200B;

Read Hemingway, just like reading a lonely hardy himself again, this is a very self, and we should not just in their consciousness and thought, driven by thought and action of looking for the answer, because of the limitation of all this comes from experience, and seek self-expression desire is endless, life is limited, in this cycle, will be endless emptiness and sadness.

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes, try to sit quietly and face yourself. Life is lonely, if there is no love in the heart, everything will be meaningless, and make yourself empty. No one can accompany themselves for a lifetime, love is not dependent, not conquering, not occupying, not sensory pleasures, or memory fragments, and any form of thought occupy... When we no longer seek ourselves, but can truly experience our own loneliness and sadness and the endless beauty behind them, and in this experience release, love will come, without any dependence or fear, and the meaning of life will be different.

&amp;#x200B;

Hemingway's true and profound description, and the fate of the clever story behind, always reflect the truth - a sense of life alone, and any form of self-realization of the escape behavior in the final vain. We are the bearers of our hearts and the keepers of our energies. Without love, any kind of self would lead to tragedy. In this seemingly ordinary life, everything seems to be very small, our problem is not how to seek solace in solitude, but how to face your own truth, understand their real existence, it will not be lost, behind everything, nothing is the endless mystery and beauty, that is the most pure and rich life.

"Recently I've been going through books from self improvment area like ""Atomic Habits"" or ""Slight Edge"" and its kinda struck me, because in the past i simply refused to read that kind of books. Nowadays though I ended up having really hard time, some terrible things happened around and I was in need of rebulding myself as a person. I had to find my inner strenght to pursue virtues I once had. 

I do believe that each books in the world might have a significant impact on ourself if we pick the proper time to read it. Like, what extacly do we need? That's the answer we should answer. 

Of course there is reading for pleasure on our favorite sofa while in the background play chill slow music and our cat is purring loudly sitting on our lap. 

I just wanted to say that there are times when you will read something special, because of the time you decided to read it and the circumstances in your life. 

After my mom passed away I've been devastated but somewhere on reddit i found a guy mentioning this poem from 1927 written by Max Ehrmann. 

And it made a huge difference for me. I don't really know why. But it felt easier. I will copy the poem down below because it's truly awesome. 



Desiderata (Max Ehrmann-1927)

Go placidly amid the noise and the haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence. As far as possible, without surrender, be on good terms with all persons.

Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even to the dull and the ignorant; they too have their story.

Avoid loud and aggressive persons; they are vexatious to the spirit. If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain or bitter, for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.

Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. Keep interested in your own career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.

Exercise caution in your business affairs, for the world is full of trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals, and everywhere life is full of heroism.

Be yourself. Especially do not feign affection. Neither be cynical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment, it is as perennial as the grass.

Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth.

Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.

Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. You are a child of the universe no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here.

And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. Therefore be at peace with god, whatever you conceive him to be. And whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life, keep peace in your soul. 

With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be cheerful. Strive to be happy.

Thank you for reading.",books,3043

Now I'm midway through Deathly Hollows, and I don't want to finish it.  

Because, before the seventh book was released, my mother heard the rumor about JKR's laptop being stolen with a complete version of the seventh book on it.  She scoured the internet without finding it... but she thought she had.

"I just read a real-life news story that was so much like a posthumously published Robert B. Parker novel that it twisted my gut into a knot.  


First, here's the news article about the death of the real-life sexual assault victim who is the equivalent of the teen victim in Parker's posthumous novel:

 [https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/i4jbnu/daisy\_coleman\_from\_netflix\_documentary\_audrie/](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/i4jbnu/daisy_coleman_from_netflix_documentary_audrie/)

Now here's the Wikipedia article drawing the parallels between novel and real life:

 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daisy\_Coleman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daisy_Coleman) 

 

As in the novel, the rapist was a 17-year-old Popular Boy.  In real life he was the son of a rich political figure while in the novel he was a star player on the football team.  In both the novel and real life the rape victim was 14.  In both novel and real life the rapist got a slap on the wrist while the victim was bullied at school.  In real life the victim's family home was also vandalized.  Just as in the novel the victim and her family had to move out of town because of the harassment and awful memories and injustice, so in real life the victim's family moved out of state, and in adulthood the victim moved out of state yet again to live on her own.

Where real life diverges from the novel is that the novel ends with a downcast Jesse Stone feeling terrible about how things worked out but moving on with his life.  He doesn't try to contact the victim's family because it would only make things worse, and the victim conveniently disappears from the reader's mind at the end of the novel.  In real life the victim became an activist on teen sexual assault issues and took her own life at age 23.  The pain proved to be too much.

"I frequently see discussions in this sub about post-modern literature that more or less always devolve into confusion and frustration. For every comment one sees appreciating the works of a Wallace, Pynchon, or DeLillo, there are another five comments challenging the idea that these books have any merit whatsoever. (I‚Äôm not bemoaning these opinions, just setting the stage here)

The big sticking point people in this sub seem to have is that the ideas and traits of postmodernism seem, on a surface level, to contradict the very pleasures of storytelling.

With this I couldn‚Äôt disagree more. In my opinion, these books‚Äô alinear, fragmented, and morally ambiguous approach necessitates a level of reader interaction that almost amounts to an actual game. They‚Äôre like stories in puzzle form.

I should also address the contingent that have distaste for postmodernism on a philosophical level. There is a popular notion that it‚Äôs effectively a justification for the lazy and non-committal, and that one really has to accept the notions of unified cultural narrative that po-mo rejects in order to lead a practical life. My response to this is: postmodernism is not an endorsement of rejecting all cultural narratives. It is simply an acknowledgment of the fact that these narratives coexist, that existence is not defined by them, and that **no one can claim with 100% honesty to have the right answer**. 

Our lives are limited by the boundaries of our perception, and the mental narratives we construct of our lives are retrofitted onto the more-or-less random sequence of fragments that make up our existence. Postmodernism tells stories in a form that replicates this. It is a celebration of the true diversity and chaos of existence.",books,1740

So my question is: While reading a book, when do you look at it and say ""this book is pure garbage, it's time to stop"" and when do you say ""Maybe I should keep reading a little more, it will get better"".",books,538
"I just finished this book; it was an easy read I finished in two days. It is a memoir of a public defender working in Brooklyn, who experiences a psychotic break. The chapters alternate between his journey through the mental health system to vignettes of his and his mother‚Äôs upbringing in Wichita Kansas.

Explored is drug use and substance culture, the efficacy of rehabilitation/mental wellness inpatient programs, the inability to give true justice to people on the fringes of our society. 

The book has a very potent message of the power of family and community in overcoming suffering, as well as the legal system‚Äôs oppression of the mentally ill. It is a fantastically moving and haunting read, I highly recommend it!",books,725
"Recently I read ‚ÄúGideon the Ninth‚Äù followed by ‚ÄúA Memory Called Empire‚Äù... and I hated both books.  Normally I love science fiction books, and these are both 2020 Hugo nominees with very high reviews on Goodreads. 

I found ‚ÄúGideon the Ninth‚Äù to be pedantic. It was melodramatic, juvenile, and filled with jargon that was hard to understand for no apparent reason. It had terrible world-building and characters that I didn't care about at all.

‚ÄúA Memory Called Empire‚Äù, on the other hand, was just a long drawn-out story about nothing. They literally took the Trill from ‚ÄúStar Trek: Deep Space Nine‚Äù and made a character based around that... and then sent her to a planet where she talks for the entire book. Ostensibly, she's searching for the person that killed the previous ambassador‚Ä¶ but she could be talking about baking or watching paint dry and you would get the same effect. The whole thing could be a technical document. 

I had to read some Joe Scalzi just to get the bad taste out of my mouth. I don't know if I'm just not enjoying today's authors, or if there's something about books that are coming out recently that is different than books in the past.  I've been relying on old books, even so far back as Arther Conan Doyle and H.G.Wells, to pass the time.  Those guys were far better than today's authors... as far as I can tell. 

Maybe I'm just really getting older but it seems to me todays‚Äô authors can't hold up.",books,1435
"The hunting Party by Lucy Foley is excellent. I could absolutely not put it down! The subtle twists and turns definitely kept me on my toes.  It is Agatha christie reincarnate. I normally hate when a book flashes back and forth and time and when the narrator changes every chapter.  However, these were utilized so well in this book it actually added to the experience for me! Would highly recommend.",books,400
"My reading habit has taken a backseat now for quite sometime. Other than Reddit and Quora, I don't really read a lot. However, I used to be an avid reader.
Few years ago, I was deeply into Fantasy and Science Fiction. From the likes of Brandon Sanderson to Isaac Asimov, I was reading whatever interested me.
Recently, I wanted to light that spark again and got into reading Dune by Frank Herbert. Hearing such nice things about it, I want to delve deeper into what the man had to say.
Alas, it only lasted a few chapters. A friend told me it's tough to get into the flow but darn, the storytelling just doesn't 'get' me. I try again, time after time, to get into it but it's not happening.
This has led to some guilt and frustration I want to get over with. How do you deal with something of this sort?",books,803
"So for some context, in Norway we have this thing called *s√¶remne*, that is in many ways meant to be your final big evaluation as far as Norwegian literary skills go. The gist of it is, in your third year of what I suppose would in US terms be High School (?), you're forced to pick two books and compare them and write an essay or conduct a presentation about their differences and similarities. Now a few decades ago, you'd stand pretty freely to choose any piece of fiction you'd want, so long it be fiction it wasn't all that important who wrote it or its exact contents, but in recent years it's been stipulated that it must be Scandinavian literature. As an avid English reader, it didn't initially floor me, but today after weeks of neglect, I finally picked up *Bl√• (The End of the Ocean)* by Maja Lunde and, to my surprise, I couldn't stop until I had finished every last sentence.

*Blue*, as I will henceforth use the directly translated title, is a marvelous piece of compact, well-paced fiction that never ceases to grip its reader and delivers thoughtful and insightful commentary throughout with absoloutely stellar writing. Following the perspectives of both Norwegian 67 year-old climate-activist Signe and her journey of lost love in 2017, and that of French climate-refugee David and his daughter Lou in 2041, Lunde beautifully twists the two perspectives about eachother, tying them up in an ending that, without spoiling too much, nearly broke me to tears.

The central theme in *Blue* is undoubtedly water, or the human effects on it, be it climate change or other. Signe's struggle is one of excess, of glacial melt and storming waves, of the rain that pounds the vessel from where the novel derives its name, and her own struggles with how control of the water has shaped her life, and her relations to those around her. David's on the other hand, is one of scarcity, of desperation as it becomes ever more clear society is bursting at the seams, and how morality becomes foggy in times of crisis. It's a story about how our actions have consequences on the world at large, but also how it effects our most intimate of relations. It's a story that makes one think, think not only about the future, but about how we shape our world right now. 

And even then, it's not a story that holds back on asking a few difficult questions. While undoubtedly not denying the impacts of climate change, quite the opposite, Lunde still manages to include a few difficult questions that still plague the activist movement today, and the way she almost puts the two perspectives at odds while doing so is nothing short of fantastic. It really goes a way in creating this doubt as to what's really right and wrong, and it made me rethink my own stances on the issues brought up, while also serving as a stern warning of things to come.

I've been trying to say as little as possible about the actual plot in this book, because I really feel it is one that as many as possible should read on their own to get the full experience. It is genuinely a shame that they chose such a generic title as *The End of the Ocean* for the English release of this book, as it really hides what masterful writing actually lies beneath. Even as a proclaimed climate activist, it really made me rethink a lot of what I stand for, and holding up a glass of water as I read the final words of the novel, made me appreciate something I'd otherwise take for granted.",books,3450
"Just to briefly name a few you've got J R R Tolkein, CS Lewis, Ray Bradbury, Kurt Vonnegut, Daniel Keyes, Frank Herbert, Ian Fleming, etc.

Lord of the Flies, Dune, LOTR, any of the works by Bradbury and Vonnegut, etc.

"Several years ago, I set a goal for myself to read one non-fiction book for each country in the world. About a year in, I realized how many fiction books I'd read for other countries, so I amended the goal to one fiction and one non-fiction book for each country. To count, the book has to be:

1. a book about the country; or
2. a book set in the country; or
3. a book written by an author from the country; or 
4. a book about a character from the country

Disclaimers: 

1. My list is not perfect. You'll definitely be able to think of a better book than the one I read for a particular country (I know there are a lot of Western authors and travel books).

"Due to covid our library shut down, and now is offering curbside pick up but I'm still a bit leery of that option so I thought I would see what sources that are legitimate (nonpirated) and has a wide variety of books to read online that you have used or enjoy? 

I've found a few online sites, and I know there's Google books and the like, but I'm really missing the low cost (ok, free) and selection of my library! 

If this post isn't allowed here, please direct me to a more suitable place to post! Thank you!",books,512
"Hello! I hope everyone is doing well.

I come here today because I'm having some issues with my reading. I've really enjoyed fantasy books that are less serious in tone -- think light novels, random works on various websites by random people, and books that don't have a distinct prose or deeper meaning.

I have also been trying to read Discworld (Book 1) and Tolkien (Hobbit), but I just cannot get behind them for some reason, despite them being in the genre that I like, and both regarded as master-class books. I also read The Name of the Wind, and I didn't get it at all!

I'm worried because I really want to enjoy these books, and I feel like I should. I also feel not reading this books will make me a worse writer -- I really enjoy writing.

I think there are several possibilities, and I'd love if I could get some insight.

To start, I am a teenager. If this is all stuff that will come in time, please let me know. I am aware that I don't have a very deep understanding of the world yet, and I'll be the first to say that I don't know very much.

 Other than that, the first problem (and the biggest) is that I read way too fast. However, going slow is really difficult for me... are there any tips here? Or is this just a case of self-control being needed? I can probably force myself to read slower, but it's tricky for me to focus for that long.

The second issue seems to be that I don't pick up on the tones of the characters. Sometimes I don't understand their personalities, and even when I do, it can be tricky picking up subtleties in dialogue, like sarcasm. Should I just be reading them in my head as specific voices, or do I just need to focus more? I know it's probably a symptom of the speed that I read at, but I do slow down on dialogue... and I still miss out on so much!

Finally, it's very possible that I'm just not suited toward these books, or I'm too stupid to understand them in their entirety. If this is the case, then will I also be unable to write compelling books? Do I need to study the connotations of words more? I feel like it all stems from a lack of understanding, but I don't know how to understand.

And if I am simply unable to comprehend the glory of these books, then do you have suggestions on types of books I'd enjoy? I struggle with YA because the themes are just so... boring so much of the time! It's very possible I'm just a picky reader, but sometimes the characters are just so childish!

I really do enjoy reading, and I'd love to read more... any tips would be amazing. 

Thank you all for your time, hope you have a great day!",books,2591
"I haven't read many books on the subject of Love. While I'm really liking the book so far, I'd like to see some criticisms of the book or other points of view in order to not adopt the view of the first thing I come across.

"I‚Äôm at page 250 in Pet Sematary when Gage‚Äôs funeral is over. I see a lot of people on this subreddit saying it‚Äôs a very scary book but nothing that scary has happened yet.

"Well, i guess ill start. Michael Moorcock... To many known mostly for Elric of Melnibone, mr. Moorcock is much more than every other fantasy writer. I started with Elric and while not that impressed i still continued with other Moorcock's characters of Multiverse. As i read more and more and more it just clicked and while you read you suddenly get that realisation that Moorcock is far from usual fantasy writer... Truly shaped my thoughts and overall way of thinking and dealing with many things, amazing author and breathing books!!!",books,537
"Honestly Lovecraft is not a good writer, his books have a language two dense while saying to little, the pace of his stories is slow, he is not close to be a writer like Poe, he lacks the talent, and is unable to entertain the reader like Stephen King does. In addition to this he was racist and misogynistic, and that can be seen in his stories.

But despite all of this many people including myself are fascinated with his particular horror world. It's probably because getting to dive into his world is like solving a puzzle using many of his stories to get an idea of one of the most influential worlds in fiction, the one of the Cathulu Miths.

Even if his talent as a writer is discutible there's no denying his creativity and his influence in modern horror, so dive in his stories... Or maybe not, meh do whatever you want",books,829
"I have to say, people really overrated it. I feel bad to voice an unpopular opinion but this has to be said.

I read a comment on reddit which said that the person cried through the last 15 pages. I mean, the book is sad and makes you think. But weeping throughout the end? Come on.

I'm definitely not saying that it is a bad or even an average book. It is, in fact, a good one. It is surely a book that helps you gain some perspective, and is a short and easy read. But by no means, did I feel, that it is a **Must Read** book.

If you feel that I'm wrong, please tell me why!?",books,579
"I‚Äôve been working in COVID-19 response for the past 5 months. I‚Äôm pretty fried. I usually read to unwind, but have found myself unable to engage with my usual selections during this time.

Rather than sticking with my tried and true ‚Äúserious‚Äù fare, I opted to try out a trashy action/sci-fi page turner (no, I‚Äôm not going to name it, or what I normally read, because I don‚Äôt think it matters).

There are grammatical errors, clumsy metaphors, obvious plot twists, and over the top characters with terrible dialogue.

"Thought this was such an interesting read! I tend to read books that have teenagers as the protagonists, as I am a teenager myself, so I was unsure at first since it was different to what I have read previously, however it really lived up to the hype.
I felt as if I was following Eleanor‚Äôs personality develop as opposed to following a storyline (?? does that make sense?), just intrigued by her unique ways and how she thinks, as well as wanting to find out what happened in her past.

"A satirical novel by Amy Sedaris, Paul Dinello, and Stephen Colbert.

This is probably the funniest book I have ever read. I borrowed the audiobook on CD from a friend many years ago and I recently read it again in regular book form.

It‚Äôs about a town full of malcontents that are dealing with how a planned dam will flood and destroy their town.

It is told as a bunch of interviews with the townsfolk who are a cast of the most ridiculous characters you can imagine. If you enjoy the comedy style of Strangers with Candy you will dig it.

The audiobook version is amazing because the authors do the voices of the various characters. The paperback version holds up though and it is still hilarious. For some reason the audiobook is not available on Audible but I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs available somewhere.

I never hear anyone talk about this book which is a shame. Did a bit of searching on reddit and didn‚Äôt fine any discussions of it. It came out in 2003 before Colbert became a household name. I feel like it had been published in 2015 it would have been a massive bestseller hit.

If you haven‚Äôt read it, it‚Äôs totally worth a read.

"_ASURA BY ANAND NEELAKANTAN_

Moral of the story is  

Woman will distract you from building empire. We fall into the traps of lust and forget our mission and face consequences  

Example from the book : "" if the king had ignore the woman and continued Conquering the World he would have Increased his empire. But he didn't do that. he had sex with the woman then started impressing her leaving campaign and ambition behind ,ending up in prison.

  Years later when he decided to build again he goes again after another man's wife he abducts her and held captive and starts a war  against her husband.

 ""betraying seeps in""

 And he starts losing everything because of her.he loses  money,empire,brothers, friends, ministers, sons, his enemies made his beloved wife lying naked in his fort  and he turned to ash in the end on his funeral pyre

So what I learned from the reading is never chase Woman.
Remain calm. Harness our Lust.

And start building empires.",books,961

"Typing that out, it sounds pretty weird. What I mean is, how do you perceive words in a book?

Do you create a voice in your head for each of the characters and then play that voice when they speak? Do you read in a uniform voice throughout the entire book? Do you even use a ""voice"" when you read? I'm curious on how other people actually \*read\*",books,348
"I'm so disappointed, I want to love this saga but I can't. Usually I love fantasy and science fiction but I feel like I just read a thousand pages of introduction to a great story, and I don't like that, it feels exhausting. Like... nothing really happened until the last part. The rest was just repetitive, pages and pages of the same thoughts. Shallan's story was practicly irrelevant until the end of the book, and pretty boring as well until that moment. I wanted to like it so much because Sanderson is  very prolific author, but right before reading this I read some Rothfuss books and they were so much easier to follow. I know that Sanserson's universe is way more complete but his writing is way more boring. I don't want to follow the saga but probably I will because I want to like this author so bad!!! What do you guys enjoy more about Sanderson? Do you have any book recommendations for me?",books,904
"This is a call to anyone who's read Martin Amis's The Zone of Interest:

It looks intriguing to me, but as an Amis novice, I'm weary as to whether I should risk spending what little money I have on a book I very well may dislike.",books,268
"*This post contains mild spoilers for the first four books in the Odd Thomas Series.*

I really liked the first Odd Thomas book and finished it pretty quickly. I thought it had a lot of interesting twists and found myself caught up in the book's quirky action hero. 

The second book I liked mostly because of the setting. I really like when characters explore huge abandoned settings and the dilapidated hotel in the middle of the desert was a great stage for book two. 

Book three again was another winner for me. I love the setting of a monastery in winter, though I must admit the books 'villain' felt like it didn't really sit right with the genre. Don't get me wrong, I thought the concept was cool, but for a paranormal series it just seemed like sci-fi swung out of the left field a little bit. 

Now i'm on book four and *oh boy*, this book has been a drag. At this point i'm one hundred pages from the end and not vested in the outcome at all. I'm not even exaggerating when I say that Odd spends the first quarter of the book crawling about underneath a pier and hiding in shadows. It makes me feel like Koontz had to write this one on a deadline and just phoned it in.

I'm definitely in the camp of 'don't waste time reading books you don't enjoy' but i'm pretty deep into this series now time-wise, and I kind of want to find out what happens between Odd and Stormy at the end. 

This post probably reeks of sunk cost fallacy, because let's face it, that's the conundrum I find myself in. If anyone has finished the series i'd love to know if it's worth pushing on or not. At this point I'm half tempted to call it a day and look up spoilers on youtube or something, just to find out how the series ends.",books,1719

"I recently read Lovecraft Country in anticipation of the upcoming HBO series. 

 I've always loved Lovecraftian and cosmic horror, but I have also often struggled with separating the stories and their influence on horror from the contemptibly racist views of Lovecraft himself. On one hand, you often have people who will try to completely disregard or downplay Lovecraft's racism, saying things like ""Almost everybody was racist back in his day,"" which ignores the reality that even among his peers and contemporaries, Lovecraft's racism was particularly excessive, and sometimes is present in his stories to such a degree as to be almost inseparable from the narratives themselves. On the other hand however, you have people who read ""The Horror at Red Hook,"" or have heard the factoid about the unfortunate naming of Lovecraft's cat, don't bother to look any deeper, and dismiss all of Lovecraft's work as racist, and his legacy as irredeemable. One friend I know even goes so far as to suggest that most of Lovecraft's stories are ""racist trash,"" and that cosmic horror is not a real genre, and that this ""non-genre"" is characterized only by the poorly disguised white racial anxieties of the period.

Lovecraft Country is one of the first works of Lovecraft-influenced fiction I've read that tries to recognize and confront both of these extremes. It unequivocally condemns the racism of Lovecraft, even in the title. ""Lovecraft Country"" is 1950's (and perhaps even present-day) America, a country that fears and hates 'the other' as Lovecraft did. Yet racism and bigotry the (black) protagonists face every day, every page, is, in some sense, a very Lovecraftian type of horror: the recognition and constant fear of an all-powerful entity, of an old god, who is so vast and all-encompassing as to be almost incomprehensible, who is at best indifferent and at worst malevolent, who sees you as nothing more than an infestation of vermin to be tolerated or eradicated. This, Lovecraft Country suggests, is and has been the reality for black people in America constantly living under the boot of racism and white supremacy. 

On the other hand however, most of the black protagonists are themselves avid readers and fans of Lovecraft. The book acknowledges that Lovecraft and other authors of ""weird tales"" have had many readers of color who were, as the author puts it, ""stabbed in the heart"" by the racism of authors they loved so dearly. These readers were often mocked and called out, not only by bigoted white people who couldn't imagine a black person being a ""nerd"" or a fan of comics and science fiction, but by other black folks who regarded enjoying authors like Lovecraft as tantamount to being an ""Uncle Tom."" Matt Ruff recognizes and empowers these black Lovecraft fans by giving them their own Lovecraftian stories in which they are placed front and center with full agency and humanity, in a genre which has historically relegated people who look like them to being side characters at best, and monsters at worst. The villains in Lovecraft Country, more often than not, are either white people desiring more power for themselves, or eldritch abominations summoned by said white people.

Lovecraft Country also takes Lovecraft's story-writing priorities and turns them upside down. Lovecraft, aside from his racism, was notoriously bad at writing characters. His primary focus was mostly on the weird and horrific aspects of the story: the aliens, the monsters, the abandoned cities, the strange sounds in the night, and the darkness at the edges of reality. Characterization came second, if at all, and you can tell his characters, even his protagonists, are usually nearly empty vessels through which the reader can experience whatever horror Lovecraft has dreamed up. In Lovecraft County, Ruff does the opposite. The main focus, the main drive of the story, is the characters: their feelings, their personalities, their experiences and motivations. The cosmic horror comes second, and exists to provide a backdrop against which the characters can develop further.

\*VERY MILD SPOILERS IN THE NEXT PARAGRAPH\* 

In fact, the one criticism I had of the book was that many of the characters didn't seem particularly perturbed or unsettled by all of the occult weirdness going on around them, they just seem to take it in stride for the most part. Discovering an occult society intent on seizing ultimate power? The protagonist's attitude is almost like ""meh, typical, let's get this over with."" Ancient blood-rituals to summon otherworldly entities? Walk in the park. Traveling across the universe and witnessing tentacled monsters rip people apart? Eh, just another day I guess. Re-animated voodoo dolls intent on murder? Huh, that's mildly interesting. Defeating dark cosmic forces comes pretty easily to this gang, even the defeat of the main antagonist is rather anti-climactic. But perhaps that's the point, to illustrate that the real evil is not inter-dimensional horrors, but every-day racism and bigotry. 

\*END OF SPOILERS\*

I could talk some more about this book, but this post is getting rather long, so I'll just leave it there and save more discussion for the comment section. Overall, I really enjoyed the book and would recommend it to anyone. You don't have to be a Lovecraft fan to enjoy it, but being one will probably increase your appreciation.",books,5385
"I‚Äôm currently ~100 pages into the book. I‚Äôm liking it and enjoying it, but I can‚Äôt help but feel like not getting many actionable insights from it.

I find reading about intrinsic biases very interesting, and I‚Äôm fascinated about the way the human mind works, but I‚Äôm not feeling like I‚Äôm not getting anything groundbreaking.

Right now the book could be distilled into the following sentence: Don‚Äôt jump into conclusions and think things through in order to not make a mistake. I don‚Äôt know if my expectations weren‚Äôt the right ones, but I feel the past sentence is nothing anyone didn‚Äôt know. 
Of course having factual evidence is great, and anecdotal experience is not much to go on.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong. I‚Äôm enjoying the book and understand the implications of things like biases being scientifically proven and recorded.

I‚Äôm not sure the book would help me have better decision making besides reminding me to actually think things.

I‚Äôm a Financial Management major, and I‚Äôm no stranger to the study of behavioral economics and usually enjoy reading academic journals just for the sake of it. I understand the book is supposed to be a summary of Kahneman and Tversky‚Äôs work. I however was kinda expecting more of a ‚Äúhow to‚Äù in a book, in contrast to an academic or psychological journal‚Äôs more expository nature. Perhaps I fell prey to the hype reviews of the book.

In contrast: I recently read a much more simple book marketed towards high school students by Barbara Oakley called A Mind for Numbers. It is tangentially related in the matter that it also deals with two thought modes, but with a focus on learning. I found this book very easy to read, and very actionable in order to actually change the way in which I approach material I want to learn.
It also explained the why X or Y happens, while also helping you actually do something to improve your learning.
I‚Äôm currently feeling Thinking, Fast and Slow is just telling me ‚ÄúHumans are biased in several ways and jump to the wrong conclusions, but sometimes they think slowly about it and they don‚Äôt‚Äù.

It seems I‚Äôm the vast minority in my opinion. I think I could potentially blame the aforementioned hype reviews that claimed that the book changed their whole way of thinking and set me up for unrealistic expectations. I could have come with the wrong approach in mind towards the book and have fallen prey to System 1.

In case anyone got the wrong idea. I‚Äôm not thrashing or undervaluing Kahneman‚Äôs work. He‚Äôs a hugely respected figure in my field and a pioneer. I‚Äôm more questioning what the purpose of the book is, or what it wants to achieve in the reader besides making them more conscious that they are prone to subconscious mistakes.

I‚Äôm still only 1/3 into the book and my opinion could be swayed to either side. I‚Äôm curious to see what others think about this, or if perhaps someone could tell me what I‚Äôm missing.",books,2894

"So I have owned the book for almost 24hours, and i'm over halfway through it. Forcing myself to take a break to savor it, but I can't stop thinking about it so turning to reddit to get my fix. 

I was a major twilight fan growing up, so the nostalgia trip is insane right now. As a person in my twenties I have the giddiness of a 12 year old girl again. 

As for the read, I am finding it ""slow"" just from the point of the book is mostly crazily extended because we're reading from the viewpoint of Edward.... and all the other people's thoughts. It makes it a very heavy read, but that does not stop my infatuation with the book. I find it really interesting to read, and my giddiness is never ending. And it is revolutionary (strong word, my opinion :) to see Bella from this point of view, reading how painful it is for him to be with her, but he can't not be with her. I don't want to have a preference between which point of view I like more, because they each are valid and interesting in their own view. Maybe it's because all my feelings are rushing back, but the writing of Edward's point of view is so flowery, educated and mature from the point of view of an old man, but immature and jealous from the view of a teenager. It is so interesting. 

Anyway, big fan so far. I never thought I would feel this young again. What is everyone else thinking so far??

"During this period of quarantine, I invested heavily in a lot of new books. But I love sharing and discussing books, so I offered to let friends borrow them whenever they‚Äôd like. 

However, I paid good money for these books and I‚Äôm not exactly wealthy (yay being a teacher‚Äî love the job, not the pay). 

Someone is finally asking to borrow a book (hooray!) and this is the system I‚Äôve come up with:

1. Write down in a notebook the name of the friend borrowing, title of the book, and date loaned out. 

2. Attach a post it on the last page that says: ‚ÄúHope you enjoyed the book! Before you return it, share a thought you had!‚Äù Another post it would be under and it would be a super fun way for me to see what others thought about the book and it would be a good reminder to the friend that the book is to be returned. 

3. Tell the friend who‚Äôs borrowing that I‚Äôll follow up with them in a month about the book! (I would text them in a month and ask how they liked the book and if they still need more time, whatever that‚Äôs fine. It would just be a way for both us to keep track of the book.)

Obviously, there‚Äôs always the chance that I won‚Äôt get the book back, but what do you think about these preventative measures? Have any of you found a system that works in keeping track of and getting back loaned out books?",books,1317

"Hey, I recently read East of Eden and loved it. I have a few minor complaints, but it remains great on my mind. But one thing that annoyed be was the character of Aron. Maybe you guys can help me out with this.

Aron is the good/Abel brother of the story, in relation to Cal, the bad/Cain brother. And he is supposedly the being with no sin/bad on him. Now, I vehemently disagree with this, Aron being self-absorbed and careless to the point of cruelty; and at times prone to violence. Aron's ""lack of evil"" came of as Cathy's ""lack of good"", he is much closer to her than Cal ever was. But I don't think Steinbeck or the book are necessarily advocating for Aron here, him being described as strikingly similar to Cathy in appearance; and I think he is more of a twisted figure of what Cal thinks a good person would be. My issue lies with him being sometimes described as a lovable person, that everyone just likes by default. And I just don't buy it.

On Brothers Karamazov, Dostoyevsky straight up opens the book saying Alyosha is the hero of the story, and he is so likable everyone wants him around, and gives him free stuff while feeling grateful to him. This got to the point of me pondering why in the world was he still a good character and didn't come of as a Mary Sue. But it works. Alyosha is one of the most lovable characters I've ever seen, and everyone I know that read the book, myself included, wants to be more like him. He is kind, fun, and comes of as without sin/bad on him, while being also mindful of others. Meanwhile, I honestly can not see how anyone would even like Aron.",books,1599

Tell me, are Hemingway's books that good? Because to me, his writing is mediocre to bad at best. Granted, I've only read one of his books, *For Whom the Bells Tolls,* so I can't say that it applies to all his writing. But people praise that as one of his best! After that book, I seriously do not want to go anywhere near his books. ever. again. The book was just so boring to me, so much ""Ok... and that's good?'  


Looking online, I've only seen people praising him for his fantastic writing, and I feel like I read the wrong version of his book or something. For me, it was a drag from beginning to end, sprinkled with sex scenes that only a 13-year-old boy would find exciting, topped off with a death scene that dragged on and on like a murderer dragging his victim through the forest.

"Unfortunately I'm the type of person that tends to stress over typos. I know they're common enough, but what really bothers me is typos in new books. I'm currently reading Robert Holdstock's 1984 *Mythago Wood.* There have so far only been two typos and I'm on something like page 184. That's good. However, it still deeply irks me because the second typo was so severe. In one sentence the words ""sent his"" were meant to be ""seen this."" The only way I figured this out is because I searched online. I downloaded a free version of the book... which didn't have this typo. What if someone didn't think of doing this? Are they supposed to just accept it and have a lesser experience? I can see how this would occur in OCR, but surely a book which happens to be printed in 2014 on the 30th anniversary should have no errors at all. That's such a significant typo to me that it really bothered me and put me off reading the rest of the night. 

I used to read on Kindle, but the amount of typos in digital books was one of the reasons I returned to physical. I'm just now realising that certain books aren't really as well made and reputable as they I thought they were. Just because it's in proper book form doesn't mean they're any higher in quality. So what exactly are we paying for? I read *Lud-in-the-Mist* by the same publisher, Gollancz, and there was probably 15 or more typos in that book. Both of these books were published relatively recently, the latter originally written in the 1920s. How on earth can new editions of books have typos? They must have been read so many times. It's frustrating as it makes me feel as if I'm reading some cheap knock-off work and not a real book. It takes me out of the feeling of reading a story by a reputable author and the feeling lingers. I suppose it's as if the power and 'official' status of the book is diminished. It's not just that one publisher though; typos seem to be more prevalent than I ever considered before.",books,1969

"I've been trying to get into more litfic/contemporary fiction recently, and it feels like almost everything I pick up is about disaffected, disillusioned, unambitious millennials. I'm thinking about books like Ma's Severance, Offill's Weather, Wilson's Nothing to See Here, Mandel's The Glass Hotel, Rooney's Conversations With Friends... I'm not sure if it's a trend or if I have bad luck.

I'm not saying that I need my protagonists to be happy-go-lucky or anything, but I think I find it a lot more interesting if they have some sort of drive. I'm reading Atwood's Hag-Seed right now and am really enjoying it, in part because the protagonist definitely has drive. (Okay, his ambition is to take revenge on his former friend who manipulated the theatre board to kick him out of his position as theatre director while he was trying to stage a production of *The Tempest* to honour his dead daughter. It's not a *healthy* ambition. But it's there, and very entertaining.) I'd like to read more books like that, but also with younger protagonists.

Have you guys noticed this trend or is it really just bad luck on my part? Do you enjoy that type of character?",books,1160
"It's been about half a decade since I bought Rick Riordan's Trials of Apollo. After a bit of reading and rereading, I've pretty much left them untouched under a drawer for a long time, at least until I bought the fourth instalment in the series a few weeks ago and remembered my fond memories of finally getting my hands on Rick Riordan's books! I went back to take a look at them and was quite shocked at what I saw - even though I haven't read them in a year, when I opened them to look at their contents, their pages were a brownish yellow and tiny brown spots were all over the place!

Misleading title aside, sorry for the clickbait, I just couldn't bring myself to read them any longer. It feels as though their condition gets worse and worse every time I flip through them. I wish I took better care of them and kept them in a comfortable place, instead of just shoving them underneath a drawer. Oh well, too late for regrets!",books,933

"In no order:

-The entire Wheel of Time Series: this is cheating, but whatever. This isn‚Äôt the best fiction or writing I‚Äôve ever read, and it‚Äôs no where close to it, but it‚Äôs the most significant literary journey I‚Äôve ever taken. It‚Äôs 14 books long, and it took me 16 years to finish cause I had to keep coming back and back to it. It‚Äôs the biggest commitment a ‚Äúbook‚Äù has ever taken from me.

-Paradise Lost: I love epic poems and was raised Catholic. This poem tells all the ‚Äúprequels‚Äù that the Bible doesn‚Äôt. The writing is also phenomenal. Idc what anyone says. This guy shits all over Shakespeare. Some people find it difficult to read, but if you read it slowly, I think you‚Äôll grasp it eventually. Also has a sequel!

-The Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison: this is probably one of the most important books I‚Äôve ever read in my life. It helped me greatly in learning about and coming to terms with my identity. It‚Äôs form is also incredibly experimental and creative for its time. This is a book that I think all people of color should read. I think it must resonate very differently for those who experience racialization.

-Invisible Man: In my opinion, the best piece of prose fiction in American literary history. The opening two paragraphs are absolutely perfect writing. And like Morison‚Äôs Bluest Eye, it was incredibly formative for me, and it‚Äôs a must read for POC. 

-Salvage the Bones by Jesmyn Ward: In my opinion, the best contemporary writer of American literature. Woman won the National Book Award twice, and the only other person to win it twice in a shorter timespan was this one guy named William Faulkner. Her stories are utterly depressive because of the topics she writes on, but I‚Äôve never had a writer pull me in and make me feel that somber emotion from start to finish like Ward. She‚Äôs one of the few writers whose entire bibliography I can read and love every single book. This is her best novel in my mind, and one of the best pieces of ‚Äúhistorical fiction‚Äù whose historical event I have lived through and saw its trauma firsthand.

"I just finished reading Discrimination and Disparities and found it really eye-opening.

Basically, he spends most of the book arguing against the ""social vision"" that we should *expect* different groups of people to have similar outcomes, and to assume that if they don't then that must be due to biased impositions from outsiders (what he calls the ""invincible fallacy"").

For example, being that equal outcomes do not exist in nature (e.g. 10% of the world's species are in the Amazon rainforest, 90% of the world's tornadoes occur in the United States, lightning strikes more often in Africa than Europe and Asia combined) we should not expect otherwise in humans.

Here he articulates a reason other than systemic racism to explain income disparities:

&gt;Among the most overlooked factors in socioeconomic outcome differences is median age.  In the United States for example, income differences between middle aged people and young adults are larger than income differences between blacks and whites ... When the median age of Japanese Americans is 51 and the median age of Mexican Americans is 27, is it surprising if Hispanic Americans are not as well represented as Japanese Americans in occupations requiring long years of education and/or job experience?

He also uses this following turnover logic to dismantle a 2017 New York Times article that complained about how ""the favored fifth"" of Americans enjoy a disproportionate share of income.  According to Sowell they're actually referring to the *majority* since most Americans experience being in the top 20%.

&gt;Fewer than half of those Americans who were in the much-discussed ""top one percent"" in income in 1996 were still there in 2005.  Although people in that bracket have been referred to as ""the best-off one in one hundred,"" that is only true in a given instant.  Over the course of a lifetime the proportion of people in that bracket is one in nine, since 11 percent of Americans are in that bracket at some point in their lives.

And venting his frustration:

&gt;No matter how much empirical evidence is presented against the invincible fallacy, there is no corresponding burden of proof on the other side to present even a single example of the equal representation of various social groups in any given endeavor.  In what country, or in what kind of endeavor, or in what century out of the vast millennia of human history, has there ever been a proportional representation of various groups in any activity where people have been free to compete?

I'm also about halfway through Black Rednecks and White Liberals which is definitely interesting.  At the moment it seems like Sowell is arguing that blacks are held back mostly by their own ghetto culture and the welfare state and hardly by a legacy of slavery, for example citing how blacks from the caribbean and west indies continually progress despite also having experienced slavery.

Among many other things (e.g. reminding the reader that slavery was a global evil and not just whites enslaving blacks), he also pushes against the idea that slavery enabled the United States to experience great wealth, suggesting that the cost of the Civil War alone was far greater than the evil's net profit.

I'm surprised I haven't heard more about him.  His ideas obviously seem not politically correct but also rooted in facts.  Does anyone know of a good book that might give an opposite point of view?",books,3430
"I‚Äôve been getting into reading for the first time since I was a young teen(I‚Äôm 22 now) and I‚Äôm always worried I‚Äôm not retaining the information well enough. 

I‚Äôve been reading books that go over philosophy and psychology(sapiens and influence) and there‚Äôs so much that pops out as such good knowledge that I want to remember. However, I‚Äôm struggling with retaining it.

I take notes on my phone summarizing the chapter I read and highlight good quotes or sections I think would be worth rereading. I‚Äôll also try and mentally quiz myself a few days later to recap a chapter and sometimes I struggle to adequately reiterate everything.

Is this just the nature of reading, will some knowledge always slip through the cracks, or is it possible my memory just isn‚Äôt very good? 

How can I better retain and apply the knowledge I‚Äôm learning in books to my interactions in life? I‚Äôm kind of questioning on whether or not it‚Äôs just sort of a subconscious knowledge you‚Äôll carry with you that will pop out when something in your life triggers the need for it.",books,1052

"Hi all,

I hope you are all happy, safe &amp; healthy. Much love to you if you are struggling right now. You are good, important and this time shall pass. 

I apologise if this goes against the 'no recomendations' rule, I am looking for recommendations but also assistance with how to approach a broad topic. 

I run a tiny book club and our monthly meetings tend to be themed with the core objective being to educate ourselves on social issues and to improve our well being through reading. We recently hosted a 3 part series celebrating black authors in honour of BLM. 

Our next focus will be on mental health and reading as a means of escapism, healing and mindfulness. This is in response to many of us feeling depressed, anxious, isolated and generally 'not ourselves' thanks to COVID. Because we are currently hosting our meetings on zoom we have found it easier to each pick a book on the subject and to present it to the group. From there we discuss the issues and debate their wider ramifications. 

I am trying to think how we can best frame our next meeting and coming up a bit short. We don't necessarily want to read self help style books, we generally prefer fiction so I wanted to check in with you well read beauties to see if you had any suggestions for novels that you benefited from reading. Perhaps there was a character who experienced something close to your experiences and you were able to relate and find comfort as a result? Maybe the underlying philosophy of a certain novel helped you refrain your thinking and thus improved your mental health?

An example for me was Kitchen by Banana Yoshimoto. Essentially the story is of &gt;!a young woman who finds peace and comfort through cooking having experienced tragedy!&lt; . For me it put a new perspective on the process of mourning and  helped me take comfort from distraction rather than allow myself to feel guilt induced anxiety. I personally lost a loved one to COVID and desperatly had to find some sort of solace while being isolated from friends and family. It was and is still very hard. 

If anyone has any ideas on how we could  structure this meeting I would be very grateful. I put together a slideshow that we share on screen and try to order it as best I can so our topics and themes flow and don't get too convoluted. 

Thank you for taking the time to read and I look forward to hearing from you.

"I'm on part three of this book and I'm very much enjoying it so far, but there seems to be a discrepancy with dates that's irritating me.

"Man, what an epic adventure. This is one of those stories that is really impossible to capture in a short synopsis, as the unique way in which it is crafted paints a much more colorful picture than its premise suggests. It wasn‚Äôt until very late in the story that I began to see a clear picture of what was going on here, who was the protagonist and where all of the mind-bending perspective jumps were taking me as a reader. 

Early on I viewed Leland Stamper as the most interesting character, with his quest for vengeance against his older brother Hank driving him to return home and reestablish his identity. Throughout the book, however, Lee felt less and less justified in his shameless pursuit of Hank‚Äôs wife Viv, especially considering his willingness to revel in his perceived weak nature. 

By halfway through the book Hank emerged to me as the chief protagonist, whose virtue and sheer love of proving the townspeople wrong make him a compelling character among countless other details. I was heartbroken as I watched him lose one of his closest confidantes towards the end of the novel in a climactic and beautifully crafted passage. I am still somewhat confused as to what Hank did that was so damaging to Lee in the first place, but it is clear by this point that the only one harboring a grudge is Leland himself.

There really is so much to say about this book but I am interested in what others who may have read it think about the way it is written, the plot trajectory, the most interesting characters, and how Kesey‚Äôs epic novel maintains its unique position among 20th century American literature. I see this tale as almost Shakespearean with mythic elements that translate magnificently through the portrait of an Oregon logging family in the ‚Äò60s.

There's no doubt the conclusion that can be held from this book is that it is a timeless universal piece , something people will be reading for a long time.

"Decided to read Dostoevsky‚Äôs ‚ÄúCrime and Punishment‚Äù as a summer read. Within the first chapter the novel enthralled me and I ended up finishing it way quicker than I thought.

The book is by far one of the favorites I‚Äôve probably ever read, and seems so relevant to a modern reader. It was especially interesting to hear Dostoyevsky‚Äôs characterization of certain philosophies of his time, given the historical context.

I was captivated by how well it fits the themes of existential literature from the early 20th century while being from the mid 1800s. Raskolnikov‚Äôs inner monologue seems to parallel quite well those of ‚ÄúThe Stranger‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Metamorphosis‚Äù (especially The Stranger, seeing as how both involve a murder and ‚Äúreasons to go on living‚Äù). It seemed to me that C&amp;P could be a sort of grandfather to these types of characters and their inner narrative.

As I was reading the introduction by the translator (I always read the intros after finishing the book bc they often have spoilers), it said how the epilogue was polarizing. I personally loved the epilogue and saw it as a 2 chapter retelling of the entire story, or rather Raskolnikov‚Äôs journey.

I know it‚Äôs the common opinion that Anna was a bad person, but I sympathized with her the most. She was so blindly in love and repressed that she abandoned her child for a man and went insane.

I believe written in the mid-70's.  A tale of a tortured man refusing to believe in the world he's been thrust into.  A great tale of redemption and hope.  I pretty much think my entire reading life has been in search of another story that grips such as this one.

Anyone else read this series and have thoughts?",books,490

"So, I really REALLY wanna read this ""**how to win friends and influence people**"" ¬≠by *Dale carnegie* but I don't now SHIT about books, like does they even exist anymore. Not gonna lie, never ever finished a whole book without skipping some pages, but this time I'm going to do it.

So I heard about this legendary book that I found really interesting, but there are like a million editions and I don't know which one to get? Does it even mean anything? And can some one who have read the book tell me about their experience and maybe give me your advice for the best edition? (If it even matters)

"This is the first book I've ever read and thought ""this truly is a golden nugget."" People will have their opinions on Charles Bukowski but one thing we must all agree on is that he's damn fine with dialogue. From what I heard this book is more or less a loose fictional/nonfictional autobiography of his life, and what a story it is, I've never had such a fine time listening about kids doing every day things. He's not afraid to get dirty, he's not afraid to tell you something, and he definitely speaks his mind, something I think we lack a lot of today, people tiptoeing around conversations like they were landmines. Though its a fairly humorous book I don't think it's meant to be taken that way, he seems to have lived through a lot of hardships, mostly involving his abusive father, though he talks like that one weird uncle of yours that shows up at family gatherings so you can't help but not take him seriously. I even gave the audio book a listen and I'm not sure if its the author himself reading but I love that he sounds like he's completely sloshed while recording audio. Overall he's not perfect, he's a grumpy man with strong opinions, but I can't help but love him for it. I'm not sure if this is a popular book or author, but I thought I'd give my thoughts on this book and suggest it to anyone who hasn't read it. I'll leave you with one of my favorite quotes from the book.  

""You are thirty minutes late.""
""Yes.""
""Would you be thirty minutes late to a wedding or a funeral?""
""No.""
""Why not, pray tell?""
""Well, if the funeral was mine I'd have to be on time. If the wedding was mine it would be my funeral.""",books,1629

I tried downloading the audiobook to listen while driving or doing chores, I didn't allow myself to read anything else for WEEKS, but I kind of just ended up not reading at all. I have mad respect for Jordan's skill and creative mind, but I just couldn't get into the story. 

As I was getting through the portion of the book where Rand and Mat are just going from town to town trying to get to Caemlyn, I just completely lost interest. I couldn't help but feel like that entire section could have been edited down to a fourth of what it ultimately was.

"Just finished Steinbeck's *East of Eden* thanks to this sub's obsession with what I could easily place among the top three books I've ever read. I stumbled across this quote early on in the novel and was in awe of how accurately Steinbeck describes my precise feelings on the perceived nothingness of quarantine. We always hear that ""time flies when we're having fun,"" so why is that we perceive such eventless times so counterintuitively to this maxim? As Steinbeck so adroitly puts it:

 ‚ÄúTime interval is a strange and contradictory matter in the mind. It would be reasonable to suppose that a routine time or an eventless time would seem interminable. It should be so, but it is not. It is the dull eventless times that have no duration whatever. A time splashed with interest, wounded with tragedy, crevassed with joy - that's the time that seems long in the memory. And this is right when you think about it. Eventlessness has no posts to drape duration on. From nothing to nothing is no time at all.‚Äù

""No one ever had enough \[love\]. The stone orchard celebrates too little, not too much.""

"Setting up displays for new books, mostly oversized artbooks (12-15"" tall). Right now I'm using one pair of heavy duty bookstands to sandwich about 40 books together (approx. 4-5 feet worth of books)

They all somewhat rely on each other to stand up straight. I know that ideally I would want to lay them flat, but due to the number (40 is just one shelf) it's not possible. 

Is there any benefit to adding MORE bookstands to this row? Such as every 10-15 books (every 18-24 inches or so?) Or is that just unnecessary?

Hoping to prevent any issues from having just one long row pushed together if it creates any more stress on then.

"This is one of the reasons I can't use the library, I'm just too goddamn destructive with books. Over quarantine I've rekindled my love of reading, and I've noticed that the same entropic fate has befallen each copy.

A few weeks ago, I accidentally dropped my copy of Frederick Douglas's narrative into the creek where I read it. When I finally dried it off, the pages were coarse and waterlogged, and while it upset me at first, I soon realized it almost added something to those misery filled passages where he poured out his soul. Those ruined pages seemed to be stained with the tears of a brilliant man doomed to slavery. Suddenly, this pristine edition appeared much more appropriate to the story it was trying to tell. It felt raw and fractured, but still salvageable and beautiful, just like its author. Soon enough, I began to put myself into the shoes of Douglas himself. Reading it became an act of determination, as I strained my eyes to make out smudged words. For Douglas, a man who traded bread with urchins and studied letters painted on ship pieces to learn how to read, this certainly would have been nothing. 

So when I finished it, I found myself with something that felt incredibly intimate. It was like a signature Douglas made 140 years after his death. And every time I look at it, I'll remember the creekside convention in Pendleton, Indiana where he signed it. 

I could go on this way about every book I've ever completed. Whether it's the coffee stains from a sleepy afternoon or the spaghetti sauce of a meal eaten over a story I just couldn't tear myself away from, the markings of my books are like a visual diary. They tell me what I was thinking, the places I brought it, where I stopped and started, express my frustration and my delight.

Of course you can't do these things intentionally, otherwise they aren't honest accounts. But as long as you don't have anyone to return it to, there's something to be said about giving your book a little beating.",books,1989
"I was never been hooked by a book until now. The ending? Fucking *Amazing*. Not just the plot ending but the actual ""last word"". The plot twists? MADE FRICKIN SENSE. Flynn did an amazing job. All the small intricacies. I loved how the parts that made me feel uneasy at the beginning (just to be fixed up later with the twists and such) were made to make me feel that way. It was also the first time I felt scared when i was reading at night. 

The characters? love them. I understood them. *Really* understood them. And as a teen girl who has never been to america, i felt like i was in the actual town of the story.

"Before we start, i am subjective. i have been reading Atonement by Ian Mcewan. Book is 603 pages, currently i am on 433, which is the end of second part. ( i am saying this because i don't know if it's same in different editions). Anyway, what was that whole second part ? i almost skipped several pages, but then i was just encouraging myself that it might have been part of the plot and it was necessary but oh boy. First part was decent, intriguing, thrilling, second part started well too. turner and corporals . typical days of WW2. But as i was reading, gradually realized that it was one of the most boring books i have ever read. These details were so unnecessary. i didn't really get what was the purpose of it? i just read it and i can tell i don't even remember a thing about this whole war journey except him getting wounded, meeting with 2 french families and thoughts about cecille . and it's funny because this journey took almost 200 pages. and these 200 pages were the boring ones. i am really hoping that last part will be great. because as i have read some reviews in goodreads, people say that even though start is dull, it is getting better and better and i really want the ending to be worth. 

P.S i am not really hating on this book. just my opinion, i like big books, but in this scenario and plot, that whole war journey was so unnecessary, maybe some words, maybe little bit of description, but not this one hell of a ww2 history in a novel, where in a first part, i practically associated myself and my thoughts with a little girl.",books,1559
"Wow. Just wow. I've grown up watching the movies because my dad is a HUGE Tolkien nerd (translated Sindarin on his own lol). He read me The Hobbit when I was little, and I read the Silmarillion a while back on his recommendation. But until now, I'd never read the actual trilogy because I thought the movies were good enough.

I was so, so wrong. I finished the last chapter at 2am last night after a 6 month journey through the amazing world that Tolkien has crafted. In that time, the world has fallen apart, I was broken up with, left college, and I've been searching for where I want my life to go from here. Perhaps it's the fact that my own journey has been so hard during this time that the books hit me with such enormous emotional power, but I feel as though the world has been changed. Last night, as I said goodbye to the characters and world, I found myself crying. So much of their journey has been my own in these last 6 months, and I could never describe the joy and sorrow I felt as I turned those last pages.

There is an element of safety in fantasy, since you know it isn't real. But for me, the journey has not quite ended, and it is real. This trilogy has given me faith in a happy end, however. And I can thank Master Samwise for that. ""It‚Äôs like in the great stories Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered. Full of darkness and danger they were, and sometimes you didn‚Äôt want to know the end. Because how could the end be happy. How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad happened. But in the end, it‚Äôs only a passing thing, this shadow. Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer.""",books,1684

"I first read King Coal and after through strong recommendation of a friend read The Jungle which I thought was just as good. So when I saw he made a book (Brass Check) about his real account of the world of journalism, I thought it would be behind scenes of his past works. He did discuss his work behind King Coal and The Jungle but only through lens of how other journalists didn't care much for his work.

This whole book felt like political Youtuber's response to another Youtuber who had beef with them. I mean that in sense that it was overly long to hammer in the same point and barely put his own account/ argument under scrutiny. By page 100 i would quit reading if wasn't for his behind scene accounts of oil tycoons and small celebrity figures abused by media.

"This is just a thought I have sometimes, I've tried to make it as coherent as possible. 

We all know stories influence us, but how deep does it actually go? 

I don't mean how we all read The Chronicles of Narnia and think closets are secretly magical, but say a teenager read something intended for adults and it actually contributed to their personality and the life they ended up living. 

For example, I read Wild Swans by Jung Chang when I was 12 (and didn't understand half of it), and had read East of Eden and One Hundred Years of Solitude by age 14. I was exposed to this kind of literature because my dad read them and I just picked up what was in his library. 

As I get older I look back and realise how deeply some of the messages in these stories impacted me, influencing my values and beliefs, particularly around poverty, equality, war, and general humanity. I have a habit of viewing the world in a kind of philosophical way, wondering what things mean and the threads that connect us all, things like that, when I don't have any actual interest in the study of philosophy. But it reminds me of how Steinbeck writes, and I wonder if the profound ideas in his work have bled out into my view of reality. I feel somewhat disconnected with most other people because they don't seem to view the world this way. Neither way is right or wrong, it's just my experience, and I wonder if being exposed to such heavy concepts in the form of an engaging novel at a young age has contributed a lot to who I am today. I wonder if I'd still be like this if I had been reading YA at 14 instead. 

In practical terms I went on to get a degree in Chinese history and language, and 20th C China is my focus (which is what Wild Swans is about).

"i pulled ""The Sound and The Fury' by William Faulkner off the bookshelf, and decided to revisit it after over 30 years. i blew off the dust, got my cup of hot tea, sat down and started reading. i after about 40 pages in, i threw it into the corner, disgusted.

"I just got done reading ""Fish in a Tree"" by Linda Mullaly Hunt, and I wanted to tell you four or five reasons why I think this is a great book for pre-teens, especially kids who are at the age where they are starting to understand the role of symbolism and the act of deriving meaning from events and language.  I promise I won't lace this with spoilers. 

1. The first reason is that it's about a person with a disability in learning, but I like how the writer doesn't pigeonhole this character into her disability. Rather, she elevates her ""quirk"" into something that is just different, the way someone would dress, or the way someone would speak. She does a good job of using this difference as a leveller of the playing field, in interesting ways. 
2. The writer plays around with the age old trope of bullies and social cliques, but she's very subtle about it and I love the way she gives each clique their unique identity, while sussing out the leaders of said cliques and their tragic flaws. 
3. The book really plays heavily with symbolism and how things carry meaning that we give them and that others give them. I like how she plays around with how there are differences in how we give meaning to things as opposed to how others do, and I especially like how there are several scenes where adults try to figure out how smart a kid is by playing around with the use of symbols. The main character is also particularly adept at reading symbols, but what makes the narrative special is that she doesn't know that she is, because nobody has any dialogue with her about it. Eventually, she learns she is good at it, and then teaches others. 
4. And finally, I think, it really does help the reader get inside the head of the main character and see how a learning disability is actually a very unique way to see the world and people. 

Strongly recommend this to teachers and to anyone who has kids. Shoot, even if you don't have kids, the book is decently written and you could probably pound it out in a week and learn something from it.",books,2043
"Yo, r/books:

Last week, a post about methods, pros, and cons of ditching Goodreads got pretty big and generated quite a bit of discussion.

Those of you who are somewhat familiar with my past remarks on this sub know I have no love for Amazon or Goodreads, so naturally I commented about my having ditched Goodreads for some time now.

I happened to mention that I have been using an excel spreadsheet to track my book collection and reading habits, and I offered to share it with anyone that was interested. A lot of you reached out to request a copy of the sheet. The sheer amount of folks that messaged me made me realize that perhaps there might be more people out there interested in tracking their collections and reading habits this way, so I decided to share with all of r/books my spreadsheet.

Screenshots of the spreadsheet are available on [imgur](https://imgur.com/gallery/WbLcwzG). 

On it, you'll find **five** tabs.

* A **Collection** tab, to annotate the books you own and which of those books have been Read, Unread, or Unfinished.
* A **Currently Reading** tab, to annotate your current reads and progress.
* A **Read List** tab, which allows the user to annotate what they've read on what dates and tracks how many books the user has read in a given calendar year.
* A **TBR** tab, to record books you wish to read.
* And an **Additional Stats** tab, that records how much of your collection is from what time frame (centuries, decades, etc.), the gender ratio of your collection, the total pages your collection contains, and the percentage of your collection's genres.

This is a sheet I took some time to generate tonight based on my own with a few extra upgrades. My personal sheet for my collection only has a **Collection** Tab and **Read List** tab; I'm not that interested in the others, but I figured to adequately replace all of Goodreads features, other folks might want those other ""bells and whistles"".

If you're interested in getting a copy of the sheet, let me know, and I'll send you the link.",books,2032

"Lately, I've started to slowly get over my aversion to annotate, and I'm currently using post-its on books I read to annotate, but I'm itching to start highlighting or writing in the books because I could still get another copy if I got annoyed by it after a bit, you know.

But I was wondering, what if I want to get rid of a book I've annotated with highlighters and pens? Do you guys have some experience if people are actually interested in buying used and annotated copies?",books,478
"For a couple years now, whenever I want to read a book, I buy the physical copy and the audiobook and the listen to the audiobook while I read the physical book. It has helped me finish so many books at such a faster rate, and I‚Äôve really enjoyed it. But, for some reason, I can‚Äôt help but feel guilty about it. Like, even though it really helps me out a lot because I have ADHD and I tend to get distracted often, I just feel like I‚Äôm not getting the full experience of the book. It‚Äôs almost like I have a fear of missing out on how my imagination would‚Äôve interpreted the story. Does that make sense? For example, what if the narrator of the audiobook voices a character in the book that I would‚Äôve given a different voice to in my head? I don‚Äôt know, I might sound crazy. I just sometimes wonder what I would have done if I lived before audiobooks were invented. 

For instance, when I started reading *the Shadow of the Wind* by Carlos Ruiz Zaf√≥n, it was the first book in a while that I had tried to read without listening to the audio and I got pretty far into it (about 150 pages). But then, for some reason, I put the book down for a few months. It wasn‚Äôt until this past weekend that I bought the audiobook, and then picked the book back up. I ended up finishing the whole entire book in two days and I had a blast reading it. So, I don‚Äôt know, I need someone‚Äôs opinion. I feel like the way I read is better than just listening to an audiobook by itself and not following along right? Somebody help me out so I can just keep reading lol.

(TL;DR
Is it cheating to read while listening to the audio of the book that I‚Äôm reading?)",books,1637

‚ÄúHere‚Äôs the thing about an apple: it sticks in the throat. It‚Äôs a package deal: lust and understanding. Immortality and death. Sweet pulp with cyanide seeds.

Anyway the couple starts having mysterious shit happen to them. Their gas goes missing so the husband has to hike into town to get more.

"I'd been in a reading slump for like ever since this year began until recently while cleaning when I found this fairy tale book I have as a kid but never really touched since. It's a fairy tale book which has a story for literally every day of the year so I decided to read on this month's tales just because. 
I probably read these as a kid like ""uh-huh cool, nice story"" but now that I'm entering adulthood, these are like whole new stories with depth which I guess I just didn't notice then but is really there. One might even say children's books aren't just for children and I couldn't agree more!",books,602
"I have enjoyed reading since my early childhood, and read for an hour almost every day. I'm thinking of getting an ebook, but I am not sure. I like feeling paper books - their smell and having them on my shelves. I also like them with pretty covers. So, I adore the experience of reading a real book. However, lately, it has been hard to find the books that I wanna read in my country, and new books are either very pricy or don't even come here. So what do you recommend? Should I get an ebook(just a basic one) or keep reading paperwhite books?",books,546
"This book is really controversial and revolves around a dark and heartbreaking topic. The author received a lot of backlash as well as anyone who said that they love the book. Apart from how the book is well written, I think morally what matters the most is if the book glorifies that behavior, is neutral about it or is against it? I don't know how that book dealt with that issue but if the author made it clear that this behavior is disgusting then the book isn't morally bad because it is showing how sick this is, we can hate it or go against it if it doesn't show that. What do you think?",books,594

Before the killing, Raskolnikov believes that with the money he could liberate himself from poverty and go on to perform great deeds. However, once it is done he finds himself racked with confusion, paranoia, and disgust for what he has done. His justifications disintegrate completely as he struggles with guilt and horror and confronts the real-world consequences of his deed.",books,775
"Hey! So, I finished reading *We* and I have a few thoughts.

Firstly, I feel the writing was a bit disjointed. I don't know if that was intentional, or maybe a case of key details getting lost in translation? 

I liked how it explored the themes of the collective vs the individual, freedom vs happiness, etc. I find it interesting how Zamyatin draws parallels between blind faith in an ideology or state and religious zealotry. 

It really explored the concept of social engineering and its faults. How not all aspects of the human condition can be accounted for through biochemical or environmental factors. 

It was very hard to keep up with the plot. It was pretty fast paced, which I liked. I know this is a really dumb thing to say, but the names! D-350, etc. It really confused me. I understand the point though, because it made the characters feel less like people, individuals. If that makes sense. 

I liked the c oncept so I think I'm going to read Huxley's *Brave New World* after this to see what his take on a utilitarian uhhh...utopia? is. 

Anyways, what do you guys think?",books,1089
"Sorry if this isn't the right place -

With online shopping, particularly Amazon, it seems that larger sizes books get pretty beaten up in transit. I've bought 3-4 of the same book, all with the same results. 

Typically, it's crunched corners, bent edges, dusty cloth covers, or wrinkled dust jackets. 

Is there an easy way to repair these? Or are they ""done for"" if they take a hit?

I've tried ""rolling out"" some of the dents on hardcover books and they do look a LITTLE better, but definitely still look ""damaged""

Is there any (easy and visibly good) way of doing this?

"Am sorting through my bookshelves and I found that quite a number of my books have brown spots all over (not just on the sides, but in the interior pages too). Initially assumed mould growth, but looking through images on the internet, I realise they might be foxing instead. However, the images I see online aren't as severe and blotchy as mine. 

Is this mould or foxing? In either case, would it spread to other books and are these books safe to keep?

I've placed all the books in a small room with a dehumidifier to 'dry' out the pages for a couple of days, hoping this might solve the problem.

"Hello! I'm rather new to this subreddit, so I apologize if this has been asked before. 

So I just finished the Matched trilogy, by Ally Condie, today (I read the first book years ago, accidentally bought the 3rd book and read a spoiler, and decided to wait a few years until I forgot the spoiler). I know it's not the best example of a love triangle, considering it was pretty obvious who Cassia would end up with, but it got me thinking nonetheless. 

I can't remember if I've ever actually heard someone say they enjoy love triangles. I feel like it is/has become a rather unpopular opinion to enjoy them. I almost feel embarrassed for saying that I really like a good love triangle in a book. Of course when a love triangle is written poorly it sucks, but the same can be said for any trope.

  A 27 years old fat and horribly lazy person, without work and without the attitude of looking for one, unable to accept the reality of his environment with cheap excuses of all kinds while blaming other for everything, telling myself that I would not be able to have a normal life like my father or my mother or friends do, saying that I'd rather kill myself than having to get up early and have to work every day on a normal job, while my mother works full time and has barely enough to pay the rent ans still takes care of me while I all I do is pretend that I write while I spend the day watching youtube, masturbating and eating junk food, as well as just hating all series, movies and books that I consume to entertain myself. Just as I hate everything that is ""popular"" and of the masses for automatically appearing stupid to me.

  I'm really scared to have seen myself reflected in something as monstrous as this. Is this some kind of mental illness or is it more common than I'd think? I feel dizzy every time I think about it and I feel incredibly unhappy to see that I am not able to change it.

I had her reserve it for me and she picked it up next time she went.  I knew nothing about it before I started reading it.  My god did I love this book!  Such an eerie wonderful story!  The was he writes is so deceptively simple, or economical rather.  Every word has purpose and nothing is wasted. Plus the story is so original and exactly the type of fiction I love.  Just a bit of sci fi grounded heavily in reality and very thoughtfully written.  There is so much to say and yet I don‚Äôt want to give anything at all away, I just want more people to read this book!

Which is all the more impressive for me considering I have two toddlers running around all day too!  I immediately wanted to start re reading it too because I feel like it was so subtle that even as I was reading I could tell I was missing small details just due to the fact that it was so mysterious and I didn‚Äôt know which details mattered yet.

"I‚Äôm currently an university student, and while deeply interested in literature, I wasn‚Äôt able to take a class on it this semester. I have read a bit about literary theory, however I‚Äôm pretty ignorant about the actual process of analyzing literature. I wanted to pick a couple of books and read them alongside any work of criticism/analysis I could find about them, but it feels too unfocused and sort of pointless.

I was wondering whether there‚Äôs a book similar to what an university course covering a couple of selected works would be. I watched some of the lectures in The American Novel Since 1945 from Yale, but there‚Äôs only so much you can cover in a hour-long video (and I was expecting for a more ‚Äòtextual‚Äô analysis, although I still liked the lectures). Therefore, I‚Äôm looking for something similar in structure, so I can read a novel and then easily find analysis about it. I‚Äôd like to know whether any such book exists at all.

" Personally , from the moment i started reading the book it encouraged me to keep reading and to also create the feeling of suspense through almost all the plot. The form of how the author decided to create the stories and form a relationship with the characters was in a very unique manner that made me enjoy more the book. 

In my opinion normally books that approach WW2 issues are more of a documentary kind or a very cliche story. Taking more in account the story i was suprised by the plot twist that nathan sister was alive, and when greta makes leo a man are like the biggest wtf, becasue nathan was surely not leaving without here sister, and leo was like super happy but also scared if they got caught, not everyone can say the fucked the wife of the man who is in charge.

I started with this one as I heard it was a good place to start but have since read otherwise.

I liked his writing with the exception of the dialogue - I'm not sure exactly how to describe it but it feels very 'commercial', flat and generic. It's evident very early - see Tetsuya in the diner, and then Kauro who essentially sounds the same as him. It's like everyone is an overconfident 20 year old man, which is very different from what Kauro for example is and is described as looking like.

"So I have read two Swedish books. Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and Let The Right One In (Let Me In) Both were very graphic about rape, child pedophilia especially for young boys and sex. Why is that? Is it a cultural thing or is it just bad sample size on the books I have read.   


I read Let The Right One In, and there was so much child pedophilia and rape and unnecessary additions of graphic sexual imagery that it really turned me off the book. Like at one point they notice a vampire is coming back to life by looking at his erect penis. It seems like it was added in for every chapter. Is that common for Swedish books? Is it just that I chose two books that had more of this? Is it something else?

"I know this isn't the first time this book has been brought up in this sub, but I just wanted to add my 2 cents just because of how impactful this book was to me. 

The biggest and most obvious attraction to the book was the sense of adventure. Living as cowboys during that time must have been a mix of the highest highs and the lowest lows. Emotional rollercoasters are part of the job and I guess you truly feel....alive? 

Then there are the things that pop up in between trying your hardest to survive. Friendship, leadership, love, purpose of life, death.  

Then the cherry on top of the book is it's actually really funny! There were several times where I actually physically laughed, which is pretty rare. One of the heroes of the book is famed Texas Ranger Augustus McCrae. One of his biggest personality traits was his humor and it truly shows you the authors gift in bringing that personality to life. His partner and fellow Texas ranger, Captain Call is the polar opposite, which also takes great writing to pull off.

Now coming to the reason why I began writing this post. Just yesterday on my ebook reader I found out that I could turn on the read out loud option and my ebook sort off becomes a audiobook narrating me the book . I can set the pace and pitch of the voice .
I thought it would be difficult to follow the narrative as I'm alien to audiobooks.

 I now slowly began doing something which I'm so fond of now... I hit the readout loud option on my ebook reader listen to narration and follow/read the text at the same time. Even if I loose track of the reading or gets my hands busy I still keep listening to narration and follow the plot . I even go to the extent of having the paperback in front of me and listen to the narrative on my ebook reader and follow the same text on my book.

"A few days ago I picked up The Wind in the Willows for the first time, and it was mesmerizing. With the pandemic and all that related stress, it was so nice to read a calm book with low stakes. The characters like each other and do their best to help each other out of various scrapes. 

There are a lot of fireside chats in this novel, and that‚Äôs exactly what the book felt like - as if Kenneth Grahame pulled up a chair for me, gave me a cup of tea, and started telling me about Toad‚Äôs car, Mole‚Äôs spring cleaning, Rat‚Äôs boat and Badger‚Äôs home in the Wild Woods. 

I know a lot of people like the seventh chapter ‚ÄúThe Piper at the Gates of Dawn,‚Äù but nothing can top the first chapter for me. Mole is thrilled at discovering life along the river, and his happiness is so infectious. Here's an example:

&gt;‚ÄúThe Mole waggled his toes from sheer happiness, spread his chest with a sigh of contentment, and leaned back blissfully into the soft cushions. ‚ÄúWhat a day I‚Äôm having!‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúLet us start at once!‚Äù

If you give it a read, I highly recommend the unabridged version with illustrations by Ernest H. Shepard. The illustrations are straight-up cute and seeing these animals armed with tiny sticks and swords and pistols is inherently adorable. 

I read it on my own, but it would be a great book to read aloud. Some of the descriptions - especially of the riverside in the summer - make me nostalgic for memories I‚Äôve never had. You just feel like you could stretch out and join a picnic.

I was able to pick up on all I needed to relatively quickly, but I was confused at first. All the characters felt real and I liked the ones I was supposed and hated the ones I was supposed to.

"So, I‚Äôve been reading a bunch of Asimov books in ‚Äúorder‚Äù of events, not order of publication, according to [this guide](http://kaedrin.com/fun/asimov/aguide.html), and I absolutely loved the robot books (the I, Robot short stories, and all the Elijah Baley futuro-noir novels), but it feels like a pretty big step down in enjoyment (for me) going from those to the ‚ÄúEmpire‚Äù series books.

Most notably, as I mentioned in my title, I just finished The Stars, Like Dust, and I *literally* rolled my eyes in bed and dropped by phone away from my face when I got to the very end. &gt;!For those who don‚Äôt remember, there‚Äôs this sub-plot about an important document from Earth that‚Äôs the ‚Äúgreatest weapon‚Äù and will aid the rebellion, and it‚Äôs of the most importance . . . And it‚Äôs the U.S. Constitution.!&lt; Now, I can understand‚Äîlooking back at U.S. History, why Asimov may have made that choice. &gt;!The book was published in 1951, and McCarthy‚Äôs reign of anti-communist terror had just begun the year before, so Asimov‚Äîwith a decidedly Russian-sounding name‚Äîmay have well concluded the book to establish his patriotism.!&lt; But it feels so out of place and I was so disappointed that, instead of relishing the book and rushing to my Libby app to rent the next book in the series, like I‚Äôd done up to this point, I feel deflated, like I‚Äôve already read the best of what the series has to offer, and I‚Äôll only be disappointed from here out.

That said, I did read Foundation first‚Äîout of order, before I realized there were so many books to read leading up to it‚Äîand I liked it, so of course I‚Äôm going to keep reading (what else should I do in the wee hours of the morning when I can‚Äôt sleep?), but I just wondered if anyone else felt the same way.

Really, I‚Äôd love to hear from anyone who read Asimov back in the 1950s when these books were being published. Did they strike you as inspiring, patriotic, appropriate in the face of the red scare? Or was there eye rolling, even back then, as young sci-fi readers finished the last page of The Stars, Like Dust?

Was there criticism of this book for its ending, either then or now? Or praise? Maybe it‚Äôs just the time we‚Äôre in now, but it feels weird to think someone like Asimov, who seems so interested in the different kinds of worlds that could flourish or perish, in the kinds of things that make being alive worth fighting for, that an intellectual like Asimov could end‚Äîunironically and without satire, as far as I could tell‚Äîa book the way he did. But maybe that‚Äôs just because the world was so different back then? 

Final note: for those who haven‚Äôt read any Asmiov, I won‚Äôt necessarily recommend the ‚Äúchronology‚Äù guide I linked above‚ÄîI actually kind of wish I had read the books in publication order, just to get a better sense of how his writing and his worldview changed‚Äîbut I *strongly* recommend reading the books in the robot series if you like detective stories, robots, or both.",books,2944

"I‚Äôm about 60% through Blood Meridian by Cormac McCarthy and, while I enjoy parts of it, this has easily been one of the most challenging books I‚Äôve read as an adult. 

I should love this book. I love westerns and I typically love long-winded prose with challenging vocabulary, but Blood Meridian is just something else. 

My biggest problem a little more than halfway through is the characters. I get that they‚Äôre all pretty terrible people, and the unhinged violence is basically the point of the book, but I wish there was at least a little more characterization. The only character who intrigues me is the Judge, because he at least has some depth and seems interesting even though he is a terrible person.

The Kid, who I thought was basically the protagonist, is barely mentioned in the 2nd quarter of the book except for here or there. Toadvine does nothing for me. Glanton is a piece of shit. 

I‚Äôm at the point right now where they got into a fight at a funeral and ended up shooting the whole town, now they‚Äôre riding into town after town on a rampage. 

I just feel like I‚Äôm missing something with this book. It‚Äôs so highly beloved it seems and I can‚Äôt fully understand why. The description is very nice, I respect that the plot is basically ‚Äúthere is no plot‚Äù, but the characterization is just tough for me. 

I only read one other McCarthy book before this and it was ‚ÄúThe Road‚Äù, which I enjoyed. It did have that same sense of nihilism but I found the father and the boy to be a bit more compelling. 

Am I missing something with Blood Meridian? Am I not understanding? I would ask if it changes, but I‚Äôve read enough to know that when you‚Äôre more than halfway through a book, what you see is what you get the rest of the way.",books,1739
"How did you like the book and what was your perception of its main character, the tone of his voice, the way he portrays his life and experiences? Any particular observations on the narrative style? What impression or effect did it leave on you after you finished it?
I personally realized, most likely due to certain strong negative associations, that a book doesn‚Äôt have to automatically be your best friend but rather a faithful company. I wouldn‚Äôt like to devalue the perspective aspect which is undoubtedly unique portraying a peculiar personality and the way he perceives the reality and the life but the further I advanced while reading it, the more sick I felt looking through the eyes of the protagonist. That dry zombie-like tone who is on the hunt to satisfy not more than his animalistic needs felt extremely draining to me. I cannot recall that I had come across through such an emotionless half-dead narrative style.
Therefore I wonder what impact it made on the others- those of you who also read it.
Being an MBTI enthusiast, I of course would be interested to know your MBTI personality type, if possible, in order to get a better understanding on people‚Äôs overall perceptions vs. my personal one and how the reactions would vary according to their type.

"I'm not sure if this is allowed here, but since it's book related information which makes me really happy, I wanted to let you know. 

The game should not be 1:1 adaptation of the book, but is inspired by Kafka's Metamorphosis AND other books, like Trial. I think it's nice that someone's is trying to bring the book and video-gaming culture together since I'm very interested in both. 

I think it's also great opportunity for parents with kids struggling with their school reading assignments (which contain Kafka's books, at least in my country) and might be interesting experience, potentially sparking interest in literature for those who don't want to read, but are naturaly close to video games these days (like in case of Poland and their This War of Mine game being implemented as school assignment).

"Hi guys, so myself and a few friends have decided to open up our very small Bookclub to others. The genres we will be reading will be centered particularly around dark romance, taboo themes etc (you see where it‚Äôs going üòú). We wanted to hear and discuss our different opinions and diversify up dialogues ranging from female s*xuality within the Islamic context and perspective and as well as how those factors contribute to our thinking and practices as Muslim women . If anyone is interested we would gladly be happy to accept.  We also want to emphasise that this is a very open safe space for everyone to add their two cents in (21+ females Only)",books,649
"During my summer holiday I started reading more. I used to never read. Now I read around 20 pages per day of non-fiction (probably not a lot, but still good progress for me). 

I was noticing that I wasn‚Äôt really remembering a lot of what I read. So I looked up some techniques to better memorisation. However, now when I read, I feel like I have to remember it and I can‚Äôt read the book in a relaxed state. I am constantly trying to remember, even though I am conscious of the fact that it won‚Äôt really help (during the actual reading).

Any advice is welcome! :)",books,564

I wasn't able to finish the leavers by Lisa ko or trust exercise by Susan choi. Then I picked up ask again, yes and the same thing happened. I am not sure if it is because the fiction books I've picked were all kinda depressing. I use to love fiction so much. Any recommendations to help me get out of this rut?",books,611
"I became a regular reader less than three years ago; my entertainment background is mostly of games and movies. And while movie ratings on IMDB can play a major role in deciding whether or not that movie is good, book ratings on Goodreads are the most random ratings I have ever seen. They are almost always 4 stars +- 0.4, and that small fraction isn't even consistent with the book's quality. Reading written reviews (especially once you begin following a few reviewers) can be helpful, but the overall ratings are not. Not in any way.

Examples of this would be  reflective books by the likes of Gabriel Garcia Marquez or basically any classic (the former also being one). 

Are their any specific websites where I can read these analyses?",books,369

I‚Äôm new to this sub, so I‚Äôm not totally sure how the format works here. My friend recommended me the author, Mishima, I did some research and he had a very interesting history and a rather sad ending. Essentially, has anyone read his books? I was thinking of buying ‚ÄòConfession of a Mask‚Äô as I think it looks quite interesting.

"This is based on personal experiences I had from reading secondhand books. Some of the books used are my own with their own inscriptions made by other people.

The photos shown in the video are photos that were actually found in secondhand books. No one knows who they are or how their photos ended up there, it is one of those things that randomly make you feel sad. It happened to me a few times, and instead of keeping the photo, I strangely put them back in.

"Months ago, I went into a used bookstore and tried to search for books that I had on my Goodreads to-read list and I ended up buying Beartown by Fredrik Backman. 

The premise of the book wasn't one that appealed to me necessarily because I'm not a huge sports person, much less a hockey fan, but Backman's themes of community, diversity, and courage really resonated with me. Usually, I'm a little hesitant on books told from multiple perspectives because it can be hard for the reader to connect with individual characters, but the way Backman wrote Beartown was so engaging it was hard for me to pick a favorite character out of the main cast. Every character had a different, unique perspective to contribute to the storyline and the growth that each character went through in the face of conflict was profound. 10/10; one of my favorite stand alone novels (the sequel was just as inspiring)

Then, I read A Man Called Ove and it had the such beautiful prose I still think about certain descriptions sometimes. Without spoiling anything specific, I just fell in love with the way Backman would describe characters with so much color and depth that you could almost understand the full weight of a relationship within a single paragraph. This novel was both heartbreaking and touching with similar themes of community and unity. Also, Ove just reminds me of Carl from ""Up"" and while he was a more unconventional protagonist, his character development was flawless.

Basically, every time I read a Fredrik Backman novel, I just feel like curling up under fluffy blankets with a cup of cocoa while it snows outside (despite it being summer atm and coming from an area where it has never snowed naturally lol). Also, with everything going on in the world right now, a feel good novel is exactly the kind of positive energy I want in my life.",books,1841

-Laura Vanderkam, ‚Äú168 Hours‚Äù

This is the closest that I will (admit to) read(ing) a self-help book. It (as far as I can tell) talks about how there are 168 hours in the week that represent a repeating pattern in our lives, and if we can tweak it, we can take full advantage of the time and be more successful in our careers and, more importantly, our lives. This is my first book to read after a marathon of Jon Krakauer books, and it‚Äôs refreshing to put the focus on ME!

Of course, this book was written in 2010, 10 years before our acting president has chosen to restrict voting rights to people (I doubt he‚Äôs even read the 1965 Voting Rights Act). But if we can learn a thing or two from this (one, very tiny quote of a book that I haven‚Äôt yet read in its entirety), it‚Äôs that we NEED TO VOTE and that we NEED TO READ MORE TO OUR CHILDREN. Also, we really need to just READ!!  Walk into your local coffee shop and pick up a poetry book. Allow yourself that 3 minutes it takes to read, comprehend, and digest that poem. Grab a collection of short stories at the local bookstore and allow yourself to take your time and work through it, no matter how long it takes. 

I‚Äôve always been a slow reader. I remember I ‚Äúpretended‚Äù to read through so many class exercises in school. I would read the words, but fail to comprehend them. I still do this. I‚Äôll find myself 3 pages into a chapter and recognize that I have NO IDEA what is going on. It‚Äôs a constant struggle, as I am easily distracted and a natural day-dreamer. 

BUT, since I‚Äôve been tasking myself to get through books the last 5 months, my life has felt more complete.  Yes, I read articles I see on Facebook or Reddit. I read those.

Hofstadter believes that American education is too indifferent to ‚Äòrational thinking‚Äô and places too much emphasis on the ""practicality"" of education. 

But when Tocqueville commented on the American ""philosophy"" at the time, he praised this instead, because Americans can be said to be ""the country that studies Descartes the least but practices best, because they always ""solve practical problems and think for purpose"".

I typically end up inserting myself into a book while reading. I envision myself alongside a particular protagonist and I end up feeling as though I can feel them very deeply. So this was a very different reading perspective. It was like watching as a shadow at all of the many different stories being told. I felt absorbed by the history within the words.

I found myself unable to put it down at times. Parts of it are a little far fetched, which to me was a turn off at first, but I got over it and enjoyed the book. I think it does a good job representing the balance between good and evil. Adding to that, I think he did a good job portraying how society would be forced to build itself back up if something that severe were to happen. It was also the first King novel I've read.

You may or may not agree with Ayn Rand‚Äôs politics; however, as I read this book for the second time since my youth I‚Äôm finding this book a revelation about authenticity.  I didn‚Äôt appreciate it as powerfully on the first time around in high school.  Perhaps my motivations were different then.  While I‚Äôm sure I appreciated the stark differences between James Keating and Howard Roark, as I read this as a grown man with children I can‚Äôt help but think how clairvoyant Rand is about the common man.  The pursuit of perfectionism as an outward, false pursuit in the form of Keating searching for outward approval contrasted against Roark‚Äôs search within himself for truth.

After some research, the reason seems to be the fact that, over time the weight of the pages causes them to separate from the spine (since this is a bigger book). Any advice on what to do and how to prevent this from happening in the future?

I always read the first, middle, and last pages of a book to get the gist, but recently I‚Äôve been considering looking at the whole thing. Perhaps I could get a better understanding of literature!
My suspicions began when I read Harry Potter, and didn‚Äôt have a clue who any of the characters were and what the hell was going on. I continued to doubt this after using the method on my textbooks and promptly failing my exams.

"I feel like I'm missing something... There has to be more than the obvious truth vs happiness/freedom vs. comfort thing... But the ending just blindsided me. I don't understand how self-denial/self-inflicted pain = clarity.  


The horrible repetitive dialogue-- I get that he's trying to create an effect, but I feel like the book was short out of necessity because it was so simplistic? Maybe the emergence of industrialization, the immediate threat of totalitarianism made it very pertinent at the time...  


I don't know... I want to like it, but it wasn't an enjoyable read- or even particularly insightful. And I like other books of the genre, like 1984. That was waaay more engrossing. And I like other books of Huxley's- such as Point Counter Point, Crome Yellow, The Genius and the Goddess, The Devils of Loudun, etc.   


To me, this wasn't his best, most interesting, or insightful writing... Far from it. I feel like its popularity is maybe because of its shock value? Him being an already well-known figure and then writing about child sexual play and blood orgies and suicide, etc. But maybe it was just more cutting edge at the time? It does have an unusual kaleidoscopic writing style at times... I don't know.

1. The Harry Potter collection

2. Dan Brown - Angels and Demons, Da Vinci code, Digital Fortress and Deception Point.

"Hi All!

For some years now I‚Äôve been trying to find a book from the 1980s that I loved as a child but to no avail. 

Any chance that the mighty Reddit can help hunt it down for me?

So. The book.

It was called ‚ÄúAnimals of the World‚Äù, it was a large hardback in bottle green with gold text on the spine. I think (but may be wrong) it was published by Orbis. The dust jacket was cream coloured and I have a funny feeling there was a koala among other animals on the cover.

I would imagine it was published in the late 80s but may have been the very early 1990s. Nothing that fits appears in any google or eBay searches but copies have to be out there somewhere.

Any help you can give would be amazing.",books,703
"I just finished a light romcom book, called ""To the Stars and Back"" by Camilla Isley.  The novel stars a woman engineer (in rocket science), and it's written by a woman engineer.  And -- I'm a woman engineer (worked in aerospace too!). 

It's just so refreshing to read books from perspectives that are similar to mine. I'd wager that most people consume media that represent their demographics, but when you come from a minority category, that's hard.  I've read so many ridiculous books about writers or budding writers yet not very many about STEM people, esp. women.

I read ""The Kiss Quotient"" and I enjoyed that as well.  That book has a woman STEM-er and she's Asian, like me! It was just so nice to read about someone like me.  

The one thing I'll say is that you can find women Asian writers with women Asian protagonists but the career thing is a different kind of representation.  So much of the way we think is based on our careers and education, and when you are in a book, you see from the character's perspective.  And reading from your own perspective is just sooooo much easier.  I can see why a lot of white men, never read books that have female or minority protagonists.  No incentive to do the mental labor to read as someone else.  For someone like me,  pretty much every piece of content is through a perspective that looks nothing like my own.  

My hope is that due to technology, content makers will become more diverse, not just by race and gender, but also career, experience, education.  (That said, we could probably do with more blue-collar writers for one thing).  The gatekeepers are disappearing and the barriers to entry are coming down.

"Iv been in quite the reading slump so I did what anyone else would do, I sat in my room with my favorite band (City and Colour) plying in the background and went through all my books I haven‚Äôt read and read the inserts and found one called The Great Alone by Kristin Hannah. It was amazing and I loved It so I picked up the other Kristin Hannah book I had already which was Winter Garden. It was also amazing! So I went to Books-A-Million and picked up what the internet told me was her best book. The Nightingale. 

This book ripped me apart and put me back together multiple times throughout the entirety of my read. Kristin Hannah has a way with making characters flawed yet so lovable. This book took me to France before the start of WW2 and dragged me through the war in the most heartbreaking and compelling read I think iv ever experienced. 

You follow the lives of two sisters and their part (or in some instances lack there of) in the women‚Äôs resistance in France. Often when I watch war movies or read books like this, women and civilians are mentioned in passing but this books takes you on a journey that can only be described as the Underground Railroad of France. You also get broken family affairs, sister and motherly love, the heartbreaking reality of what women, children, and civilians had to endure during the most decimating war the world has ever seen. 

Kristin Hannah makes this book impossible to put down, over 550 pages and I read It in two sittings. That‚Äôs how compelling It is. The ending is as beautiful as a sorry like this can be and made me cry real tears, which a book hasn‚Äôt made me do in years. READ.THIS.BOOK.",books,1647
"I have recently become interested in learning more about politics and government. Specifically about fascism, socialism, communism, and their differences/similarities. The reason I am asking is that since I live in the United States, and our current government is questionable and at times scary I want to understand more about these types of ideologies. Perhaps how they arise, how people become entrapped in them, and how they essentially take over allowing people like Mussolini and Hitler in power. 

Not exactly sure if one book can cover all this, but I am more than happy to look into several.  I've also spent the majority of my life understanding natural sciences, so my history/social studies education ended in high school.

"So back when lockdown happened in March, I told myself the same thing I think a lot of other people told themselves:

*""Oh man this sucks, but at least I'll get to read all these books I've bought and not gotten around to!""*

**How very optimistic.**

In the 4 and a bit months since then, I've read ***2 books***, and one of those took 4 months to read start to finish (the second I read in just the last week, which I'll get to in a minute). I got distracted by absolutely everything instead. YouTube, social media, meeting up with friends once lockdown eased, trying to learn guitar, trying to learn violin, going for walks, just the lot. Everytime I had an inkling to read a book, I told myself ""oh in a bit"" and then I didn't.

Recently, I think it got burned out. I'd go through my phone, and just get bored of every app, every website, all of it. YouTube got stale, I ran out of places to go, and eventually I just thought ""fuck it, I'm gonna sit in the garden and finish the last third of *Catch-22*"", and over that day and the next day, I read about 180 pages. Someone please do the maths as to what increase in reading per/day that was. 

A week ago (actually technically 6 days ago) I started *The Last Policeman*, which is admittedly a lot easier to read than *Catch-22*. 6 days, it took me. Just today, I read about 200 pages. I flew through that thing. And again, it was because I just got bored of everything. So instead, I poured into this book, and it was just fucking phenomenal. God, I've not been so rushed by a book in years as I have by this and the last few chapters of *Catch-22*, and I think it's because, for the first time in so so long, I'm finally giving all my thought to what I'm reading.

Obviously, we'll see if this lasts. Maybe in an ironic twist of fate, I'll burn myself out on reading again and start some amateur painting or something. But recently, I've rekindled a love for books I haven't felt for years.",books,1946

‚Ä¢ *The Singularity* by Ray Kurzweil

A prediction on when the technological singularity ‚Äî a hypothetical point in time at which technological growth becomes uncontrollable and irreversible, resulting in unforeseeable changes to human civilization.

‚Ä¢ *The Industries of the Future* by Klaus Shwab

How the current Digital Revolution transformed the world. How advances in Data Science might change the way we deal with problems.

‚Ä¢ *Beyond Good and Evil* by Friedrich Nietzche

How our species is hindered by our black-and-white notion of morality.

‚Ä¢ *Sapiens* by Yuval Noah Harari

A narration of human history. It left a profound impact on me for the ideas it expounded.

‚Ä¢ *Thinking Fast and Slow* by Daniel Kahneman

How we humans tend to use our intuition far more than we notice. He advocates, therefore, that we must think more conscientiously. He points out that we humans fall into the thinking that we tend to think in causal terms ‚Äî when in fact most of the phenomena in the world is probabilistic. He also reiterates and destroys the notion in classical economics that humans are ""rational agents.""

"The story is about Montag, a fireman in a world where books are prohibited and it is their job to burn books and the houses of their owners. 

What makes this dystopian unique is the fact that this backwards evolution of society wasn‚Äôt caused by a corrupt government or an evil dictator wanting to control the masses. It was a result of the invention of popular media, of mass media. As Captain Beatty says, ‚ÄúOnce books appealed to a few people, here, there, everywhere. They could afford to be different. The world was roomy. But then the world got full of eyes and elbows and mouths. Double, triple, quadruple population. Films and radios, magazines, books leveled down to a sort of paste pudding norm, do you follow me? \[‚Ä¶\] Books cut shorter. Condensations. Digests. Tabloids. Everything boils down to the gag, the snap ending.‚Äù This evolution of society into the easy and the mediocre was then taken advantage off by the government, who saw it as a way to more easily control the masses. Thus, everything in this world is mediatized; religion is turned into commercial publicity, Jesus sales products on the screens that can be found anywhere and everywhere. 

This fictional world holds an incredible resemblance to some aspects of the current world, as the use of mass media increases and the world gets all connected through Instagram, Twitter and more. We are also living through the streaming explosion, with everything being turned into its own Netflix show, Amazon Original or HBO special. For the first time in history, classics can be experienced through a screen and books can be read to you. This advancement offers a lot of great possibilities, as geek culture turns into pop culture and the nerdy and fantastical becomes mainstream. On the other hand, the continual facilitation of experiences, could end in a downgrade in production quality, preferring mass appeal and money making to deep and rich storytelling. This similarity with the modern world is another aspect that makes this book a must-read in my opinion. 

And then there¬¥s the prose. Bradbury‚Äôs writing style is the best I‚Äôve encountered thus far. His very poetic (yet not overly flowery or purple) prose is what actually hooked me and carried me through the book, always remaining the highest of strengths. Right from the start, it was incredible: ‚ÄúIt was a pleasure to burn. It was a special pleasure to see things blackened and changed‚Ä¶‚Äù and it went on to deliver some of the best passages I‚Äôve ever read ‚ÄúSpeed up the film, Montag, quick. Click? Pic? Look, Eye, Now, Flick, Here, There, Swift, Pace, Up, Down, In, Out, Why, How, who, What, Where, Eh? Uh! Bang! Smack! Wallop, Bing, Bong, Boom! Digest-digests, digest-digest-digests. Politics? One column, two sentences, a headline! Then, in mid-air, all vanishes! Whirl man‚Äôs mind around about so fast under the pumping hands of publishers, exploiters, broadcasters, that the centrifuge flings out all unnecessary, time-wasting thought.‚Äù

The characters, even though they weren‚Äôt the focus of the story, were well realized and avoided some of the typical issues of classics without sexism or the likes. Characters like Captain Beatty or Clarisse were much more interesting and deep than they otherwise would appear, and really surprised me as far as characterization was concerned. That said, representation is not the focus of the story, so there‚Äôs not much in the sense of racial or LGTBI variety. And, with only five relevant characters, a big cast with complex dynamics is out of the question (in fact, Montag is the only one who really interacts with anyone else). 

Overall, I would rank Fahrenheit 451 as one of the best reading experiences of my life and definitely in my top ten greatest reads of all time as of now. I would also say this is the first book I‚Äôve read that I consider a must-read for everyone, especially with its current social relevance.

"I'm only halfway through atm so I mustn't judge too harshly. 

However I've lost count of the amount of metaphors which seem to be trying to funny but just come across as tortured. Y.T as a female character started life quite interesting but the amount of times things situations have devolved to the threat of her getting raped is bordering on creepy now. 

And the grand philosophy that overarches the whole thing seems to be ""American Capitalism is fucked up yo"". 

I dont know. Maybe I'm being harsh. Thoughts?",books,514

"Hey everyone, I'd like to know what your most controversial DNFs (did not finish) are and what are your reasons for it. I say controversial because it could be a book that is generally well-praised or have been highly recommended but ended up disappointing you and made you put the book down indefinitely. 

My recent controversial DNF would be Flowers for Algernon by Daniel Keyes. I just couldn't get into it at all. The main character was flat and the story was very predictable. So many other books did a fantastic job of portraying a POV from someone on the spectrum while still making the main character charismatic.

"As I fall asleep with goosebumps on my arms I am frightened to realize I have entered a new world. This world is small and holds little, though there is one thing in particular that stands out from the rest. An old man who gives detailed care to a collection of pots and plants walks around with a sharp slouch to his upper back. I have grown fond of this man, as I begin to wish he returned an expression of curiosity. As weeks pass I realize this man has been without family or friends for quite some time and has now place his social efforts into his lovely garden. Though the man is rather introverted, I learn about his life and attitude through childhood stories, hoping to invest in the advice he may be willing to lend. Growing old and out of shape this man was beginning to struggle physically and was forced to begin thinking about how he will handle his estate. With an exclusive circle to share his excess, this man did not give much thought to his leftover belongings. He soon passed away of natural causes, and had only asked of one thing in particular that was especially important for him, had he passed away. It was the task of taking care of his small garden. As I welcome the offer, the sun is burdened by clouds shadowing the body of a life that once was. Arriving at the garden the next day, I am distraught with depression and eagerness to continue what this man has created, despite the labor that may be required. Though it doesn‚Äôt take much time to realize something is much different about this piece of land. This poor mans plants are dead, withered, and old. Despite his death this is not recent, for these plants have been dead for a very long time. However with a moral obligation to a an old friend, I give heed to to his request. I will as well, water his garden of dead plants.",books,1810

"I had read Hanya Yanagihara's A Little Life almost 6 years ago. When it first came out, it had attracted some buzz and without thinking much, i checked it out of the local library expecting to read about a bildungsroman of 4 young lads in new york city. 

Without knowing it's true nature, I become mildly  addicted to the characters, and the sharp slide into the real narrative somewhere a quarter into the book both intoxicated and held me to ransom. It was a suffocating reading experience, when I was done i had to close my eyes for a full minute to pull myself away from that wretched reality and prevent myself from drowning in it. Til this day, i remembered the book quite fondly as a odd little obsession i had a while back. 

Recently i came across the free audiobook and decided to re-read it again. To my horror, as I read on, I realized that so much of the book had stayed with me despite the thick swathe of time between then and now. I still vividly remember almost all of the graphic sequences, it was like a dream that burrowed and burrowed until it materialised into a memory and finally into a scar. 

Going into the book fully aware of its premise was an uncomfortable, almost shameful experience. To put it another way, it was like watching torture porn for the sake of passing time, and it felt self-tainting and soul-rotting, like something that shouldn't be encouraged. 

Nevertheless, reading it for the second time meant that, instead of racing to the finish to find out what happens to the characters, I had time to truly process some of the themes presented by the book. I did find myself taking to some of the profound themes presented by the book, like how the story is a subversion of the modern fairy tale and a subtle, if not offhanded commentary on gender inequality, as a story of men written by a woman, whose idea of a fairy tale is being a man in new york finding love and success without having to bend backwards to find any societal role and stereotype.   


Despite the fairy tale setting, I liked the incredibly realistic message the story tries to present. That in life no one is guaranteed a happy ending, no matter how tough the beginning was. It is a reminder that no matter how small or how short your life is, it will always be long enough to be completely unpredictable and have the infinite capacity for limitless suffering and joy. That regardless of how harsh it is, there is always room for ambiguity, It can either be devastating or hopeful, crippling or carthartic, depending on your particular state of mind when reading the book. For example, the axiom of equality presented after one of Jude's most horrific experiences could either be interpreted as optimistic or pessimistic.

I also liked the realistic portrayal of mental trauma. So much of mental illness is about charging from one breaking point to the next, of this obsessive desire to challenge your own limits as well as those  of the ones around you. The lead character Jude does that to the ones he loves in the book, but it is also the same thing the author does with the reader, layering difficult passages one after another as if challenging our own limits of what is acceptable. 

As an aspiring writer myself, I often find myself thinking about Jude. I think about the process behind creating a character like this, by stripping away his personhood with trauma after trauma until what is left is a shell devoid entirely of ego, a shell that anyone can project themselves onto and fill with ceaseless empathy and adoration. I think about the process of creating such a magnetic and powerful character like Jude and I wonder if it is moral or ethical just because he is fictional. 

Although i resonated with some of the themes of the book, I will never recommend this book to anyone. Reading it for the second time, i am made keenly aware of how the plot is exploitative and sadistic. I see this as a story of how the author throws someone from real life with serious ptsd, into a fairy tale filled with fairy godfather like figures who would only coddle and love him, and then ironically destroying him in a setting that was designed specifically for redemption and healing.   


I have come to the conclusion that there are only 2 reasons why someone would enjoy the book. Firstly, Hanya Yanagihara's structure of the book is wicked and manipulative, of lengthy descriptions of horrific sexual assault and abuse, bookended by momentary reprieves of great love and friendship. In this case the reader is often conditioned to love the book in a way that is not unlike suffering from stockholm syndrome. I think this was very much the case when i first read the story. Also the original cover of the book is Peter Hujar's ""Orgasmic man"" and probably a sadistic reminder of how ""one man's pleasure is another man's pain"". Either way, no matter how much you  loved the book, its always good to remind yourself that it's probably for the wrong reasons. 

I am writing this not to beam about A Little Life, but to release myself from the wretched experience of reading it again. Needless to say, i don't think i will ever read it again, although i'm sure i'll have no need to cause the story of Jude will stick to me for a long time.",books,5250

Okay, sorry for posting about the same stuff but this book is really messing with my head. 

I don't think the book advocates suicide or champions it, and does an amazing job explaining and portraying the thought process and psychology that goes into it, and wonderfully changes how it saw suicide. 

1.I saw a wonderful and insightful comment about the nature of pain and pain abatement, and how it is unique to an individual and there is little others can understand about it. While I don't think it is making a stand for or against suicide, I feel that it is giving the message that suicides can be put off but not prevented no matter how much love and support is offered. I understand that his decision also had to do with his physical pain as much as his trauma and Willem's death (probably). *But honestly, what else can be offered other than help, love and support?* And with that, I understand it doesn't undo any physical and emotional pain, but really it breaks my heart that there is nothing that could be done by Harold and Andy and even Willem and still it makes them feel inadequate and tormented till the end of time.  If pain is really unsharable and incomprehensible to others, how is it really preventable? I know Jude's life is a little extreme. 

2.He was genuinely happy with Willem, and I think even if it didn't alleviate his pain, a part of me likes to think he would be alive if Willem were alive too because he gave him the kind of relationship he wanted, in his own words. I know he was to far gone to like himself but it just makes me feel like he would hang on to life for Willem. Does anyone feel that he would have been here if Willem was still here?",books,1682
"At the end of my copy of *Little Fires Everywhere*, there is a shortlist of discussion questions that book clubs can use. I tried answering some of them...and while I understood what happened and caught on large themes, like motherhood, I struggled to articulate meaningful answers.

"Ok, so my wife and I recently watched the Princess Bride with our kids. I loved it again, fantastic movie.  As good as when I was a child. My wife wanted to get the full experience with the book, so she bought a copy on the ol' Amazon.  


It shows up. She starts reading it and realizes, ""damn, this is a long intro of some random dude."" I pick up the book, look at the author and I'm like, ""sweetie, who is this author? The author from the movie is S Morgenstein. Who is this William Goldman? Some dude trying to profit on some classic.""  


This William Goldman's guy is on the front of the book, but the book I know - the book mentioned in the movie - the author is S Morgenstein. Like, what the hell is this William Goldman think he's doing putting his name on it?  


It gets worse. After an intro that is like a sixth of the book by this rando, he starts interjecting in the middle of the book. Or worse yet REMOVING parts of the book and then letting us know he cut some of the story out so we wouldn't have to worry about it. Oh my gawd. The nerve on this guy.  


I'm thinking, ""This idiot must have bought the rights from the estate of Morgenstein and then brutalized the book without consequence and republished it. This is the worst.""

"A few weeks ago students of my university organized a protest against police brutality, more generally against the systemic racism, directed towards African- Americans. In the protest, many black students shared shocking tales of how they have to deal with racism everyday, how they feel alienated in a place where most of the students don't look like them. One girl said that when she was 12, a cop pointed a gun at her and forced her to get into a dumpster to take out the trash she just threw into it.  


On its face this is a book where an unarmed teenager is shot dead by a police officer in front of his friend. But this is also the story of countless black people who have been threatened or killed by the police. Yes the specifics vary, but what binds them together is that they were targeted because of the color of their skin. This particular story is told from the perspective of Starr Carter, the witness of the murder. She is a sixteen years old black girl who goes to a school with mostly white children. We see her struggle to maintain the balance between her black and white world. In the school, she is always self-conscious, can't be herself because of the fear of exposing her 'ghetto' side. I suppose this is the sense of alienation the black students of my university was talking about.   


Just after she sees her friend gets murdered she is, quite naturally, terrified. She eventually recovers, talks to the police, anonymously appears on TV, gives full account of the event to a grand jury. Basically she does everything she is supposed to do as a law abiding citizen. But the grand jury decides not to indict the policeman. Can you imagine the anger she felt? Can you imagine the fury of the African-Americans after they see this happen again and again? Before you judge them for burning stores you may want to think about it.  


The author weaved many elements of racism into this story. The murdered child, Khalil, was a drug dealer. For some inexplicable reason, people tend to think that it excuses the killing of an unarmed kid. What is also ignored by people is why did he become a drug dealer. It's possible he did not have a choice, not everyone had. The fact that kids may not have any choice except becoming a drug dealer is primarily the fault of the system not of the kids. That's why 2Pac gave new meaning to THUG LIFE: The Hate U Give Little Infants Fucks Everybody. In the story someone argues for the cop saying that the number of blacks killed by blacks is more than killed by the cops. Yes, but how is it relevant? This is what Khalil Muhammad (coincidentally he is the namesake of the murdered kid) called 'the violence card'. The character of Hailey shows how it is very easy to be racist. At one point a black cop with his colleague unnecessarily harass Starr's father. Point being it is a problem of police system not of some white cops gone rogue. It is a sad story. But the author craftily injected humor into it which never seemed out of place.  


While reading the book a question kept bugging me. In US, if someone is pulled over they are supposed to keep their hands visible. If the cop asks for the license they are supposed to tell where the license is and ask for the permission to retrieve it. In the whole process the default assumption seems to be that the person will try to harm the police. Why is that? Were many polices harmed before such a strict rule was enforced? I didn't find anything that says the answer to the last question is yes. Did I miss something? The rule makes no sense to me. Airport security started checking shoes after Richard Reid attempted to detonate a shoe bomb. What is the story behind the traffic stop rule?",books,3701
"This was such an incredible book, it's taken me a few days to process it after finishing. A Little Life tells the story of four friends who attend college together in New York. They are incredibly close friends and each come from different backgrounds and upbringings, though they share common interests in art and culture. As the story progresses, the emphasis grows on one individual, Jude, who is remarkably brilliant yet emotionally and physically scarred from his traumatic youth. From there we are taken through their lives into adulthood as they age, grow, love, learn, and cry.

There's so much to say about this book. The story is deep and detailed. The characters and relationships feel real and personal. Common themes throughout the book include trauma and abuse, love and friendship, honesty and openness, loyalty and hidden secrets. In addition to this wonderful plot, even more captivating is the style and technique used to tell it.

Yanagihara's writing style is packed with details and moves with great momentum. Although it is dense, it doesn't drag and I was never bored reading it. The sentences are long, but easy to absorb. In each chapter, the narrator takes us through a journey filled with tangents and flashbacks, where time disappears and we are left with a wide panoramic view of the characters lives. Not only this, but the actual perspective and writing changes. The beginning of the book starts in past tense, like a retelling of a story, and later moves into present tense. The focus changes onto different characters, and at some points even moves from 3rd person narrative to 1st and even 2nd person. I've never read a book that changes perspective so much, and all this stylistically works very well and adds to the depth and vast story which follows the characters entire lifespan.

I really don't have many bad things to say about this book. Sometimes the ""he"" pronouns were ambiguous and I had reread, but this may have been an intentional way of blending the four boys likeness together. Jude's story also has traumatic abuse, so a trigger warning is warranted. However, despite the depressing subject matter, this book portrays the beauty of life, love, and relationships, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to get lost in a wonderful, heartbreaking, beautiful story.",books,2317

"Magician
By Raymond E. Feist

Magician remains, to this very day, one of the most incredible experiences I've ever had with any form of art. For those of you who do not know much about the book, it's a fantasy book in the Riftwar Saga- the first book infact- and follows the story of Pug.

The story of Magician isn't genre defining or game changing. While it does bring a lot of new ideas to the table, it doesn't necessarily revolutionise the art of fantasy story telling. And I think that's fine. What the book does, it does incredibly well. There are parts of the story that will move you, if not for the amazing host of characters, then for the highly immersive way it's told. There's something oddly transcendent about the storytelling in Magician, and I just can't put my finger on it. 

However, my love for Magician does not stem from its story. It has far more to do with the emotions it invokes in you through the world it builds. A small, but significant, inclusion in Magician, was the two maps I saw at the very beginning. I have a fascination with maps, and love plotting my way through them as the story progresses. When I saw the two maps, I was stunned. I tried to find correlations between the two, but I never could. I won't spoil why or how that is, but trust me, finding out is one of the best experiences you could have. 

There are two parts that I think Magician's world really nails.

1) Scale- There's this constant sense of scale. I don't exactly know how to articulate what I mean, but the sense of magnitude in its forces of good and evil, the sense of understanding of how universal issues arise from small, is humbling. The effect is similar to that of being a hobbit in Mordor. The unfathomable size of what you're experiencing is mind boggling.

2) Use of The World- Unpopular opinion, I think the Lord of The Rings trilogy of books is just a tad bit overrated. I suppose that's more to do with my taste, which is probably not the best, but when I finished reading them, I felt unfulfilled. There was this feeling that so much more could have been done with the world that the story took place in, and I really feel like a lot of that was forgone.
The Magician fills up that niche for me. As I've gushed about already, there's this incredible sense of scale, and this also applies to the world. The lore and environmental storytelling is top-notch, never have I been so invested in a book world as I've been in Magician. Raymond E. Feist uses the world to its absolute max, and I'm so grateful he does. The result is extraordinary.

Is the book
 perfect? Absolutely not. It falls victim to so many clich√©s and a few events can be rather predictable. But, in my opinion, all those pieces of jank are part of the charm of this book. And it's better with them, than without.

As to the trilogy of books in the Riftwar Saga. I read Magician(a compilation to both parts) and this one I highly recommend. The next two, Silverthorn and Darkness at Sethanon are, while good, not necessarily the best fantasy books you will ever read. However, with how Magician's story may grab you, I'd suggest at least finishing off those character arcs.
 
And that's about it. I'd love to know what other people think of this book. I know this 'review' or 'opinion piece' was rather long, but my love for this book is something I've always wanted to express like this. Thank you for reading through this whole thing. I really appreciate you taking the time to do so. Have a great day and keep reading.‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è",books,3517
"What fresh hell is this? Actually, Peck‚Äôs take on the underworld is quite fresh and not at all what I was expecting. Now, if you‚Äôd told me that hell was a library where the books were unreadable, I‚Äôd say that was some *Saw*-level torture porn.

But that is not what this book is about. In fact, Peck is at first able to sell this premise to the reader in such a way that it appears to be a pretty light sentence. By the time we realize how truly horrible it is, we‚Äôve learned there are far worse things to be found in hell.

Other people.

That‚Äôs right, this book about the afterlife, written by a Mormon ecologist, deserves a place firmly on the existentialism shelf of your library. 

Let‚Äôs backtrack a moment for context. In this philosophical novella, Soren, a lifelong Mormon, dies and learns that he has chosen the wrong god and has been sent to a Zoroastrian hell. It‚Äôs not too bad at first: Meals are provided. You can still have sex. You can get drunk without hangovers. You are once again 25 and wake every morning pain free. And you live for near eternity inside a library.

However, each occupant of hell has one task, and that is to search the stacks of books until they find the one that tells their life story in full. Once that‚Äôs accomplished, this denizen of hell will be reshelved in heaven.

There are two problems:

First, this hell is based on Jorge Luis Borges‚Äô short story, ‚ÄúThe Library of Babel,‚Äù which concerns a library that contains not just every book that has ever been written, but also every possible book that ever could be written, including all configurations of letters, numbers and symbols.

It‚Äôs not infinite, but may as well be for practical purposes. Even worse, not only does it take eons to find the correct book, it is next to impossible to even find a readable one. (In this biblio multiverse, there necessarily exists a book consisting only of periods, another of semicolons, and every combination of the two.)

Books, books everywhere, but not a one to read.

It‚Äôs a fate worse than that of Henry Bemis, who at least could take comfort in suicide or look forward to a natural expiration date.

The second problem with this hell is that Soren is not alone, which is a mixed bag. On the wall of the library, there is a list of rules for enjoying a good afterlife. The first rule:

‚ÄúPlease be kind. Treat others as you would like to be treated. Failure to do this will bring unhappiness and misery to you and your fellow citizens.‚Äù

Considering how poorly humanity followed this rule on Earth, you can imagine how well this goes over in hell.

*A Short Stay in Hell* is a quick and easy read. I read it in less than two hours, but don‚Äôt be fooled. The final page is just the beginning of the exercise, not the end of the book. Unlike most philosophy, the reading is the easy part. It is the thought experiment that occupies your mind long after that is the challenge. I‚Äôve struggled so much to describe this book that I‚Äôve already referenced Dorothy Parker, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, *The Twilight Zone*, existentialism in general and the *Saw* franchise in search of analogs.

And I‚Äôm not done. There‚Äôs some Kierkegaard coming as well. That‚Äôs a lot to pack into a 102-page book.

That said, it‚Äôs not perfect. Parts of the novella would have benefited from a deeper study (such as the rise and reign of the Direites, a violent cult that takes control of Soren‚Äôs part of the library). The quality of the prose is also inconsistent. Peck has a lot of strengths (philosophy, science, writing, theology), but urban fantasy is not one of them. His depiction of the Zoroastrian demon feels like a clumsy attempt to mimic the humor of Christopher Moore or Tom Robbins (though I was picking up some major Sean Murphy peripatetic vibes).

Otherwise, his writing is direct, easy to read and unobtrusive, but Peck‚Äôs intellect and ideas are much stronger than his prose. He has masterfully recreated an absurd scenario that would make any of the French existentialists proud:

A man finds himself inside a near-infinite library of gibberish and is tasked with finding the true story of his life (or the meaning of his existence, you might say). He wakes in a random region of the library that is of no relation to the location of the book he needs to find. He has no map. There are others who have, by chance, been born around the same time as him and happen to also occupy the same random section of the library. And in the afterlife, as in the original, the search for meaning often gets sidelined by disasters, distractions and creature comforts.

There are nine rules posted to the library walls, and they read like an existentialist creed: be kind, try not to die, everything is temporary, you can feel incredibly lonely despite never actually being alone.

Mostly, it‚Äôs the other people that make the library unpleasant. As above, so below.

So what about Kierkegaard? The library is divided by a wide chasm, with no way to cross from one side to the other (and what if the book you need is on the other side?). It‚Äôs an unbridgeable gap of unfathomable depth. An abyss, if you will. Soren (like his Danish namesake) considers leaping into it, but doesn‚Äôt do so until it becomes the only way to escape the daily torture of the Direites.

He quickly learns that in the abyss you can fall for thousands of years and still not hit the bottom, dying a million times from starvation along the way.

It‚Äôs a fate worse than Kierkegaard ever contemplated. Missing is the romance of surrender, the glorious descent and the annihilation of self. When our Soren leaps into the gap, it is an act of desperation, not salvation.

And it‚Äôs a long way down.",books,5675
"Hi all! Have gotten fully back into reading this quarantine and have been going through books at an absolute record pace.

"Hopefully out of the 18 million people that are here, at least one person has read this book and understands what I'm going to say.

I'm ~140 pages into this book and I really don't want to read on. I'm a student who hasn't started university yet, but I want to study history and I didn't know much about the French Revolution, so I bought Citizens. Given that it is supposed to be an accessible account of the events of this period, it certainly does not come across that way.

French terms are used frequently with either no translation or explanation of meaning within context. Big, literary words are used where smaller ones would do just fine. Characters are introduced left, right and centre to the point where I can't keep up.

It is as if the writer assumed a level of knowledge about the topic which I don't possess, which seems to contradict the aims of the book. All of these things have combined to make my reading thus far a bit of a chore.

I really want to finish this book because I would like to understand more about the French Revolution and obviously history in general, but at the moment I just can't bring myself to. So, if anyone has read and enjoyed this book from a similar starting position to my own, how did you do it?",books,1246

"""As it happens, I think that in really good stories, the whole is always greater than the sum of the parts. If that were not so, the following would be a perfectly acceptable version of ""Hansel and Gretel‚Äù:

Hansel and Gretel were two children with a nice father and a nice mother. The nice mother died, and the father married a bitch. The bitch wanted the kids out of the way so she'd have more money to spend on herself. She bullied her spineless, soft-headed hubby into taking Hansel and Gretel into the woods and killing them. The kids' father relented at the last moment, allowing them to live so they could starve to death in the woods instead of dying quickly and mercifully at the blade of his knife. While they were wandering around, they found a house made out of candy. It was owned by a witch who was into cannibalism. She locked them up and told them that when they were good and fat, she was going to eat them. But the kids got the best of her. Hansel shoved her into her own oven. They found the witch's treasure, and they must have found a map, too, because they eventually arrived home again. When they got their, Dad gave the bitch the boot and they lived happily ever after. The End.

I don't know what you think, but for me, that version's a loser. The story is there, but it's not elegant. It's like a Cadillac with the chrome stripped off and the paint sanded down to dull metal. It goes somewhere, but it ain't, you know, boss.""",books,1451

"So I just came to think about this book. A friend of mine (I‚Äôll call her T) went to the bookstore a few years ago and got some books with her siblings. They perused and got a few books each, when T saw this one copy of a book. It had a very 80‚Äôs aesthetic, and was named My Best Friend‚Äôs Exorcism. There were no other copies of it, and she thought it looked cool so she grabbed it. The brother took the books they‚Äôd gathered and went to pay. Then he calls T over and he, their sister and the woman at the counter all look at her. 
‚ÄúWhere did you find this book?‚Äù
T, who had been in her own thoughts, kind of shrugged and pointed vaguely. ‚ÄúSomewhere over there. Why?‚Äù
The cashier looks at her. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen this book before. It doesn‚Äôt even have a price tag.‚Äù
They find this strange, but decides to get it anyway. Idk how they dealt with the price but they got it some way or another. 
We found nothing of it online, just some creepy posts on tumblr. My friend starts reading it, but she has a tendency to jump between books and never really finish one, so I borrow it.
It‚Äôs such a good book. Abby and Gretchen are best friends, sharing everything, until Gretchen starts acting very strange. Abby realises Gretchen has a demon living in her, making her do the craziest things. Abby decides to try to do an exorcism. 
I highly recommend this book. There‚Äôs lots of 80‚Äôs references for anyone who likes that, and some real creepy demon stuff. Also I‚Äôm not saying the girls are lesbians but... *shrugs* idk bro, seemed pretty gay to me. 

I checked online and there‚Äôs a lot more things about it now, so I believe it was just a fun stunt to hype the book or something. But I remember how we were slightly creeped out by the fact that this book about demons just showed up in a store.",books,1781

"So given my need to quarantine for 14 days after an impromptu UK visit from Spain, I've decided to take the opportunity to dive into my ""unread"" pile, and I've started off with a very nice first edition copy of Enigma by Robert Harris, probably most famous for Fatherland and The Ghost.

Enigma, as you might infer from the title, is mostly set in Bletchley Park during the Second World War, although very pleasantly the setting is in 1943, later than many popular depictions of the Park, and Alan Turing isn't seen at all except in a couple of minor flashbacks, although Tom Jericho, the main character, is clearly at least partly based on Turing.

Harris is a superb writer of story, and the plot rattles along at a good pace, only seeming to slow for a page or two every so often when Jericho stops to remember his lost love. There are plenty of twists and interesting moments, although one of the main plot points of there being a German spy loose in the park doesn't come up until near the end, and is really spoiled by the inside of the dust jacket.

The supporting cast are generally well executed, particularly Jericho's sidekick Hester, who is extremely capable in her own right and probably more interesting than Jericho as well. Unfortunately, Harris does introduce us to too many of the codebreakers in Hut 6, and almost all of them blur together for lack of page time.

Overall, Enigma doesn't compare well to Fatherland. Part of this at least is the nature of the setting, a strange world where Germany won the war being far more interesting to read about than the slightly more impenetrable world of ciphers and cryptanalysts at Bletchley.

Jericho, although not a bad character, is also nowhere near as likeable a man as Fatherland's Xavier March, and the horrors he faces are nothing compared to those that March confronts.

Although I enjoyed the book, just as I have with everything else that Harris has written, I definitely think it ranks low in the list of his works, certainly worse than Fatherland, the Cicero trilogy and The Ghost, which are my favourites.",books,2081

"Before I start, let me begin by saying I have read a lot. The entire Sherlock Holmes, all of Lovecraft, the great Gatsby, trainspotting, Frankenstein, Alot of Niel Gaiman (Liked Sandman, but not American Gods), Shakespeare's more popular works, a Clockwork Orange, and the list goes on. 
  So I started reading it, I read the green mile and while I enjoyed it God does he go on about how it hurts to pee. Perhaps it was a different time in the 50's (which king wasn't really a part of, but there are flash forwards to the characters grown up), but my lord his dialogue is just past unbelievable to the point of weird and it goes on and on. 

Here's the line that made me begin to question if he's pulling it out of his...:

""Kinky briefcase, Sexual Accountant, here‚Äî I had a fellow come in the other day who wanted to know what the worst thing was about getting AIDS...I told him right away‚Äî trying to explain it to your mother how you picked it up from a Haitian girl. Until next time, this is Kinky Briefcase, Sexual Accountant, saying ' you need my card if you can't get hard.' "" 

Mr. King is known as being one of the greatest writers, and this line pretty much sums up the ridiculous writing I sometimes have to read twice because there is so much randomness. There are sentences that start on a point of focus, then randomly all of the sudden he starts rambling about a completely different subject, mid god-d sentence! 
 Overall, I feel like I can see the future, a future where I force myself to continue and 500 pages in come across something so ridiculous I toss the book into the sewer drain, hoping someone down below surrounded by other copies replies with a, "" It all floats down here.""",books,1701

"Okay. So I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôm even trying to say with this, so hang with me please.

I‚Äôve owned this novel for something like three years. Opened it this year as one of the 52 that I‚Äôve lined-up for 2020 (yes I know don‚Äôt read for volume but it works for me so relax). 

I‚Äôm still only about a third of the way through the story. As a native English speaker, I found it just slightly more difficult to track as you have to be cognizant of the characters‚Äô name similarities as the book ramps up. So I suppose it would be safe to say that the first twenty or so pages required a little more effort than most novels do. 

Then, however, the book explodes. I don‚Äôt know the right words for it, but I‚Äôve never felt so immersed in magic or filled with a second-hand nostalgia in my entire literary life. As each generation of the family continues to grow, you feel so deeply in touch with them that it hurts at times. You‚Äôll time travel through your own youth and adulthood as you watch each character deal with highly relatable, even though often magical, coming-of-age experiences. 

I‚Äôm astonished that the original was written in Spanish, as it seems that no magic was lost in translation.

I don‚Äôt jump on to recommend books on here often, but it would be a crime not to share the way this book had already moved me.

"Controversial, banned, censored - this literary classic has more to it than the inevitable and problematic questions that from it arise about racism and slavery. 

It's also a story about a young boy whose yearning for death at times feels almost suicidal. A boy who doesn't fit in the world he lives in, an absolute outcast. Above all, a boy who seems to yearn for some kind of control in his chaotic world full of murderers, renegades, and swindlers. It's touching to think that Jim is the closest thing to a father figure he gets and the moments they both experience together, all by themselves, seem to be when Huck is the happiest. Even during a storm. 

 This is one of my favorite quotes from the novel and it's almost heartbreaking every time I read it:

"This regards the 1987 Signet Classics edition of Victor Hugo's *Les Mis√©rables*, complete and unabridged, translated by Lee Fahnestock and Norman MacAfee, based on the original French to English translation by C.E. Wilbour. All spoilers to follow.

I'd tried reading *Les Mis√©rables* several years ago but quite honestly got tired with Hugo's overwrought prose somewhere in Volume II. Since the world is ending and I ran out of library books, I figured this was a good time to give it another go. I'm glad I did because while Hugo doesn't get any less wrought as the story grows, it's both a fascinating exploration of 19th Century society in the shadow of revolution and an insight into the psyche of the time, still wrestling with old aristocratic habits and new republican ideals.

But having said all that - and planning to say more - what really defines this gargantuan novel is a morality play, centered on the character of Jean Valjean. Imprisoned for stealing bread and kept for four times his original sentence because of repeated escape attempts, he is both sympathetic while being hardened and cunning enough to be a compelling hero. Some might be attempted to call him Byronic but rather his turn from a life of wickedness - or what society deems wicked - to the good is much more religious. Embittered and alienated from all humanity at the start, the kindness and forgiveness of a provincial bishop sets him on his path to redemption at the start to which he pursues with as little regard for the mores and norms of society as when he was a criminal but with rather with a focus on compassion and relieving the suffering of others.

Valjean finds his project of human betterment embodied in the orphaned Cosette. Orphaned by his own charitable machinations in his guise as Monsieur Madeleine, the benefactor from nowhere who builds up the factory town Montreuil-sur-Mer. A factory that employs - and degrades and throws away - Cosette's martyred mother Fantine. But before he can swoop in and save the poor orphan, Valjean's past catches up with him in a morality play within a morality play.

Enter Inspector Javert, Hugo's embodiment not of Good but of Order. Javert's commitment to law and authority is tautological - it must be obeyed because it is law and authority - and he takes visible pleasure in subjecting others to the law's severity. At first suspecting the beloved Mayor Madeleine of being the convict Valjean, he later recants his theory as some poor dolt in a neighboring town is arrested for stealing apples and roundly accused of being the infamous Valjean. Real name Champmathieu, he is subjected to a Kafkaesque trial in which his insistence upon his true identity is proof of his guilt.

This play within a play serves to illustrate Hugo's larger point about the society of his day and law and order. How stealing bread or simply mistaken identity can condemn someone to lifelong ignominy, the old feudal castes persisting under different names, as further demonstrated when ""Monsieur Madeleine"" storms the trial to proclaim himself the true Jean Valjean, to which everyone reacts with incredulity. He can't possibly be a convict because he is a respected mayor and businessman.

However, as much as Hugo challenges these lingering ideas of inherent goodness and wickedness, of castes assigned either success or misery for all time, he still cannot break free of the essentialist view of human nature. This Great Man theory is a constant theme through Hugo's novel, often in tension with his professed republican ideals. For all his focus on the dignity and suffering of the lower classes, it's only through the superiority of Mayor Madeleine - the reformed Jean Valjean - that uplifts the community of Montfermeil. When he surrenders himself to the law to save Champmathieu, the whole town goes back to seed.

The long digression on the Battle of Waterloo further cements this paradox in Hugo's thinking. Hugo talks glowingly of Napoleon, of how his incredible successes had to be ordained by Providence, and contrasts this with the dull and offensively un-brilliant Wellington. But the dull guy won.

To go on my own brief digression - and Hugo would approve, having dedicated an entire chapter to the history of the sewers of Paris - this Great Man theory so enraptured the French post-Napoleon that it arguably led to their defeat in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71. The Grand Armee had long been accustomed to being the instrument of their supreme commander's genius, but where Napoleon III proved timid and dejected the mid-rank officers of the Prussian forces quickly exploited every opportunity to drive the fight across Europe and back to Paris. Not through any particular genius but rather through disciplined efficiency.

Speaking of the siege of Paris and glorious Great Men getting ground under by forces of history, the tension between Hugo's conflicting ideals also manifests in the dichotomy between Enjolras and Thenardier. The former a young republican idealist and leader of a sort of proletariat salon of downwardly mobile intellectuals styling themselves revolutionaries, the latter an unscrupulous thief and con artist always striving after a new payday. Thenardier appears first in the narrative, he and his wife nominally accepting Cosette into their home to care for her while Fantine works herself to an early grave to provide for the little girl. Thenardier naturally makes the little girl a Cinderella-like slave, while constantly demanding more and more payments from Fantine, citing the many expenses incurred raising Cosette. Which is a blatant lie.

When Valjean escapes the chain gang yet again and comes to rescue Cosette - his coat sewn up with bank bills from his Madeleine fortune - Thenardier lets the little girl go for a song and a mere 15,000 Francs. He's got a good grift going with a tavern at the time, where his wife gets to lord it over everyone and his own daughters get to play with dolls and a kitten. But when this family appears again, they are fallen much lower in circumstances and are living in a squalid boardinghouse. Thenardier is left to composing fraudulent letters begging well-to-do Parisians - or who he thinks are well-to-do - for a little remittance here and there, while quite literally whoring his own daughters out to his criminal contacts. As much pains as Hugo goes to in portraying society beating down the ""good"" scoundrels like Jean Valjean, here he offers no such compassion for low and grasping people in a chapter even named ""The Noxious Poor.""

Contrast with the impoverished in matter but not in spirit Enjolras and his coterie. At first secondary to the bildungsroman of Marius that makes up the second half of the novel, they represent the boiling political radicalism that claimed descent from the Revolution but doesn't have much to show in terms of concrete plans - at least as presented by Hugo. They have plenty of noble airs and when the uprising of 1832 comes, they all take up arms and man the barricades gladly, but they have no real plans beyond dying gloriously for ""the cause.""

Really, the particulars don't concern Hugo so much as Progress. Like Hegel, he sees a deliberate direction to history, rising from the barbarous Ancien Regime into the glorious Republic of freedom and reason. And in service of this Progress, the violence of the barricades is completely warranted. Enjolras feels morally empowered by his ideals to kill not just the gendarmes mobilized to suppress the uprising but also to execute those whose rebellion is too sloppy and undisciplined. He even plans to execute a police spy within the barricade - the long absent from the narrative at this point Inspector Javert - but is bamboozled by Jean Valjean who arrives to rescue not just his nemesis Javert but also Marius, who is due for a wedded ever after ending with Cosette. In the process, he manages to assist the barricade without taking a single life - allowing Hugo to maintain Valjean's sainthood while also indulging in the thrill of revolutionary violence.

In the midst of all this bloody climax though, we get to see an unintentionally more compelling character. Eponine, daughter of Thenardier whose arc takes her from playing with a kitten in the Thenardier Inn to walking barefoot and broken through the slums of Paris illustrates how society fails the unfortunate. She descends through the lower strata of acceptable morality not out of any personal failings or even mistakes, but rather from the misfortune of birth. Her father - and mother, to a lesser degree - are the few truly wicked in Hugo's novel and their vulgar machinations drag their daughter into ignominy, poverty, and an untimely death. A better illustration of how society fails the less fortunate than the transcendent sainthood of Jean Valjean.

All of this being said, I can appreciate how much of a classic *Les Mis√©rables* is but I wouldn't recommend it as a quarantine read. You'd have a better time with George Eliot's *Middlemarch*, which offers a more digestible prose style and greater psychological depth. But if you've read that already, you should give Hugo's magnum opus a go.",books,9175
"As a preface, I started as an avid plot-driven reader of crime thrillers and speed reading was my preferred method. I sped through ‚Äòboring‚Äô descriptions on settings, sped through ‚Äòuseless‚Äô dialogues, and sometimes even flipping right to the end of the book just to find out about the conclusion. But all that changed when I started on my own novel four years ago. And I would like to share with you how writing changed the way I read.

**The Setting**

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm alone when I say that I used to skip the parts of a book that describe the settings. Talks about the mountains, trees and seas just didn‚Äôt appeal to me. I wasn‚Äôt interested in how a room looked like, or how a castle looked like, or even an alien world. 

But when I started to write, I realised that words were not just words. Words gave life. Words had no boundaries. The writer shapes the world in his book with little details that helps a reader become immersed. In fact, as a writer writes, he himself is drawn into the world he is writing, experiencing the settings in the novel through the eyes of different characters. The setting is a foil that envelops the journey.

**The Supporting Characters**

Only interested in the main character and whoever was his or her mortal foe. That was how I read books in the past. Tell me more about how ingenious the criminal was, and how much mightier the detective proved to be. The supporting characters? Nada. Not interested. Unless they were there to sing  praises of the protagonist. 

But when I started writing, I realised that the supporting characters did not have to be ‚Äòsupporting‚Äô! They could impact a novel in ways that a protagonist would never have. They could come with their own emotional rollercoasters, frailties, heroic moments, cruelty, and more. In some ways, every character is a protagonist in his own right. And now that I‚Äôve been paying more attention to the side characters in the novels I read, I actually grew to like some of them more than the main.

**Nuances**

A fluttering of hearts, a batting of eyelashes, a trembling of souls intertwined. Do these words mean anything to you? The old me? No. I wasn‚Äôt interested in the ‚Äòminor‚Äô details. Why should I care about their little thoughts and actions? Bring me the ‚Äòbig boom‚Äô, bring me the parts that will make me go ‚Äòwow‚Äô.

Oh how wrong I was. The most important thing I learned as I wrote, was that the characters in the novels are not inanimate beings. They are living, breathing creatures, just like you and me. They can feel cold, they can feel pain, and they can feel joy. Toss a stone in their heart pool, and you will see the ripples reflected on their faces. Don't ignore the nuances, for they bring out the souls of the characters.

**Self-Reflection**

Are you reading a novel just for the suspense? For the twist at the end to blow your mind? That was me. Taken for a ride through a gripping tale from start to finish. And then I put down the book and say ‚Äòthat ending was beautiful‚Äô or ‚Äòthat ending was unexpected‚Äô. Nothing else.

But books can mean so much more. What are some of the overarching themes? What are some of the recurring motifs? Many writers build their stories with one or many interwoven philosophical threads and they are all there to evoke a deeper self-reflection in the readers. Some books have themes that are laid bare and easily digestible, while others are buried deep and require further thought and introspection. We can take so much more from a book if we pay attention to them.

**Live the Book**

Don't just ‚Äòread‚Äô the book. Live it :)",books,3573
"I've read the book, and am rewatching the newer films back to back. I just started the second one when the gay dude gets it.

But I guess maybe I missed or was unclear on who exactly IT targets? Is it only kids? Cause if that were the case, getting the adult gay dude in the opening of the second one, kinda doesn't make sense.

From the book, I got the jist that Pennywise fed mostly on children but ultimately fed on the weak. 

What is your opinion on this?

...

Also after reading The Dark Tower series,  drawing the conclusion that the Crimson King was possibly the same species as Pennywise, he was very different and kinda made me think that maybe Pennywise is a mentally challenged example of their species. Just babbling.",books,731
"I read it on a suggestion from someone on r/suggestmeabook (to someone else), and man is this is a great genre novel. The setting is so deliciously weird and ""off"" it's like reading an episode of Welcome to Nightvale but the author takes it seriously and builds a world around the weirdness. Love that the protagonist is not a stereotype in any way and the ending is Lovecraftian horror done right. &gt;! I do wish Mona saved poor Professor Coburn before she called it a day though !&lt;

I guess I am a sucker for books which develop their own mythology. I have been a huge Gaiman fan for years but have been getting more and more disillusioned with his rinse-repeat style of repurposing cultural mythos. This gave me the fix I have been missing.",books,747
"Decided I wanted to read some of the books that are known as the classics. This not being familiar territory, I have persisted with reading the introductions on the Oxford and penguin editions, although informative they just give away major plot spoilers. Some would say well don't read it then, but then why call it an introduction. I have noticed on newer prints they have started to add these after which makes much more sense. Ok rant over, does anyone feel they add value reading them before hand or do most wait until after to read them?",books,543
I‚Äôm almost nearing the end of TTLUtS and have enjoyed it immensely - my one slight bugbear is the constant descriptions and classifications of species and measurements of travel and land masses etc. are a little tedious and kind of break up the excitement of the adventure. Do JVs other novels go into so much scientific/geographic detail as this book? I was going to go for The Mysterious Island next.,books,402
"In reading G. Boccaccio's book I've started to wonder if it's true that e.g. A father could go to the King and arrange for a man to be hanged for getting his unwed daughter pregnant?

I know there were far worse things happening in these times. I'm just wondering if the drama is set in the present or ""older times"".",books,316
"Just finished reading Cho Nam-Joo's Kim Jiyoung, Born 1982. It only took a couple hours and was such an important look at reality through fiction.

"My cousin said this is her favorite and book and my sister loved it as well. I trusted their judgment and bought a copy of my own. I had just finished it actually.

Anyway I thought I‚Äôd enjoy the book but I didn‚Äôt quite as much as I expected to. I didn‚Äôt hate it but I wish I could love it more. Truthfully I think I only finished the book for the sake of finishing it. Halfway through it and I was telling myself that it would get better. I loved the narration though. The imagery in the storytelling appealed to my senses. However, the plot seemed underwhelming. I think I was confused as the main characters were about the ‚Äúgame‚Äù that they were playing. And that didn‚Äôt change even until the story ended.

"I don't think this breaks any of the subreddit rules - I'm not looking for a recommendation to read the rest of the series; genuinely curious though.

&amp;#x200B;

I see a lot of high praise for Shogun by James Clavell. I've recently gotten into more fuedal style fiction / series lately, and I see this book recommended... ***A LOT.*** I hear how well crafted the story is, how wonderful the characters are, how engrossing the story is, etc. I was able to get a copy at Barnes and Noble, and I'm not very far into it (only about 100 pages) - but I definitely see why the book is widely recommended. It's very good so far, and from what I heard, it gets better. 

&amp;#x200B;

What perplexes me though, is that I never hear anything about the rest of the Asian Saga books. Are they not worth reading, as in do they not live up to the tone, and world of Shogun - or is Shogun just good enough as a self encapsulated story to not worry about the others so much if you don't want to continue reading on after the first book? 

&amp;#x200B;

I'd like to think the rest of the books are good as well, if James Clavell has spent time in this world and developed these characters, and crafted this story - but I could be wrong.

Since I don't see the sequels recommended often, or at all - for those of you that have read them: Is it worth continuing the series after Shogun?",books,1370
"I have two emails from Amazon, one from the first of the month and one from Sunday the 26th, both stating Prime customers receive two free Prime First Reads books, but when I went to order the second it wasn't available for free. 

I spent over an hour on hold in total. I emailed the customer service rep screenshots of my email. I also mentioned I saw a review where another person received the same email and (seemed to) successfully redeem their two books. After forty five minutes of waiting on hold while he talked to his supervisor, he came back on to tell me that the promo is for one book only.

I pushed back on that, and he said he'd heard another customer received the same email, it was a glitch in their system, and the complaint was escalated to a higher technical service department. I asked if he'd do the same for me, and he did say he would, and that he'd get back to me in a few business days (I really, really hope he actually does and that he wasn't just putting me off).

But I have had Amazon credit me for significantly more money to reimburse me from third party sellers who failed to ship the correct item and failed to make good on a replacement. This their program, for digital content. They regularly give me a dollar for digital content to wait a little longer for my packages. Why in the heck wouldn't a, ""Sure, yeah, it was a glitch, but here's the book!"" be an easy give?

I don't mean to be a curmudgeon over this; and truly, if they hadn't wasted so much of my time escalating to the next department and keeping me on hold with that crappy music, I probably would have shrugged and moved on. But now I feel like maybe I need to start shopping elsewhere for my books. Amazon's easy because I have Prime, but I'm hardly using it right now. And I've been meaning to get a Kobo anyway.",books,1817

"Hello bookworms! Anyone else in here who reads Alex Cross Series by James Patterson?? I'm currently reading Double Cross (13th book). 

I am fan of the series but sadly I'm starting to get bored with it. The way of writing is exciting as always but I think I've already cracked the code for most of the plot/storyline -- show the killer at the beginning and reveal it fully by the end. I love reading crime-thriller because of the plot twists and mysteries. I feel the stories have become too predictable with the series. I'm planning to switch genre for a while then come back to the series.   


For those people who have read farther than the 13th book, is it worth to continue reading? Is there something that I should look forward to?  


Thank you very much!!",books,765

1. Would you accept A Little Life without the epilogue?
2. Do you think A Little Life makes it seem like there is no redemption, no amount of love, affection, praise, positivity can make up for past trauma and leaves you feeling inadequate and heartbroken on behalf of Harold and (late) Willem who cared a lot about him staying alive?",books,348
"I just finished reading Crime and Punishment and I was overwhelmed by a plethora of emotions that sprung up, the book seems to me as a psychological rollercoaster. The way that urban life in the 19th century St. Petersburg was portrayed, connected too many dots with the actual city life and the afflictions that megacities have brought to society. The selfishness, depravity, depression, impotence and nihilism of the surrounding characters greatly emphasizes how little we¬¥ve advanced morally, compared to the immense technological leap we¬¥ve taken as a society. Also, the rampaging social inequality of the setting makes me feel helpless and troubled, while in my opinion, demonstrates how the chasm separating billionaires from most of us is widening and seemingly endless.

However not everything is dark, the way that Raskolnikov¬¥s family stand against Dounia marriage with Luzhin is truly inspiring and heart-wrenching. Even when they were sunk in poverty an Luzhin seemed as the light at the end of the tunnel, Dounia and the whole family refused to humilliate themselves despite the economic benefit, which we are so ingrained to pursue.

While Razumihin symbolized the hope in humanity to some extent, Svidrigailov represented human decay that brought him to an (unexpected) suicide. 

Tbh I was strangely drawn and identified (without his homicidal tendencies of course haha) to the character of Raskolnikov, his thought process and the way his mind works in a whirlwind relates a lot me as an over-thinker. 

In conclusion, I firmly believe that the environment can have a lot of influence when breeding such criminals, specially when loneliness and depression play a major role in the life of a person. However, one should constantly fight for human dignity no matter the odds and circumstances. 

Anyway, I thoroughly enjoyed the novel and will surely add more of Dostoyevsky to my queue (maybe Karmazov Brothers).

Favorite quotes: 

""Mere existance had always been too little for him; he had always wanted more. Perhaps it was just for the strength of his desires that he had thought himself a man to whom more was permissible than others.""

""But why are they so fond of me if I don¬¥t deserve it? Oh, if I only were alone and no one loved me and I too had never loved anyone! Nothing of this would have happened.""

I think that until that point Raskolnikov realized his extreme selfishness, compared to the way his sister, mother and Razumihin literally strived for his well being. And in some sense cowardice of falling to the ""environment"" and inability to take control of his life (maybe this is why he felt he wasnt so unique after all).  

Extra: The subtle notes of xenophobic and antisemitic views of Russian society at that time can be noted by the characters¬¥ negative opinions on Germans and Poles. Including the prejudices of Jewish people (money hoarders, leeches and facial features).",books,2913

The change in the two audiences was really refreshing since the other books I‚Äôve read recently gave off a childish tone. It was suggested to me because I really liked Outerbanks and I heard it was a little similar with the pogues/kooks storyline so I gave it a read. It was one of the best books I‚Äôve ever read. In fact, it‚Äôs probably my favorite book. I love how it came full circle in the end and it showed the transitioning of Ponyboys morals after Dally‚Äôs death and then again after talking to Sodapop.

"Has anyone else read this book? It's been on my reading list for years, since I appreciated Charlie Jane Anders's work as an editor for io9. But now that I've finally read it, it's had a definite emotional effect on me that I don't fully understand.

  I don't want to spoil the book or anything like that, just to figure out my feelings. Maybe it's because of the toll that quarantine, and COVID, and the violent police response to the Black Lives Matter protests have had on my psyche. Maybe it's because the descriptions of neglectful families and childhood bullying were descriptive enough to bring up some really sharp memories. It's entirely likely that I was just in a vulnerable headspace and should have looked up more about the story before starting to read.

  But, I just found myself crying at the very last section of the story. And not cathartic, emotional tears, but almost bitter ones, like at the end of a relationship you didn't think was over. The ending is what it is, and I'm on my phone so I can't add spoilers all that easily, but it felt like it was too late? And everything that was happening in the narrative was hurtling towards this fatalism that I can't really verbalize.

  There were times where the plot felt almost breathless, and there were some tense moments that actually got my heart pounding in ways that other books haven't done for me in a while. But the way the story ends has got me feeling the way people describe the end of a Cormac McCarthy novel. I haven't been this drained and forlorn at the end of a book in what feels like forever. And I don't think/know by if that might be the case for anyone else who's read it.

  I know this is a *good* book. And let me say that again, *All the Birds in the Sky* is a good story. But maybe I just picked a bad time to read it, and now I'm feeling slightly broken or something.

"Normally I don't read romance novels as much, but I saw a trailer on YouTube for a new Amazon show based on this novel, and I thought I might just give a try just for the fun of it, since I had just finished another book anyway.



I found this book to be surprisingly thought provoking. Usually there's this trope that romance is cheesy or whatever, but beyond the romance there were insightful lessons about humility and empathy. One of the things that stuck out was how the narrator realized that he was a side character to the story. The fact that main character of the novel is a blip in a larger, unrelated story about someone else was an intriguing choice.



I've read some reviews bashing the book for being insensitive about PTSD and trauma, and while I understand some of the anger, I think some of it is unwarranted. The book is written from the perspective of a naive, teenage boy who doesn't know how to deal with trauma and death. I think Sutherland made the right choice of sticking with the perspective of Henry instead of trying to be politically correct 100% of the time, even if it came off as insensitive to some people.

"Just earlier today, I finished the Inheritance Cycle for the third time. It has been probably a couple years since I've read it, and I simply adore these books. Something about the world that has been built has me aching for more, and I have absolutely fallen in love with Eragon, Saphira, Arya, Roran, Nasuada, and Orik. Recently, I've also had the joy of being able to experience Andrzej Saprowski's world of the Witcher, and I hope to read these books as well. I've loved Tolkien's world since I was a kid; so much so that I have a Lord of the Rings tattoo, so seeing these great books in the same vein of fantasy is a great joy. I was wondering what some of y'all thought of the Inheritance Cycle, and also wondering what other fantasy books or series y'all have had the joy of reading.",books,790

"tl:dr: musing about productive and counter productive reading challenges. What are some reading challenges you‚Äôve participated in and how did they affect your reading?

So I do the reading challenge where you choose a number of books to read each year. Last year I read 37 books according to Goodreads, although some of those are really short stories, essays and non fiction books I read for work. So this year I set the challenge at 50.

This has had the unfortunate effect of stressing me out. LOL. I was in a reading slump jan-feb, and didn‚Äôt pick up pace until April. Since then, the stressful thought of falling behind has made me read short books, graphic novels and fast paced mass market books. It wouldn‚Äôt be a problem except for the fact that I choose not to engage in longer books, reasoning that if it drags I loose valuable time. I‚Äôm actually 6 books ahead of schedule now, and I just picked up a more challenging book for the first time in months. 

So although I will finish this challenge, I have decided that next year I will challenge myself to only read 12 books, and to really engage in each and every single one of them.

A thing I do challenge myself to do though, that really works for me, is to make reading notes when I read non fiction. I underline my reading, occasionally jotting down notes in the margins. After I‚Äôve finished, I use a special reading log, to comment on my thoughts, and what I gained from my reading. It really gives meaning, makes me feel like I‚Äôve gained something, and helps me to focus.

So; what reading challenges do you participate in, and how do they affect your reading? What do you experience as productive and counterproductive? Is there any reading challenge you would want to participate in?",books,1750
"I've just about finished *On Writing* by Stephen King, and I struggle to understand where the praise for the book stems from. It's not a bad book, let me just say that, but it's really self-indulgent when it comes to the writing advice. Here are some of my main criticisms.

1. The first part of the book is great. Basically a mini-autobiography that focuses on King's childhood and early adulthood right up to the point where he ""made it"" (i.e. sold *Carrie*). I found this to be far and away the best part of the book. The section was clearly written from memory with little to no research, because King often alludes to details that may or may not be different from what he remembers. It's a great text, because it's King's straightforward answer to why he became the writer he is and an account on his life as he remembers it.
2. After that, the book becomes a bit of the mess in terms of structure. Initially, I thought this was by design, but reading up on the history of it, I found out that King abandoned the book multiple times (once because of his accident) before finishing it. The irony here is that you can tell why King advises to finish writing the first draft of a book in three months. The structure doesn't really get in the way of the book's message, but you get the feeling that there was a more clever structure to it given the first chapter titles such as ""C.V."" and ""Toolbox"".
3. This is surely unfair criticism to some degree, but I'll say it regardless - you'll have a great deal of King's novels ruined by reading this book. There's a very detailed section on *The Stand* which gives away a key plot point and the entire motivation behind the ending.
4. The core of the book, i.e. the advice to aspiring writers, is really not much more than a disguised writer's autobiography. The chapters usually start out with general writing advice and then just end up with personal anecdotes. These are all insightful to some degree, but by the time you finish certain sections of the book, you wonder what exactly King is trying to tell you.
5. In defense of this part of the book, it's definitely not light on advice. King takes you through most of the important aspects of writing, gives you his opinion on it, and usually lists some examples of good and bad writing. So if you read this book specifically for that (and maybe are willing to take notes), you'll get something out it. Just don't expect him to re-invent the wheel or even offer a 'complete' view on the craft.
6. Not as much criticism as a funny observation, but I never heard of 90% of the authors King cites as established authors. Maybe they're mostly genre writers, I don't know.

In essence, I think *On Writing* is a decent book, but one that should be regarded as an autobiography first and foremost. It's more on the motivational than the educational side of things.",books,2858

I love reading and it's something I cherish greatly. It's just that sometimes the world inside the books I read seems so vast compared to what we live in today, which makes me want to put the book down because I don't want to get sucked up into it.

I also tend to read fantasy books and I love dystopian novels, which kind of ends up creating a world that is beyond the limits of our own right now. Kinda makes me sad to think that I can live in that type of world.

"My habits are perhaps a bit extreme.

In the introduction to this book, the author mentions ""The Boys of Summer"", a sports classic about the Jackie Robinson-era Brooklyn Dodgers.  Now I don't go for sports books, but the label ""classic"" proves irresistible, so I go down one more rabbit-hole.

"Just stayed up all night finishing The Wind Up Bird Chronicle and I have to say it's a great book but I had such a hard time identifying themes and messages Murakami was trying to convey. 

For example, I noticed that there was something coming out of each character and that either the well or Nobody Wataya that triggered it but I had no idea what was coming out or what it coming out represents. My initial thought was that it was the soul of each person being exposed and their true selves coming to light but after reading a couple posts here I realized that it was definitely the id.

I also had no idea what the mark on Okada's face, the guy Cinnamon saw, and the vet represented. I was thinking that they were just different forms of Okada Or what the wind up bird was supposed to represent. 

For the most part I read this simply at a surface level so I feel like I wasn't able to enjoy it as much but nonetheless I still really enjoyed the story and Lt. Mamiya's background was my favorite part.

"I just finished Cormac McCarthy‚Äôs ‚ÄúAll the Pretty Horses‚Äù. Like K. A. Porter often does he sets his story in Mexico. He writes of Mexico with fondness and clarity. The plot encompasses events during the Mexican Revolution of 1910 to 1920 especially the Ten Days. The warning of the treachery of military leader Huerta unheeded by the President. The death of the President‚Äôs brother, who gave the warning, at the hands of a mob. They removed his glass eye and passed it around. That they also removed his good eye is perhaps McCarthy‚Äôs elaboration. That they were capable of that is not in question.

Cruelty and kindness of men. Indifference of nature. Honor to self and loyalty to friend. Honesty in dealings with men and nature. Nobility and utility of horses. Love of war and greed for riches fuels cycle upon cycle of history making it a kind of fate easy to believe in. Children happy in ignorance of the world. Sweet and sorrowful longing of a man for a woman. Obstacles of class, language, education, nature and man itself.  

The writing style, themes and subjects are very like Hemingway. Which I like very much.  

The character of Jimmy Blevins drives much of the story as the actions of wind and sea steer the course of a sailing ship. More of an agent of fate then an actual human he has no true name or origin and even a more thoroughly idealistic notion of right and wrong and the choices available in a situation then John Grady.  

John Grady is the author‚Äôs perfect man; his ideal human imagined as patient, thoughtful, intelligent, loyal to friends and kind to everyone. Incapable of lying. A man in full knowledge of and respect for his talents who has derived from them skills that he seeks to put to good use in work that to him is meaningful and spiritually rewarding. A man wise enough and courageous enough to sanitize a penetrating bullet wound with the red hot muzzle of a pistol. He is the great hope.",books,1929
"Preface: most of what I say is merely introductory statements that presents what is likely already known as well as where I draw my idea from, myself. 

Skip to * if you want to read only what I wanted to share.

Like anyone who reads of Chris' life, my focus is not on his acts themselves rather the ideals behind them. 

Many consider him a foolish idealist who attempted to face the harsh Alaskan wilderness with brazen stupidity, while others admire his free nature and rejection of the traditional idea of live held today.

Taking my personal ideals and feelings into account I think I provide a slightly different view of Chris than I've seen presented so far. Sharing his distaste for ""corporate"" life, if you will, his flittering nature and romanticized view of surviving in the harsh wilderness resonate with me. 


* While his lack of preparation and flippant disregard of the brutal realities may seem as though they stem from his idealism, I think Chris fully expected to die there. I think he thought of Alaska as the endgoal of his life and went there unprepared, not as an act of stupidity or even suicide, rather to determine if he were worthy of his idealist world. If he survived, and I expect the idea was to eventually thrive there, then the harsh world of his dreams had accepted hi; if not, then he died in the land he loved and so desperately wanted to be.",books,1379

"Its verses and characters put most books that pretend to be ""literature"" to shame. There's really quite nothing like Achilles and his speeches. 

Here's one of my favorites by him that I have read over and over in my highlights. 

""For as I detest the doorways of Death, I detest the man, who hides one thing in the depths of his heart and speaks forth another. But I will speak to you the way it seems best to me: neither do I think the son of Atreus, Agamemnon, will persuade me, nor the rest of the Danaans, since there was no gratitude given for fighting incessantly forever against your enemies. Fate is the same for the man who holds back, the same if he fights hard. We are all held in a single honour, the brave with the weaklings. A man dies still if he has done nothing, as one who has done much.

"A masterpiece of subtlety and nuance, almost all of the action in this novel takes place in the minds of its characters as they contemplate their relationships to the people around them. It is written from the point of view of an omniscient narrator, heavily relying on 3rd person stream of conscience. This may be confusing for some readers unfamiliar with stream of conscience narration but it is far more accessible than the first person narration. Woolf's characters are fleshed out and inspire emotional connections in a compact package; the novel is barely over 200 pages. It works as an objective examination of how people relate to one another, the struggles in maintaining those relationships, and the celebration of those qualities that bring and keep them together. This is a great book for anyone interested in delving into the minds of complex characters or reading an author whose prose is among the best in literature.",books,933

"Today it is 2035. People are trying to avoid this chaos. On this night, robots took over our city. I'll start with the pre-history. Ten years ago, scientists invented the perfect artificial intelligence (hereinafter AI). They predicted that with robots we would live in peace and harmony. But they thought too utopian.  People were divided into two camps. Some were afraid of this, hoping that God would punish us, because we are trying to change this world without his consent. Another camp fully supported this idea, arguing that we can live perfectly, leaving everything to robots and cyborgs due to the fact that they do not feel tired and do the work indicated to them.

But five years later, the first system failure occurred. Scientists had by then invented an interdimensional engine for space shuttles. They managed to colonize Mars and make an ecosystem on it that is suitable for our life. About twenty-five percent of our population flew to Mars in search of a better life. The rest of the people were afraid of this, believing that it would be easier and more familiar to them on Earth.

Now, there're some books I enjoyed reading such as Percy Jackson and other Rick Riordan books. I've enjoyed them as stories but never got deeply immersed into it due to my disconnect with the medium. I don't think it's inferior to other mediums.

I don't know if my distaste for books comes from me loving movies, tv shows, anime, manga, comic books. I enjoy and resonate with those mediums a lot more because of the presentation, artwork, voice acting, animation, cinematography, etc...

However, it does get annoying when people keep telling me to read more books and calling me lazy for not wanting to read them when I already tried it and decided that it's not for me.

"Welcome to our weekly recommendation thread!  A few years ago now the mod team decided to condense the many ""suggest some books"" threads into one big mega-thread, in order to consolidate the subreddit and diversify the front page a little.  Since then, we have removed suggestion threads and directed their posters to this thread instead.  This tradition continues, so let's jump right in!

 **The Rules**

 * Every comment in reply to this self-post must be a request for suggestions.

 * All suggestions made in this thread must be direct replies to other people's requests. Do not post suggestions in reply to this self-post.

 **How to get the best recommendations**

 The most successful recommendation requests include a description of the kind of book being sought.  This might be a particular kind of protagonist, setting, plot, atmosphere, theme, or subject matter.  You may be looking for something similar to another book (or film, TV show, game, etc), and examples are great!  Just be sure to explain *what* you liked about them too.  Other helpful things to think about are genre, length and reading level.

 All Weekly Recommendation Threads are linked below the header throughout the week to guarantee that this thread remains active day-to-day.  For those bursting with books that you are hungry to suggest, the suggested sort is new; you may need to do this manually if your app or settings means this does not happen for you.

 If this thread has not slaked your desire for tasty book suggestions, we propose that you head on over to the aptly named subreddit /r/suggestmeabook.

Paid for Jane Fallon's recent book 'Queen Bee'. It was..... OK. My main gripe is the fact that neither Jane or her editors managed to spot the name change of a character. Things like this pull me out of the immersion. Does nobody proofread any more?? What exactly do editors do?? How do I become one since they fuck up the simplest of things.,books,342

I‚Äôve searched everywhere but can‚Äôt find anything that isn‚Äôt over $60 or incredibly fishy. Any help is appreciated. It was published in the 50s and the author died not long after so it should be public domain. It should also be the green version with &gt;200 pages and not the orange abridged version.",books,374
"I sat down and read this book for the second time yesterday, from cover to cover in about 6.5 hours. I first read it when I was 14, so ten years ago. I never realised just how profoundly brilliant it is as a novel the first time I read it, so I really enjoyed seeing it with an adult perspective on the themes. I think I‚Äôm going to write an essay on it about the way it approaches miscarriages of justice. Super interesting.",books,424
"From [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23444482-the-traitor-baru-cormorant):

&gt;Tomorrow, on the beach, Baru Cormorant will look up from the sand of her home and see red sails on the horizon.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
The Empire of Masks is coming, armed with coin and ink, doctrine and compass, soap and lies. They'll conquer Baru‚Äôs island, rewrite her culture, criminalize her customs, and dispose of one of her fathers. But Baru is patient. She'll swallow her hate, prove her talent, and join the Masquerade. She will learn the secrets of empire. She‚Äôll be exactly what they need. And she'll claw her way high enough up the rungs of power to set her people free.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
In a final test of her loyalty, the Masquerade will send Baru to bring order to distant Aurdwynn, a snakepit of rebels, informants, and seditious dukes. Aurdwynn kills everyone who tries to rule it. To survive, Baru will need to untangle this land‚Äôs intricate web of treachery - and conceal her attraction to the dangerously fascinating Duchess Tain Hu.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
But Baru is a savant in games of power, as ruthless in her tactics as she is fixated on her goals. In the calculus of her schemes, all ledgers must be balanced, and the price of liberation paid in full.

"I've always enjoyed literature from a young age (it taught me to read; English is my 2nd language), but I was wondering how many people grew up with no interest in books or reading at all, only changing their mind later in life.   


Maybe there was that one book a friend recommended that you started thinking it wouldn't be interesting, but it made a reader of you in the end?",books,378
"So my girlfriend can‚Äôt read books without knowing the ending, else it keeps her up or she can‚Äôt ‚Äúnot read‚Äù the book until she gets to the ending. So what she does is look up the plot synopsis online, then finds out how the entire story unfolds, and then reads the book.

So what do you think? Acceptable book etiquette or no?",books,325
"This may actually be two separate books but I'll try to describe it/them the best I can.

This book was around approximately 15 years ago and it may be older as I just picked it up from a library.

Here's a short description of what I can remember.

The book started in outer space, the protagonist/protagonists then crash landed on an alien planet. The book carried on and the first characters encountered an alien insectoid like race. Then I can't remember if there was a conflict of sorts or not, I think there was but it was resolved. This book may be one of a series, I can't remember.

That's about all I can remember. Thanks for any help anyone can be!",books,659
"I was an avid reader in high school. I read a lot of the classics in high school, was in honors English, had a high reading level, etc. I'm 24 now and I've been getting back into reading. I'm currently like 30 pages into the first Wheel of Time book and I feel like I am not retaining anything. Like the words are there, I'm reading them but I'm not processing them. I've never had an issue reading when I did read, I was a big fan of Hemingway in high school. 

So is reading a use it or lose it skill?",books,503
"Just finished True Grit by Charles Portis. Actually, I read it twice in 3 days because I enjoyed it so much. 

I like westerns very much but have felt discouraged in the past because it is such a male-dominated genre, both in authors and characters. Not only is the protagonist a young girl, but she, Mattie Ross, is a strong-willed, capable and childish character. A very believable combination. She is confident in everything she says and does, sometimes foolishly but unabashedly so. Only in hindsight does she reflect matter of factly on her mistakes. She is complex and multi-faceted. She exists so perfectly in the world that I feel sad I can‚Äôt read more about her. 

I also watched the Coen brothers 2010 remake and while it is a great film and stays true to the book, it simply cannot capture the voice and vitality of  Mattie Ross. I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôd never read it before. It meets all the qualifications of a good western - murder, revenge, gun fights, snakes, etc. It is also based in an accurate historical context and I appreciate that attention to detail. 10/10, highly recommend.",books,1095
"I spent most of my life reading almost exclusively nonfiction, but have ventured out to reading some novels and found myself a big fan of YA dramas like John Green and Rainbow Rowell do. 

I really love those books but so much of those books seem foreign to me they always seem to deal with young beautiful people with their whole lives ahead them. I was wondering if there was books with those general themes like love, friendship, self identity, and sorrow but dealt with people who face real adult difficulties like poverty, drug addiction, isolation, and mental illness from people who might be ugly, sick, old, etc. 

Maybe something like fan girl combined with the more punk parts of neuromancer  or Burrough's junkie. Maybe the majority of people that fit into these identities aren't big readers or writers. Most of the other criminals, mentally ill, and people on the margins of society I've been friendly with find it strange people read voluntarily outside of school or jail/prison.

Anyways have any of you experienced this trouble or have any recommendations for me?

Thanks in advance and sorry for any serious errors.",books,1132
"I just finished Twilight and I have to say, what an absolute piece of garbage. The main reason I disliked this book so strongly is because the plot is so dragged out for so long the conflict takes place exactly at 74.8% of the way through the book. There's no story! Maybe if she made the book about 700 pages I'd be ok with prolonging the conflict because there would actually be a reason to care about these characters and their motivations. I have never in my life read a book so dry and lacking, Even kids books have more content. There's nothing more annoying than reading filler for 400 pages just to get to 50 pages of the actual A plot.",books,644
"I just finished this book, and suffice to say, I wept. The prose was immaculate, its beautiful and morose tone shaping the landscape and story together in a truly masterful way. I have read few books that have moved me so profoundly. 

After finishing it, as I usually do with books that I really enjoy, I read reviews of other readers to get a glimpse into what others thought of it, what interpretations they had, etc.

I was very surprised to find out that many people weren't only nonplussed by this book, but truly hated it. They either complained of the story going nowhere, or of the prose lacking any sort of imagination, which I wholly disagree with. I was riveted by this novel, completely engrossed in each page as I voraciously tore through it in one sitting.

Rather than become consumed by my disgust of the large mass of people who didn't understand the work in the same way I did, I had the following thought: many great works of art, literary or otherwise, tend to polarize people. From Picasso to The Beatles to Hemingway, all canonical in their own right, there are many people who just seem to love to hate it. 

What are some other books that fit this description for you in the same way? I'd love to hear if anyone shares or completely disagrees with this sentiment.",books,1288
"A while ago I read *Crime and Punishment* and found Dostoevsky's exploration of a mentally disturbed man's psyche very disturbing, both because of how empathetically it was written and because of what I saw of myself Raskolnikov.

I am wondering whether there is a similarly well-written book that delves deep into the psychology of someone without obvious delusions and distorted ways of thinking. Specifically, I am looking for a novel whose primary focus is the character's psyche, rather than a relationship or greater external conflict (although these elements may exist in the background).",books,595
"Secret Seven, Famous Five, The Magic Faraway Tree....just thinkin bout them brings tears to my eyes. They literally make up my childhood. I wasnt an attentive student in school, but Enid Blyton expanded my English knowledge so far to the point, that teachers would put me on par with Year 11-12s when i was in yr 8. I remember we had this award for the student who checked out the most books in the school year, and i won it every. single. year. Im talkin 350-400 books per year. Hard to believe. i know. but Enids style of writing just captured my heart, and tbh, shes the reason i ever started reading in the first place. We had this mall nearby where we lived, and they held a book fair every month or so, where they sold used books for around $1-2, and my dad and i wld stock up on around 20 books every time, and i would spend DAYS just reading and reading and reading. I remember this one story that rlly stuck, i completely forgot what its called, shld be sumwhere in my bookshelf, but it was about that horse with s white star on her forehead. I dunno i just thought it was a rlly wholesome story back then. And The Famous Five. God, id kill to have adventures like dat w ma mates. U have authors like J.K. Rowling, who created the Potterverse (as i like to call it). But Blyton created worlds upon worlds upon worlds. Seriously, she has so many noticeable series, its insane. Wish i clda met her.

Once upon a time I was assigned **The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier ans Clay** for a summer assignment. It got good reviews, so I figured it was worth the several hundred page read.

I need help getting this damn book out of my head so that I can go back to real life and focus on some time sensitive matters.

"My mother recently bought a book called ‚Äò of love and other demons‚Äô. He is her favourite author and this was the only book at indigo, I personally haven‚Äôt read it but the synopsis makes it sound like somewhat if a romance novel. I even searched up the genre and it was under romance and had much less controversy than Lolita. 

I‚Äôm not going to judge yet as I haven‚Äôt read the book and I‚Äôve only read the synopsis and some random pages. For those of you who have indeed read the book, would you say it glorifies pedophilia? 

Personally, the difference I see is that the author explicitly said Lolita was more of a horror novel than anything. And there are little ways it shows you that it‚Äôs not beautiful at all and it‚Äôs not a love story since her name isn‚Äôt even Lolita and it‚Äôs just his little ‚Äúpet‚Äù name for her. 

I would love to hear your opinions on this novel, don't worry I love spoilers.",books,897
"Hello:

I'm new here and I had a question. I'm thinking of a historical / adventure novel, I think from the 1970s, where the protagonist is a Holocaust survivor who's hunting Nazis. I skimmed the early chapters once, years ago. 

All I really remember from it is   
a) when someone's talking to the protagonist and noticing that his accent doesn't quite match up to his assumed name, that person realizes that he can't place his accent and that the guy looks like he could be from any European country from Britain to the Urals (or a similarly vast sweep of terrain)

b) the protagonist is reading a work of Spanish pornography entitled *Org√≠as de Budapest* (""Orgies of Budapest"") and realizes one has to achieve a working fluency in a language to read smut in it.",books,764
"Has anyone else had the chance to read the book? To me, it was a cross between ‚ÄúRebecca‚Äù and ‚ÄúCrimson Peak‚Äù. It starts off slowly, but Moreno-Garcia is very good at creating a foreboding atmosphere until the book‚Äôs big twists are revealed. It was interesting that the so-called ‚Äúhaunted house‚Äù at the center of the story was an English manor built by a wealthy English family who moved to Mexico to start a silver mining business and the book made several references to labor exploitation and eugenics.",books,502
"What a friend said has struck a chord in me, said he no longer has interest in novels or story books, he now solely read nonfiction.

He said, ""well, I got nothing from reading novels anyway""

I kept quiet and change the subject, but the remarks annoy me, and the words keep repeating in my head distracting me from the book I currently reading, making me asks myself ""what do I get from reading this?""

I hate that I can't answer this myself other than ""it makes me happy and provide a momentary escapism"" but I can't even convince myself.


No hate for nonfictions, it's just what he said that bothers me.

"I read the book, ‚ÄúSame Kind of Different as Me‚Äù by Ron Hall and Denver Moore with Lynn Vincent, a few weeks ago. I have to say that I was sobbing like crazy towards the end! 
This book is based on a true story, and a must read. 

Today, I mentally got prepare to watched the movie that was made in 2017. I have no regrets watching it, but I wished the movie was as phenomenal as the book. There was soooo much plot left out, especially the people involved in the novel.",books,469
"I was thinking about how a lot of times we recommend books on this thread and engage in discussions about how great they are, but also a lot of us have a long book list that maybe we don't talk about as much.  


Last year, I read *Anna Karenina* because I'd always heard how fantastic Tolstoy was, and I wanted to save *War and Peace* until later (silly, I know). Anyway, I spent a few days getting through *Anna Karenina* and kept hoping for it to get better. It did not. Not only did I waste all that time reading it, I now am hesitant to start *War and Peace* because I""m afraid that it too will turn out to be a disappointment.  


I realize everyone has different tastes and what may be my least favorite book is thousands of people's favorite. However, if we talk about books we love to read... maybe also we should talk about some that we utterly do not recommend?

"My favorite part of Stephen King's IT isn't the horror or adventure, but the beautiful childhood friendship and emotion. Playing in the creek, building a dam, helping each other deal with the horror of IT and the troubles of their normal lives.

After that, I picked up another and just couldn‚Äôt bring myself to finish it. There just wasn‚Äôt that element to the story that made me want to continue on. I like novels that have a certain ‚Äúgoal‚Äù or at least an interesting element of suspense.

"I don't post often and I'm on mobile so do with that info as you will.

Today I finished the audio book of The Song of Achilles by Madeline Miller. I listened to Circe first, and thought it was excellent. 

At first, I felt the same way about TSOA. Amazed at the wonderful prose, enthralled by the beautiful descriptions of the landscapes and interactions between the various characters. I pretty much loved it--until I got to the ending.

The final 30 minutes (no idea what that is in page numbers) absolutely pissed. Me. Off. I'm pretty much disgusted and feel like I wasted my time even begininng TSOA.

Here is why. (Once again, I listened to the audio books so I don't really know the spellings of the character names)  &gt;! At the end, Brisea, one of the most sympathetic supporting characters, is killed by Achilles' cruel son Neoptolamus. Already, I was absolutely furious at that. I honestly felt emotionally whiplashed that you would put a character through so much just to kill them off at the END of the story anyway.

So that pissed my off, but I kept going. What really did it for me was the final interactions between Thetis and Patroclus, where it's revealed more or less that Thetis wanted Achilles to be godlike because she wanted him to be greater than his father, Peleas, who had raped her to birth Achilles. 

But, hold on. So, you kill off one of the most sympathetic characters in the whole story, and NOW you suddenly want me to empathize with Thetis? Who is the absolute WORST (trying to avoid profanity) throughout the story, who is SO awful to Patroclus, insufferable, horrible Thetis? 

Nah, sorry. You lost me. I don't care what happened to her, i cannot sympathize with her. That, plus Achilles himself proving to be a selfish jerk who cared about his reputation above everything else just did it for me. !&lt;

Didn't care anymore after that. I'm throwing the baby out with the bathwater on this one.

Out of all the ways Miller could have ended the story, I was very disappointed with the way she chose to do it.

I'm in in the minority here, so let me know what you think.",books,2106
"Hi all.

Like many, I used to read physical paperbacks, then I switched to Kindle a couple of years ago. Pros-cons of each are well-discussed online, but I'm wondering specifically about the retention aspect. How much do you retain per medium?

I personally feel like I retain more of what I read from physical books, but that's hardly evidence. I also actually don't want that to be true, because I love the convenience of the Kindle and am on a mission to go digital anyway (got an iPad for PDFs, too).

"So I know this book was super popular not even a few months ago, but I just recently finished reading it and my god did I weep.  Everything about it was just so emotional at the end, and I felt as if though I wasn't appreciative enough of my own life (my loving family, my stable house, my predictably comfortable future).

"On 4chan there's three books that always get referenced: Ulysses by Joyce, Gravity's Rainbow by Pynchon and Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace. They get referenced because each of them is a long, rather complex novel and each uses experimental writing technique.               

A couple years ago I made it a goal to read all of them (at least before I die) and was initially nervous because the amount of effort seemed like it was rather high. The good news is that: It wasn't! It was actually relatively easy to read the books and the plots of all of them were quite good! I've always read quite a bit but the departure from short, low-risk books into literary doorstoppers was a lot better than I initially expected. On top of learning quite a bit about the world, I got to experience some of the most vivid depictions of ridiculous things I've ever tried to visualize. Monkeys running wild, a giant erection splitting the clouds, a cyclops in an Irish bar, a kid with his tongue stuck to a window, a group of wheelchair assassins and so much more.                        

The realm of fantasy could not compete with books that are both hyper-real and cartoonishly fantastic. I'm so glad I managed to reach this goal and had to brag a bit.",books,1247

But after a Christmas-gifted book from an aunt I love came into my life, I've found a new dilemma: wanting to finish a book I wouldn't personally choose to. 

Do you, dear person reading this, have any advice on how to do something faster than speed-reading, getting the plot without much of the detail? In college I passed most of my older-English classes leaning heavily on online summaries, and that always worked pretty well as at least giving me the ability to keep up in discussions and as something solid enough to build the basis of many mediocre essays.

"I was always an avid reader growing up, but fell off the wagon in recent years, sometimes only reading one or two books in an entire year. 

This year, I really wanted to read 20 books, and today, I achieved my goal :) 

Here are the books I read this year, with some notes and my rating for them. Also, I am a big ass crybaby so I'll note if I cried or not after reading the book. 

1. **A Dance with Dragons, George R.R. Martin -** 4/5 stars. When the fuck is the next one coming out??????? That's what I want to know. Did I cry? Yes. 
2. **Save Me the Plums, Ruth Reichl -** 4/5 stars. I'm a big foodie, so I really enjoyed this book. Also, I was hungry any time food was described, so if you are going to read this, make sure you do it on a full stomach. Did I cry? No. 
3. **The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, Shaffer and Barrows**  \- 3/5 stars. I found the format to be interesting, but the book ended up being super tedious and I had a hard time getting through it. Did I cry? Yes, but only because I'm a crybaby bitch 
4. **Know My Name, Chanel Miller** \- 4/5 stars. A fantastic book that was super emotional for me. I really enjoyed it, but the last few chapters seemed repetitive to me. Did I cry? Yes. 
5. **The Clockmaker's Daughter, Kate Morton** \- 2.5/5 stars. I enjoyed it, but the ending seemed really silly sooooooo I am giving it 2.5 stars. Did I cry? No. 
6. **The Tea Girl of Hummingbird Lane, Lisa See -** 4.5/5 stars. So beautiful, at times a little predictable/cheesy, but I enjoyed it thoroughly. This book is what got me on my Lisa See kick. I ended up reading a bunch of books from her this year because of this one. Did I cry? Yes. 
7. **Snow Flower and the Secret Fan, Lisa See** \- 4/5 stars. About two girls in China who become ""laotong"" or sworn sisters. Really beautiful story and the writing is excellent. Did I cry? No.
8. **Calypso, David Sedaris** \- 4/5 stars. Really funny, but I had a hard time getting into it. The story about the turtle and the tumor had me rolling. Honestly, the only reason why I read this book was because I read this review on goodreads: ""On the inside of this book, David Sedaris signed it and wrote, ""Joe, I am so happy you're alive."" He then proceeded to write in my girlfriend at the time's book, ""You can do better."" Did I cry? No.
9. **Evvie Drake Starts Over, Linda Holmes** \- 2/5 stars. Boring, predictable, and...boring. Basically two people meet and fall in love and that's the whole book with nothing interesting about it whatsoever. Easily the worst book I read this year. I had to force myself to finish it. Did I cry? No.
10. **Olive Kitteridge, Elizabeth Strout** \- 4/5 stars. Good, but I had a hard time getting through it. Did I cry? No.
11. **Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, J.K. Rowling** \- 5/5 stars. Re-read, Harry Potter is my favorite series.  Did I cry? No.
12. **Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, J.K. Rowling** \- 5/5 stars. Re-read, Harry Potter is my favorite series.  Did I cry? No.
13. **Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, J.K. Rowling** \- 5/5 stars. Re-read, Harry Potter is my favorite series.  Did I cry? No.
14. **On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous, Ocean Vuong** \- 5/5 stars. Absolutely stunning book that talks about a lot of hard topics, and I highly recommend this book to everyone. Did I cry? Yes. 
15. **Exhalation, Ted Chiang** \- 4/5 stars. A gorgeous collection of short stories. The first story was so breathtakingly beautiful that I had to put the book down for a while to ponder it. Some of the stories were just okay, but overall, a really enjoyable collection. Did I cry? No.
16. **My Dark Vanessa, Kate Elizabeth Russell** \- 4.5/5 stars. As a sexual abuse survivor, this book was incredibly difficult to read. I had a really hard time putting it down even though it made me feel like shit. However, it's incredibly captivating and well-written. Did I cry? Yes. 
17. **The Henna Artist, Alka Joshi** \- 4.5/5 stars. I really loved this book and I highly recommend it. Did I cry? Yes.
18. **The Sun is Also a Star, Nicola Yoon** \- 2.5/5 stars. Two horny teenagers (one of which is about to be deported) meet and spend a day together being horny teens and finding meaning where it doesn't exist. Waaaay too cliche and unrealistic. The writing was just okay, and I felt like it was 3x longer than it had to be. I was shocked at the good reviews on goodreads. Did I cry? No.
19. **Shanghai Girls, Lisa See** \- 4/5 stars. Did I cry? No.
20. **Dreams of Joy, Lisa See** \- 4/5 stars. This book is the second part to Shanghai Girls and is about life in China during the Great Leap Forward. Some of the descriptions... yikes. I had a hard time getting through some parts. But at the end, I got the happy ending that I hoped for. A little cliche, a little unrealistic, a little bit too long, but overall really enjoy Lisa See's writing style and this book was lovely. Did I cry? Yes.

"I just finished ""Naked"" and am now reading ""Me Talk Pretty One Day."" I am in agreement with what most people say - it's humorous, engaging, well-written, interesting. But a lot of the comments I've seen are about his mother with people calling her ""compelling"" and their favorite character. What the hell am I missing? Just based off of ""Naked,"" she seemed to be an unhappy housewife, kind of reminded me of Vivi from ""Divine Secrets of a Ya-Ya Sisterhood,"" always waving a cigarette or drink around with zingers ready for her husband.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Unemployed recent college graduate Ruby is forced to move back in with her parents, into the rent-free but dismal basement apartment of a posh NYC building where her father, Martin, is the superindendent. The events of the novel take place in one day.

Ruby's oldest friend, Caroline, the trust fund daughter of the building‚Äôs penthouse resident, is throwing a party that evening in the penthouse.  Growing up, Ruby saw both worlds: Martin's, and Caroline's.  Martin's growing resentment of the rich and condescending residents whom he serves manifests itself as the voice of a recently deceased resident, the politically strident anti-capitalist Lily.  In Martin's thoughts, the voice of Lily attributes Martin's fraught relationship with his daughter to the class inequity between his family and the residents, particularly to Caroline.

A homeless woman claiming to be Lily‚Äôs cousin appears in the building foyer.  Martin asks her to leave the premises.  Ruby finds this act heartless, further straining her relationship with Martin.  Later, Ruby sees that the homeless woman is still in the foyer, so Ruby lets her inside the building.  When Ruby tells this story to Caroline, Caroline exclaims that they should help the woman and enlist the help of her friend Andy, a trust fund beneficiary and photographer who takes artistic photos of homeless people.

That afternoon, through Caroline's contacts, Ruby has an interview for her dream job at the Museum of Natural History.  Martin, during a house call to the penthouse to fix a door, learns from Caroline that the job is sctually an unpaid internship. He tosses a stone for Caroline to catch, but instead it lands in her coffee mug and shatters it.  After the interview, Ruby, disappointed at discovering that there is no paying job being offered, takes a walk and bumps into Andy.  Andy invites Ruby into his home and offers her money to pose with a rhino head.  While posing, Andy gropes Ruby, but Ruby smashes Andy with the rhino head, sending him to the bathroom to clean up his bloody nose.  Ruby escapes with the rhino head and abandons it at the Museum of Natural History.

Caroline confronts Ruby about the incident with Andy, defending Andy‚Äôs version of events.  Caroline also tells Ruby that Martin ‚Äúfreaked out‚Äù on her, but promises not to report Martin to her father.  Later that evening, Ruby attends Caroline‚Äôs party, and sees  Andy, who demands the return of the rhino head.  Ruby demands the promised payment for modelling with the rhino head.  Ruby takes Andy‚Äôs wallet from his pocket and leaves the party.

Ruby returns home and Ruby and Martin both listen to an answering machine message from the property management company, apopleptic at Martin‚Äôs incident with Caroline and the stone.  Martin will be fired and kicked out of the rent-free basement apartment.  Ruby is incensed that Caroline broke her promise to not report the incident.  Ruby goes to the penthouse to confront Caroline, where she finds Caroline and Andy on the roof with the homeless woman.  Andy is photographing Caroline with the homeless woman, and Caroline asks Ruby where she should stand. Ruby advises Caroline to move back a step, which causes Caroline to fall off the roof.  

In the epilogue, Caroline is injured and her friendship with Ruby is over.  Martin moved to Georgia where he works at a new job and lives in a second floor apartment.  He is content.  Ruby works as a security guard at the Museum of Natural History, and lives with room mates in Astoria.  Martin wants Ruby to move to Georgia, but Ruby wants to stay in NYC and spend the time growing up and discovering herself.",books,3809
"First of all, main thing is I live in eastern europe and bought this book from ,,prohibited books"" series. But as i have finished the book, i can assure you that everything written was relatable for me. I took it as our history. Poverty have been a part of every country's history. Really breath-taking drama. And the best part was the ending which really didnt culminate into anything. But was just a display of one of those consequences that show how to save this poor world. I wont go in details, but let me say this. I have been reading it for 3 days and it felt like my alternative reality. Now as i have finished, i can't start a new book just because im still part of that journey and really want to know what happens next. Tom was a beautiful character. Sinner but humanly beautiful. I think all of us had similar experiences with him, i think all of us have been in a dilemma of justice. And ma ? And kids? And john? They are so powerfully written characters that i think i have seen them in real life. I see them in one of us.",books,1036
I‚Äôve been wanting a new YA romance story type book to read. When I was looking at reviews online there were mixed feelings about the book.

&gt;Sometimes, however, a tragedy that possesses artistic elements of beauty crosses our lives. If these elements of beauty are real, the whole thing simply appeals to our sense of dramatic effect. Suddenly we find that we are no longer the actors, but the spectators of the play.

[This picture](https://imgur.com/a/evbWAll) seems to be the perfect symbol for the above quote. Praised as ""The Most Beautiful Suicide,"" Evelyn McHale's death shows when the shock of artistic drama exceeds the sorrow of her fatal tragedy. The media and its audience became spectators rather than sympathizers. Does this mean the highest form of beauty lacks the most basic emotion?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;To become the spectator of one's own life...is to escape the suffering of life.

I caught the irony when I was doing my post-reading quote-picking. Quite ironic of Dorian Gray to suffer so greatly when he became the literal spectator of his life (the picture). Perhaps Harry was wrong this time.

"Hello everyone,

The final discussion thread for July book club is here. Hopefully you all enjoyed this month's selection. Don't forget to join us again next month. Below you will find the discussion questions for this section.

&gt;Daniel never knew if Kay wanted him to apologize or reassure her. Either way, he always felt implicated, like there was some expectation he wasn't meeting.

* What do you think Kay wanted from Daniel? Or was it all in Daniel's mind?

&gt;All this time, he'd been waiting for his real life to begin: Once he was accepted by Roland's friends and the band made it big. Once he found his mother. Then, things would change. But his life had been happening all along, in the jolt of the orange juice on his tongue or how he dreamt in two languages, how his students' faces looked when they figured out the meaning of a new word, the wisp of smoke as he blew out his birthday candles. 

* Can you relate to this realization? 
* Where do you think Daniel's life started to go wrong?
* How has your opinion on the different characters changed over the course of the book?
* How do you feel about the ending of the book? Did it surprise you where Daniel ended up?
* Who do you think The Leavers in the title refer to?",books,1240
"I never considered myself a writer. Honestly, I never did. It's just... I had that story that unconsciously, over the years, formed in my head, but because (as I said) I'm not a writer, I didn't know what to do with it. In the beginning, I just had a slight notion that I should let it out of my mind, release it somehow, but as time went by (and the story persistently dwelled in my mind), I eventually end up with an idea of writing it down on paper. It is strange how little time passed before my ""slight notion"" turned into the urge, even less before that urge quietly slid into an obsession. And I'm not bullshitting you here. In that time, I couldn't concentrate on anything else, business or personal, because every time I contemplated about the future (plans), all I got in my mind was a blank space around the idea of ""me writing a book"". So, in early 2007, I started writing.

&amp;#x200B;

In April that year, I took two weeks off from my work. I bought a tiny laptop and went to the small village on the Adriatic coast (""am I a writer or not?"", I thought). That was the first time I tried to transfer the story from my head into the written words. And it seemed easy; I first wrote my raw thought down on paper (during the day-long walks along the shore), then at night, in my apartment, I refined those ""scratchings"" using a word-processor on my laptop. At the end of my ""holiday"", I had a notebook full of scribbles and a (merely) fifty pages long Word document. Back at home, I let the material brew for a few days, then I started reading it empty-headed, like an uninformed reader. And guess what? It wasn't just (simply) bad writing. It was embarrassing.

&amp;#x200B;

A year passed by, during which I managed to forget about the ""writing"", but the itch returned when I got fired during the global financial crisis in late 2008. I wasn't pressured to run after a new job, so I thought ""what the hell"" and started writing again. But this time it was different. It wasn't easy at all. I knew what I wanted to say and I knew how I want to say it, but I couldn't transfer this mental representation from my head into the text of any literary value. I used to stare for hours (literally) through the space on the paper where the capital letter should precede after the dot. My writing was slow, slow, so painfully slow, that in the next two years I wrote less than on my two-week Adriatic vacation. The quality was a bit better, yes, but still, it was just bad, lousy writing. 

&amp;#x200B;

In 2011 I found (what people call) a ""dream job"". In a very respectable company I was (very generously) paid to do what I would be doing anyway in my life. For the first two years, I was a real model employee, staying-off-hours-albeit-nobody-asked-me and all that, but as soon I settled down within the company hierarchy, the old, seemingly forgotten burden reared its ugly head. Once more, I forced myself to start writing, and I started (again) from scratch. At first, I wrote twice a week after the work, then every second night, but it wasn't long before I was spending every night dealing with (my old pal) long writer's blockades, ending in a few lines of meaningful text. To make things worse, as time went by I became so obsessed with my writing, that I neglected my daily job. All day through I thought about what and how I should write, while the quality of my bill-paying profession turned into a mechanical daily grind. And it was like that for years.

&amp;#x200B;

In the winter of 2017, the company fired my ass. My only thought was, ""what took them so long?""

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend's reaction to the news was supportive. She told me that I could stay living with her until I finish my book and/or find another job. I agreed to that and continue writing from her apartment, but once again it felt very different. Writing the story wasn't just plain hard anymore. It became agony. Every word I typed felt like ripping it out of my guts with a pair of pliers. Every sentence I created resulted in real, physical pain in my stomach. Writing to me was like climbing a steep mountain with a heavy rock tied on my back with no summit or end in sight. Every single day became torture, every paragraph suffering, but for some (unknown) reason I wasn't willing to stop.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, one morning, the depression came. I woke up at nine in the morning, and just lied down with my eyes closed till noon. Even then I didn't want to get out of the bed. Why? What's the point? Why getting up, when everything that awaits me is the labor of Sisyphus? Interestingly enough, soon that became the least of my worries. I was starting to suspect that I have cancer (different types, depending on the day), or that I'm dying. One day while riding on the bus, through the window I saw a man with blood on his head, lying unconscious on the pavement. I didn't know what's going on, but I came up with an idea that police will somehow accuse me for what happened to him, charge me for the assault, trial me, and put me in jail. The funny thing was that I knew how stupid and irrational my theories were (cancer, the dying, the imprisonment), but nevertheless, they supplied me with large quantities of unbearable anxiety and excruciating fear every day. I continued with writing though, every night; and it was still a torment, but chapters actually began to take a form, and quality of written text seemed (to me) greatly improved.

&amp;#x200B;

The vast majority of (successful) suicides happen early in the morning. That is because the person (victim?) can not bear the weight of the new day. And it is true. As I mentioned (in that time, mid-2017), I was usually waking up very early in the morning, but I wasn't getting out of bed until noon. For all that ""awake time"" I contemplated how it will be the best if I just kill myself. Like on a treadmill, in my head I looped ""mental movies"" with me as a lead actor performing all kinds of successful suicide attempts, over and over again. It didn't take long before I turned from just fantasizing to actually googling the stuff and reading the countless pages about different suicide techniques on the internet. 

&amp;#x200B;

That was when I realized that I will do it. I mean, kill myself. I was just two chapters away from completing the book.

&amp;#x200B;

As a psychologist, I knew that psychiatrists and doctors cannot help me, but I went to visit one anyway. I thought they could get me some medication that will stop me from killing myself and just let me finish the book. And that was exactly what the doctor ordered. Along with a few (tasteless) jokes that were all the verbal therapy I received, I got a prescription for the famous ""selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor"". One ""happy pill"" a day, to be taken first thing in the morning before lunch, and that's it. The effect of the medication, as the doctor informed me, will (or should) be visible only after three to six weeks. But it only took ten days for a ""happy pill"" to completely demolish (ruin, annihilate) my entire organism.

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, after just a few days, I experienced total (and I mean TOTAL) sexual impotence. Contrary to the majority of people, I considered that as a positive outcome; I had one thing less to interfere with my writing. But this outcome wasn't positive at all. Impotence prevented me from getting an erection and ejaculation but didn't prevent the accumulation of the semen, which now I was unable to ""let out"" in a natural way. After five days, the pain around my crouch was so fierce that I couldn't even sit nor walk normally. Besides that, I completely lost my appetite, so I had to force myself to eat regular daily meals. I also got pathological insomnia (I haven't slept two or three days in a row, and I didn't felt tired), and I got flashes of sudden and acute sweating, with no apparent reason, that would make my underwear soaking wet.

&amp;#x200B;

After exactly ten days, on my own initiative, I have stopped taking the ""happy pill"". I was just one chapter far from completing my story.

&amp;#x200B;

Just before I started writing that last chapter, my girlfriend told me that she can not take it anymore. She can not watch me deteriorate in front of her eyes anymore. It was over. If I ever had the best thing in my life, that was her, and it was over. It also was the last piece of the puzzle that helped me finish the last chapter of my book. Now, I knew that I won't kill myself. I was sure that I won't do it because I already died. I died when she left me, and one could not die twice. I do not want to be cheap or pathetic here, but again, I'm not bullshitting you, either. I moved to my mother's apartment (after twenty years) and didn't get out of bed for a solid two weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

In February 2018, after eleven years, I finished my book. I read it out loud (just to myself), from the first page to the last, and I wasn't embarrassed. And not just that. I got the impression that I wrote the story that has never been told. For me, that was enough.

&amp;#x200B;

After 11 years of prison, I was a free man. A free man, again.

&amp;#x200B;

Epilogue:

It took me another half a year to get the book properly edited and translated, but that's a completely different horror story. 

&amp;#x200B;

After releasing the book on Kindle store I have found a new job, even better paid than the previous one. One year later, I was fired again. This time, it wasn't my fault.

&amp;#x200B;

My misery and depression weren't washed away instantly. They faded away slowly, in a couple of months, but they faded away completely. I'm not bothered with fears or anxiety anymore, at least not more than other people do. The only fear that bothers me now is fear that someday I would start writing again.",books,9803
"I‚Äôve been trying to find books on the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s for the past few weeks, but have not be able to find any recent works on the topic. The majority of the books I do find were published in 96/97, before the conflicts in the Balkans were really finished, so I am worried those ones may provide a biased or incomplete view. The more recent books published in the past 20 years are mostly just personal accounts from survivors of the Bosniak genocide. While I think those are important stories, I am more interested in learning about the wars themselves and the events that led up to them. Is the apparent lack of material due to my looking in the wrong places, or the fact that those conflicts are too recent for modern historians to begin covering? I know the rule of thumb is that one must wait at least 25 years after an event for good historical research. So I am wondering if writers and historians are still sifting through the details.",books,954

"If you don't like a book and are thinking of dnf-ing, when do you put it down? I usually try to read all the books I start, but as I've been unmotivated lately, I don't want to force myself to read when I know I'll probably never finish it and just read nothing else. 
I've started Map of Days by Ransom Riggs, and am literally 15 pages in and just want to put it down. I think if I push through it will be worth it but each time I pick it up I find it so boring and put it back down. I'm not sure whether to stop reading it as I have the next book too.

So do you finish every book you read or do you just move on to the next?",books,627
"Hi all, this is my first post in this sub-reddit. I generally love reading fiction. Especially sci-fi and fantasy, and even though I don't remember every information/the story in the books in a chronological manner, I remember the essence of the stories I have read so far because I feel that I tend to enjoy the progression of the stories that I read and I get immersed in the world of the book. For instance, the Harry Potter series, Bartimaeus trilogy, Dune saga, etc.

But, when it comes to reading non-fiction books, I get sort of anxious. Not because I feel the subject will be complicated for my understanding, but the reason for me is that, I start thinking (before I read) whether I will be able to remember all the information given in the books and later recall them if and when necessary. This also saps out the enjoyment factor associated with reading non-fiction books, even though I am very much interested in the topics.

Also, while reading ""textbooks"" during undergrad and grad years, I used to read the books and solve problems, engage in discussions, submit assigments, and gave exams based on them that re-enforced my understanding of a said subject. Unfortuanetly that is not the scenario with reading a non-fiction book where the author has spent years of her/his/their research and penned them down to make the book accessible to the general audience.

"No other book series has hooked me in from the start like this one had managed to. It's just got to be one of those 'once in a lifetime' experiences you remember fondly, reading them as they release, and growing up alongside the characters like Rowling so craftfully did. Not a single complaint about the story or characters crossed my mind as I read through them, and I loved every single one of the books.

Fuck, the final chapter made me feel like I was leaving a group of friends behind, graduating on to a new part of my own life, and leaving the future of a past I never lived. The emptiness it managed to leave behind sent me into a good book hangover for two weeks after.

"I started reading the book a week ago and I‚Äôm currently about a third in. I‚Äôm not sure if I want to continue reading.

It started off okay and I was intrigued by Ellen and the role she would obviously play throughout the book, and curious when and how Tom would finally get to build his cathedral. 

But now, a third of the way through, I hate most of the characters. Ellen‚Äôs action to have sex with Tom a mere few hours after his wife died seemed... questionable and made me a little annoyed with her, but okay. But after that I only got more sad, annoyed and angry. A lot of the men behave like frightened, egotistical, shallow idiots in my opinion, to the women and to each other. I‚Äôve had to put the book away multiple times in the past 24 hours because I just got too anxious about the rape scene (I skipped over as much as I could) and all the misfortune after that. I got especially angry after Richard first tries to protect Ariana when William and his groom rape her and then doesn‚Äôt care if she becomes a whore against her will once they‚Äôre in the city, because he‚Äôs hungry. I mean, really?

The reason I‚Äôm posting here and not just putting the book away is that I‚Äôm not sure if this is just Follett‚Äôs writing style or if the book develops into something else. I still find the premise interesting that the book follows the building of the cathedral over multiple generations and I‚Äôm curious what will happen in that regard. But I can‚Äôt stand the characters. Does the book develop into another sort of tone, or should I stop?",books,1535
"No other book series has hooked me in from the start like this one had managed to. 
It's just got to be one of those 'once in a lifetime' experiences you remember fondly, reading them as they release, and growing up alongside the characters like Rowling so craftfully did.
Not a single complaint about the story or characters crossed my mind as I read through them, and I loved every single one of the books.

Fuck, the final chapter made me feel like I was leaving a group of friends behind, graduating on to a new part of my own life, and leaving the future of a past I never lived.
The emptiness it managed to leave behind sent me into a good book hangover for two weeks after.

"Hi everyone,

Three months ago I got back into the habit of reading everyday, I have read about 7 books since then.  I decided that I am going to keep this habit up for the distant future (my whole life preferably) because it is a good habit to have. I have also decided that I am going to purchase every book I read and add it to a bookshelf in my study.  My hope is that this bookshelf will grow to be very large filled with books that I have read cover to cover.  I think it would be cool to be able to parse through the bookshelf and reminisce on what I read in years past as well as show it to people that I have over so that it could foster some good discussions.

Has anyone ever done this/what are your thoughts? Please let me know I am happy for all feedback.

May your books be good and your time be plentiful,

"Hey all

I've been truly struggling with finding a ""good"" book to read that's right up my alley. I tend to love first person narratives. I figured it might help if I mentioned a few that I really enjoyed in the past.

Recently I read Angela's Ashes by Frank McCourt, Franny and Zooey by JD Salinger, Miracle in the Andes by Nando Parrado (life-changing), The Little Girl Who Was Too Fond of Matches by Ga√©tan Soucy, and a really cool short story called ""Flowers for Algernon"" by Daniel Keyes. I thoroughly enjoyed each of these works. Somebody recommended, bases on these reads, that I try Watership Down by Richard Adams and Zeno's Conscience by Italo Svevo, both of which are failing to capture me. 

So I am really hoping somebody will introduce me to a book that I like. My all-time favorite used to be The Catcher in the Rye, but I recently re-read it and found that I only liked it because of the age at which I was exposed to it. I read it at the ""right"" time and that time for me has past. Still a great piece of work, however, and I'm sure I would appreciate something like it.",books,1086
"I read Normal People a few weeks ago and it instantly became a new favorite. I loved how it explored how sometimes you just meet someone you have such a strong connection with that no matter what happens in life they always come back to you. I also think the depiction of abuse and how that can affect a person and their future relationships was very well done. 

I‚Äôm asking if anyone has any recommendations for books similar to Normal People. Centered around young people, coming of age, and the dark parts of the human experience. Perhaps an exploration of sexuality because Normal People heavily talked about that a lot, which really interested me. 

Thanks!",books,662

I am asking because they are really obscure here where I live and seems to be popular only to the english speaking world, even tho I haven't read anything by those two and I am not interested. I was also surprised to know that a good chunk mangaka/animators where influenced by nerdy western stuff in general so I was curious.",books,607

I finished Magic Bites in a few hours because I couldn't put it down. I haven't read a book that had this effect on me in a while. The world building is fascinating and the prose is engaging which is something considering that I'm normally not a fan of first person POV. Kate herself is great. She's a badass, but actually knows when to back down. I liked how her merc persona was both a bluff and genuine. Usually authors go overboard with the whole in your face female badass thing. The side characters needed some work, but there's so much potential with them and the series as a whole. I also enjoyed the humor",books,775

"I'll try keep this short. 

My aunt is a bit of a Karen and she has an adopted African son. She pulled him out of English class because they were reading To Kill a Mockingbird which makes pretty liberal use of the N-word. The teacher insisted that its use of the N-word is important to the story, and to the historical significance of the book. 

Other great literature such as Hemingway is liberal with dated social ideas such as misogyny and whatnot. Feminist readers and writers tend to hate Hemingway (at least in my experience) for this reason. 
But with Hemingway and Lee alike, this language is a product of its time and that's just how things were back then. Rejecting them is like claiming that history never happened. Not to mention The Sun Also Rises caused American women to wear their hair short and to dress like Lady Ashley, which suggests that women at the time accepted Hemingway and he was almost like an influencer of his time.

In my list of series I also included the genre, which books I'd start with (most of the time that's the first) and how many are published atm

So does anyone think one of these series isn't worth starting bc they might not finish? Or maybe some books are also just good as standalones? Or you think the series will never finish but it's still all good so I should just read and not expect there ever to be a completion? Or maybe you read the series and you just wanna tell me it sucks and shouldn't read even if it was finished - that's also ok :)

"Sorry in advance if this isn't the right place!

I have a large collection of about 300 coffee table type photo books, ranging from around 8x10"" up to 13x17"" that I'm trying to ""organize"" and display in a set of bookcases (3 bookcases, 4 shelves each, all side-by-side. 

I would say that about 200 are between 10 and and 13"", the other 100 are 13""+ (there's a smaller set of around 50 books which are between 6-10"")

These are mostly hardcover and unfortunately a lot of ones that would normally fit together (same author or same category) vary in size quite a bit. 

To this point, I've been sorting them by size (so the 13-17"" ones at the top, the 10-13"" ones in the middle and the 6-10"" ones towards the bottom, but I'm looking to ""remodel"" them a bit and was looking for suggestions or ideas on both a functional, easy to use system but one that also looks nice. 

I've seen books sorted by spine color, size, alphabetical, by series/author, etc.. and wanted to find what worked for most people?

Since these are photo books, they're all close in genre (mostly fashion) so there's not much to split them in terms of that.

"I just want to say that I love this book, and is my absolute favorite so far!

What are your thoughts regarding Edmond and Haydee's ending?

Personally, I think their fate is intertwined, Edmond died the moment Abbe Faria accidentally placed vengeance on Edmond's heart, one would say that it is Abbe Faria who gave birth to the spirit of vengeance; the Count of Monte Cristo. It was at this moment, I think that Edmond was no longer driven by hope, but by vengeance.  The hopeful Edmond would have used the treasure for the purpose of love, Edmond had every chance to start a new life and the means to, but alas, its a different man who came out of prison, the Avenger.

Similarly, though we never really get much development with Haydee, their fates are heavily mirrored, wronged by the same man, Fernand, Haydee is stripped of everything she had and is put in chains, but as fate did with Edmond, it lent his hands to Haydee, this time in the form of the Count, instead of a Mad Priest. Haydee, too, was given a choice to start a new life, a choice that was freely given to her, but chose vengeance instead.

Both characters were at their absolute desolation, just a layer short of death, and were given another chance at life, but both choose to become instruments of fate, in a way, replacing Edmond's dark cell and Haydee's chain for another; justice or vengeance.  


I like to think that when Edmond and Haydee sailed off into the horizon is when edmond is finally free of his cell and Haydee of her chains, and finally start to really live life.",books,1554

His main character seems to be a quietly decent man, not conventionally handsome. The main women are always small and insouciant. The villain is just plain evil - no shades of gray. And all sexual interaction starts with squeezing someone's tit.

And I really do like the story lines. They're interesting. But his people are so boring and predictable. And I'm not saying I could do it better. Obviously, the man has sold a zillion more books than I have.

But I do think it's kind of lazy to imagine such a good narrative, and then just people it with such dull creatures.

"Don't judge me; it's summer and I like sitting outside with a beer and reading pulpy techno-thrillers; Crichton is a pretty good storyteller, IMO.

Prey is basically an elaboration on von Neumann's hypothetical ""grey goo"" apocalyptic scenario: scientists create autonomous replicating intelligent nanotechnology that feeds on mammals and threatens to consume the human race.

Aside from the blatant improbability of machines feeding exclusively on mammals, the book is a really well-written and exhaustively sourced exploration of the dangers of AI and nanotechnology.

However, as well-researched as it is, the book managed to miss the actual threats that AI and swarm behavior posed to modern society: instead of machines being the actual physical threat, AI was used to spread harmful memetic behavior throughout *human* populations to cause organic swarm behavior that posed in existential threat.

In our current reality, *humans* are the agents that are infected by malicious programming and *machines* were merely the medium through which it was spread, rather than the other way around as it happened in Crichton's novel.",books,1129

"I just finished Rabbit Run by John Updike, which I've picked up and put down probably six times in the past two years. It's not a long book, but it took me a long time to read because **fuck** Harry Angstrom. Spoilers follow. 

Updike is an extraordinarily talented writer. His language glows with insight, his descriptions are astute and uncommon, and his characters feel entirely human. But my god, I wish he'd picked a different protagonist. I understand that his aim was poking holes in the ""American Dream"" of his era, the standard suburban nuclear family situation, and he does it well. It's just that Harry is such a whiny, entitled, insubstantial brat that the book becomes a slog.

Sections in other POVs pulled me in and read like silk. It's not even that I like the other POV characters that much, barring Ruth--Eccles is useless dishwater and Janice is a child with no self-worth--but I could at least empathize with them.

"I‚Äôm always so focused on quantity over quality when it comes to reading. I want to slow down and actually remember a good portion of a book. It‚Äôs so easy to read something and forget it.

"'American Dirt' gained fame for being part of '[Oprah's Book Club'](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/books/american-dirt-oprah-book-club-apple-tv.html) despite controversy over the author appropriating mexican culture without being latin-american herself.

I decided to give the book a fair chance,  to see if the critics were maybe being myopic while the author functionally helped us all connect more with the plight of migrants from latin america...but nope.

Every detail in this book is cringeworthy, the amount of stereotyped dialogue is ridiculous coming from a white author, and worst of all...it's just tasteless and egregiously unauthentic. 

It's literally the white american-friendly, 'Cabo San Lucas Starbucks' version of a mexican story.

Things that I especially did not like (SPOILERS):

* The story is unrealistic and cheesy-romantic. the main character is a middle-upper class mexican housewife running away because of a fling gone wrong. not realistic gang violence, but because she  had a friendship (unknowingly) with a drug cartel kingpin who was an avid customer of a book store she owned.
* The choice to have it take place in Acapulco seemed to scream 'American tourists all heard of Acapulco!' Maybe introduce the readers to other parts of mexico? One with a higher proportion of migrants? Culiac√°n or Chihuahua?
* Lots of stereotyping, the book is in english of course, but lots of use of 'what's up ese' and 'cholo', and other informal mexican slang from the 'bad guys' in the book. But the good people just used  english and no slang. So if you ever hear a mexican using slang in america, they're probably bad! (what the author is implying)
* Author loves trying to connect the reader to mexico by highlighting its closeness with american culture. 'there is a mall with a sephora and a pizza hut' or the part where they say acapulco used to be better because american tourists used to go there.
* things that are authentically mexican are  secondary  in this book

The whole thing is just shallow and cheesy. I was hoping for a story that would give me a view into the life of someone who had a more realistic story.",books,2147
"A bit of context: I don't read books often, i find manga and anime my favourite way to enjoy storytelling, but I also can't say I don't like books just because they're books. A year ago or so I was so sucked into 1Q84 and Kafka on the shore by Murakami that I basically did only read that at every possible moment, until I finished them. I also really enjoyed some Lovecraft stories and back in the days 1984.

So if the medium is not the problem, why can't i seem to enjoy such a popular fantasy book? It can't be the genre either, most manga and anime I read/watch are just fantasy or scifi (shounen or seinen).

My problem with this book is that every time I try to read it, I just can handle a few pages, then I quit saying ""So what?"". It doesn't seem interesting in any aspect. Every time something happens, I don't find a way to care. Vin enters the band? They want to kill god? All those metal rules? Who cares. And I honestrly dont understand why it's like this for me.

I genuinely want to appreciate this book, but I can't seem to do it. Maybe is it because I'm too early into the story? I've read 200 pages up til now, which should be 1/3 of the whole thing. But it seems so slow and leading up to nothing. And most problematic, I really don't care about any character so far, so keeping reading feels like a chore.

Can enyone sell me this book, or tell me something I'm missing to appreciate it more?",books,1413
"Hi, I want to read the new song of ice and fire book when (if) it comes out.  The problem is i haven‚Äôt read any of the other books.

My question is do y‚Äôall think I‚Äôll be completely lost and uninterested if i read the new one? Any recommendations on how i can catch up quick without reading all the books? Thank you.",books,475
"Initially the book lagged a bit but once it kicked off...it kicked off big time. Thrillers haven't been satisfying me lately but this one totally re-energized me with hope for the genre. I love how Foley used the characters to weave a tapestry of secrets and hidden agendas. Those twists shook me (good thrillers should leave your mouth agape for minutes and this one totally did). Although some of the twists were predictable, the vast majority were not and i thoroughly enjoyed it. 

There were some aspects i didn't enjoy in the story like the pre-occupation with high school years that just added a layer of childlishness to the story which comprises of fully grown adults with lives  (I'm referring specifically to the ushers). I get it was to drive the story but it could've been dialled down a notch. Also, i was not a big fan of the writing personally. 

Overall I enjoyed my time with this book and gave it a four out of five stars!üåüüåüüåüüåü

"This is my first time reading Faulkner, and I can't help but see some hilarious parallels between the dysfunctional Compson family and the Bluth family from the TV show Arrested Development.    

The mother is exactly like Lucille: insanely self-absorbed, neurotic and self-pitying.  Benjy is like Buster, the idiot adult son who lives at home, who Mother is always barking at.  Quentin, the eldest son, has elements of Michael, since he sees himself as the one person who cares about upholding the family's values, given how concerned he is about Caddy's loss of innocence.  He, perhaps unnecessarily, puts all the weight of the family's sins on his own back just like Michael does.  Meanwhile, his father is pretty care-free about Caddy's choices and he's basically just a useless alcoholic, just like how George Bluth Sr. is chilling in prison and doing random shenanigans most of the time, useless to whatever problems his family is dealing with in any given episode.  Jason's chapter reminded a lot of Job, and specifically the episode where Job takes over as the executive at the company and acts like a complete dick to everyone around him (""this is a $5,000 suit, CMON!"").  Miss Quentin is kinda like Maeby - a rebellious daughter figure.  And Uncle Maury is Tobias, a clown of an uncle who's rather pathetic and made fun of by others in the family.    

The parallels aren't exactly 1-to-1 for every character , but there are so many similarities between these two comically dysfunctional families.  Maybe the way I'm thinking about the novel isn't what you're ""supposed"" to do or what Faulker intended, but it's helping me get through it because otherwise it's a very depressing story about the tragic downfall of a family.  I still have the last chapter to read, so maybe that'll wrap things up on a lighter note...    

Any other Faulkner readers/Arrested Development fans notice this connection?",books,1908
"I am currently reading the second book in the Poppy War series.

"(Sorry that this isn‚Äôt completely focussed on books, but I didn‚Äôt know where else to put this, and books are a super important aspect of it.)

The Princess Bride (1987) is probably my favourite movie and most certainly my favourite book. One of the best things about the movie in my opinion is it‚Äôs loyalty to the original text; to the point where many lines are lifted exactly from the book. I think this makes the film so much more enjoyable for fans of the book and also grounds the story in its literary roots. Another aspect that I enjoy about the film is the impeccable casting choices. Upon rereading the book, I honestly can‚Äôt imagine the characters as anyone else than their on-screen counterparts. Furthermore, the story as translated to movie loses none of its main focus or plot direction; the only major change is the cutting of the more in-depth look at the backstories of Fezzik and Inigo. If anything, I think this is a positive as it means that someone who both reads the book and watches the movie can get enjoyment out of both without it feeling like they‚Äôre too identical or too different. I think that the Princess Bride is one of the best examples of how books can successfully be translated into movies.

My question is this: what do you think about the film adaptation and how do you think this film has been successful where other book adaptations have failed?

What would you suggest as a literary canon for the English language today? I'm asking about books old and new that you think ""a reasonably educated person"" (however you take that to mean) should have read / should read?

This is a little different than the ""Literature of..."" section since the books don't have to be from a specific place or culture; they don't even need to be originally in English, as long as they've been translated, but the list would be for someone who grew up speaking English.

"Here's my review of Bill Bryson's *A Short History of Everything*. I would love to hear what other people thought of the book!

---

If everyone on Earth owned a copy of *A Short History of Nearly Everything*, and they stacked their copies one on top of the other, then that stack would touch the Moon[1].

That's the sort of thought experiment you'll find in Bill Bryson's popular science book, *A Short History of Nearly Everything*, in which Bryson (BB for short) tackles all of the Big Questions that might occur to a curious resident of our planet. Questions like ""What's the Universe?"", ""Where Did We Come From?"", and ""How Do Scientists Know That the Earth Weighs 6 Million Yottagrams?"".

There's a lot to cover in a history of the Universe. BB's story begins with the Big Bang and ends with the plight of modern humans, but along the way, he makes forays into such varied topics as quantum mechanics, cell biology and species extinction. He manages to arrange these large subject areas into a somewhat coherent narrative, never getting too bogged down by details. And, unlike a dry textbook, each victory of science is presented as a story: the dumb theories that came first, the scientists, the breakthrough, what we still don't understand, and so on.

BB cherishes any opportunity to diverge from the main thread of the story and write about scientists. While he panders a bit to the mad genius stereotype, it makes for fun reading. Isaac Newton is the prototypical eccentric scientist. His vision experiments included poking a metal needle around his eye socket and staring at the sun. By BB's account, Newton was also surprisingly coy with his research. It took an incidental encounter with Edmund Halley, one of his peers, before he launched into writing the famous *Principia Mathematica* and introduced the world to gravity and calculus.

Henry Cavendish is another curious character mentioned in the book. He was the first person to accurately measure the Earth's mass, using a contraption that looked a bit like a Rube Goldberg machine. BB writes:

&gt; [...] he was particularly devoted to the weekly scientific soir√©es of the great naturalist Sir Joseph Banks. It was always made clear to the other guests that Cavendish was on no account to be approached or even looked at. Those who sought his views were advised to wander into his vicinity as if by accident and to talk as it were into vacancy. If their remarks were scientifically worthy they might receive a mumbled reply, but more often than not they would hear a peeved squeak (his voice appears to have been high pitched) and turn to find an actual vacancy and the sight of Cavendish fleeing for a more peaceful corner.

My favourite eccentric described in the book is J.B.S. Haldane, who conducted experiments on the dangers of deep-sea exploration. His test subjects, who ranged from himself and his wife to a former prime minister of Spain, underwent rather perilous experiments in a decompression chamber that Haldane referred to as ""the pressure pot"":

&gt; Sent on a simulated descent, his wife once had a fit that lasted thirteen minutes. When at last she stopped bouncing across the floor, she was helped to her feet and sent home to cook dinner.

Oxygen poisoning, collapsed lungs and burst eardrums were among the risks undertaken by his test subjects. But, on the topic of burst eardrums, Haldane hedged that...

&gt; ...the drum generally heals up; and if a hole remains in it, although one is somewhat deaf, one can blow tobacco smoke out of the ear in question, which is a social accomplishment.

BB makes frequent use of analogy to convey scales that are outside the realm of human experience, like the volume of an atom. There are no figures like ""6 million yottagrams"" here, thank you very much. BB says that an atom lying next to a line of 1 millimeter is comparable an A4 sheet of paper lying next to the Empire State Building. This is one of at least 4 analogies based on the Empire State Building. Then, to demonstrate that an atom is mostly empty space, he asks the reader to imagine inflating its nucleus to the size of a pea; to keep the scale consistent, you'd have to inflate the atom's shell to the size of a football stadium.

Another example, which you'll recognise if you've seen Carl Sagan's *Cosmos*, is the [Cosmic Calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_Calendar). The idea is to imagine the entire history of the Universe as a 365-day calendar. On that calendar, modern humans exist for only the last 10 minutes of December 31st. Way more evocative than saying ""humans have existed for only 0.002% of the history of the Universe"".

Even science types might discover some gaps in their knowledge. As for me, I was surprised at the number of possible events that could wipe humanity from existence, including but not limited to meteor collisions, supervolcanoes and gamma rays. These catastrophic processes happen on a regular basis. The catch, however, is that they're regular on a planetary or universal timescale. BB relates a further analogy that might illustrate what I mean: lift your arms until they're horizontal to the ground and consider their span to be the entire history of the Universe. If someone now scrapes a file against one of your fingernails, it's equivalent to wiping humanity from existence. Even if civilisation-ending events happen at tiny intervals along your arm span, they're unlikely to happen during a single human lifetime. Extinction is unlikely to threaten contemporary humans, unless we manufacture it ourselves.

Science has advanced since *A Short History of Everything* was published in 2003, outdating some of its information. Pluto has been demoted to the rank of dwarf planet, the existence of the Higgs Boson particle has been confirmed experimentally, and what BB referred to as ""junk DNA"" is now believed to serve a purpose after all. The book also contains information that's just plain wrong, like the myth that church windows are thicker at the bottom due to the gradual flow of glass - they were just built like that. BB also gives credence to the popular myth that Albert Einstein was in any way an ""average"" student, when by Einstein's own account, he had mastered integral and differential calculus by the age of 14. There's obviously something seductive about the notion that there's a little Einstein buried deep inside all of us, if only we applied ourselves.

Most disgracefully, BB buys into the old sailor myth of divers literally being sucked up and squished into the helmet of their diving suits, a phenomenon known as The Squeeze. Of course, this is a ridiculous flight of fancy, probably fabricated by J.B.S. Haldane after a rough session in the pressure pot. I don't understand how BB could ever be taken in by such an obviously fake story[2].

Anyone who fixates on these minor inaccuracies is missing the Universe for the atoms, however. I happily recommend *A Short History of Everything* to anyone with even a passing interest in science. It's packed with entertaining anecdotes and eye-opening analogies.

^([1]: The Moon is 384,400,000-ish metres from Earth; a page is roughly 0.00012 metres thick; there are 544 pages in A Short History of Nearly Everything (including many pages of references); 384,400,000/(0.00012x544)=~6 billion copies would be required to touch the moon; and there are 7-8 billion people on Earth. The stack would overshoot by tens of thousands of kilometres, but that's the best Bill Bryson-esque analogy I could come up with.)

^([2]: This phenomenon was proved in an episode of Mythbusters. They created a ""meat man"" out of dead animal parts, sent him deep underwater in an old-fashioned diving suit, and cut off his air supply. The resulting pressure differential in the suit caused his entire body to be sucked up into his helmet. Yuck. (For reference, it's season 7, episode 19, ""Dumpster Diving"".

"I just finished this book and thought it was amazing! I fell in love with the setting and the characters, not to mention the really unique mystery and social undertones.

However, the first 150 pages were borderline unbearable. There is a chapter early on where we learn about what led to Blomkvist‚Äôs libel charges, and it is just pages upon pages of tedious financial talk (this financial stuff comes back later in the book but is executed so much better). I was reading it and had 0 clue what was happening. There‚Äôs also a ton of loooong details about Salander‚Äôs employer, also unnecessary imo. I think the book as a whole would‚Äôve been a lot better without wasting a hundred pages of the extremely minute details of Millenium and the libel suit and Blomkvist‚Äôs relationships. I would‚Äôve preferred one or two chapters total, and then we get immersed in the enthralling mystery and Salander‚Äôs world.

Book is still great though. I‚Äôd recommend it to anyone.",books,957

Something about these books is SO cerebrally enticing and engaging - it‚Äôs wild but so difficult to articulate by myself. 

What do people think this quality is? His stories have been made or have inspired countless sci fi classics, what is it about these stories? I keep going back. Take Three Stigmata, I‚Äôll be reading and realise I only have a grasp on the story, of which I barely understand but the consequences and stakes ring true, like  half way through.

"I grew up in Catholic schools and as an agnostic I love reading books that retell the famous stories from the bible from a different view. I read In The Shadow Of The Ark by Anne Provoost when I was a young teen. It's a retelling of the story of Noah and the Ark through an outsider's (pretty critical) view that challenges the idea of what counts as ""righteousness"" and playing God and such with a smattering of early Christian mythology. Its not the best book I've read but I find it very interesting.

Reading it now what I found the most interesting is comparing how the characters in the book reacted to the incoming devastation: once when it was a detached crazy figment of one man's imagination then as hard evidence began to show: (Spoiler? Because it's part of a well known story? Just in case) when the animals start arriving, then when the rains start (in a desert that has been long without rain), then when the rains dont stop, then when Noah and his family are seen doing final preparations in the ark, etc. If you've seen the film Noah with Russell Crow the book differs in that Noah hires people to build the ark for him instead of his family doing it all themselves, which creates a small city around the ark of people that eventually think they will ""earn"" their spot on the ark.

It made me think of the beginning of the pandemic. My country is pretty much back to (a careful) normal so I've been looking back at the initial doubt, then caution, then panic/hoarding then quiet fear when the stay home orders were issued and businesses were shut down. It was very similar to how the city of people surrounding the ark went from doubtful yet interested, then cautious (changing their behavior to earn Noah's god's favour) then panic when they realised they were not chosen for the ark, panic in building their own boats, then quiet fear when they waited for the inevitable.

I know the last part differs since the flood was an absolute that could not be avoided but still a lot.of parallels. Has anyone else read something during the pandemic that had parallels to the current situation?",books,2104

"So I was reading that front page post regarding a character page at the front of the book called a ‚Äòdramatis personae‚Äô. 

If a book had a plot twist 2/3rds of the way in that introduced a character who hasn‚Äôt been seen throughout the entire book, how would you include that character in the dramatis personae. Would you? Or would you exclude them? 

For example. Say it‚Äôs a fantasy novel and there is a character that is only spoken of in rumours, a tree spirit or a god that brings blessings on a town. If the protagonist is going to meet this character towards the end of the book would you include them in the dramatis personae with who they are?

"...and, can I just say: wow. Not in a good way.

First of all, it was a real drag to read although it was only 400 pages. I read it in Spanish, which is technically my second language, but that wasn't the main problem. The thing is, I don't understand how any reader is supposed to connect to this story. There's no soul to it, there's no emotion, the characters are all flat, etc. Not to mention the amount of incest.

In the end, I was just left thinking: ""What the hell did I just read?"" Seriously, why does this book get so much praise? Are all of Garc√≠a M√°rquez's books like this? Is this a good example of magical realism as a genre?

"Wow, Coming in from A Long Way to Small Angry Planet this is not what I was expecting(In a good way). The first book is fun, its a light read not too heavy, quirky, calming, and kind, its really was a kind book. This was not. It was dark and so uncomfortable in places that I had to put it down and walk around a little at times, and when it wasn't I was rushing to the parts that made me want to throw up again. Not that it is a disgusting book but man it does hold your emotions for hostage. Before I go into spoilers I would give my rec for this. It can be read as a standalone. It is Raw and shocking at times probably my favorite parts of it, resonating themes and imagery that will linger long after. 

SPOILERS:

The Jane narrative absolutely overshadows the Sedra narrative for me, I have seen this idea before the ship AI in a single human body was done in Ancillary Justice, but this is in no way derivative and has its own take on it, but I really couldn't care much for Sedra as much as the book tried, I do appreciate the contrasting story lines and I think that this book is so much more meaningful as it is with a double narrative that contrast of each other, the most obvious theme of humans as machines and machines as humans. But man can you blame the reader for not caring to much about Sedra when the next chapter you are reading how a little girl's whole world was being shattered and all the horrors she induced? Now this is exaggeration but just in tempo it felt so of, one chapter its high tension this girl is running for her life the next chapter someone who is getting so much help and love has her own problems then you jump back to that little girl, lost, alone afraid. The way I see it the protagonist is truly Pepper the whole way through, but the second narrative does do some beautiful contrast and it does break apart the action of the Jane narrative well.

The process of how she interpreted the sky as someone who has only ever lived in a small confined space was masterfully done. I could go on and on about all the little stuff I enjoyed but I guess I would be going on for a while longer, Im excited for what the next book holds. I need more time to process and live with the story for a bit but I have a feeling that this is going on my all time faves.",books,2292

"As a young adult books we're my escape. High school wasn't easy, and being ""different"" was stressful. Even so I could always pull through my harsh reality through books. Whenever I felt myself slipping I could also crack open the book I was reading and immerse myself into a place far from where I read.

Once I graduated I immediately found work. Wanting desperately to get myself to a place I could call home. As time and routine passed by, little by little I started to read less and less. Eventually I stopped reading all together. 

Now at 28, I feel like I've betrayed one of the most valuable habits of my development as a person. Without books I doubt I would have turned out to be the person I am today. I'm so grateful for the outlet it provided me when I needed it the most but I question myself for letting something so important in my life go.

"Make it Stick is a well-written account on the effectiveness of learning strategies. Highly recommend the book to anyone interested in teaching or learning. As is turns out research shows that some of the most common strategies such as massed practice, cramming, rereading are not very effective and encourage illusions of learning. 

Some strategies found to be effective are:

* Retrieval practice (after reading/lecture trying to recall information from it rather than referring back to text or notes because this strengthens pathways to information)
* Interleaving practice: Instead of practicing the same problem repeatedly it is better to vary practice (e.g. if learning guitar instead of practicing the same song for hour it may be more beneficial to practice one song 15 minutes then another song for 15 minutes and so on).
* Spaced practice. Giving yourself time to consolidate information between practice and learning sessions has been shown to help learners. 
* Having a Growth Mindset. Believing that you are able to improve your intelligence through study has been shown to significantly affect the achievements of students. 
* Deliberate practice. This is the type of practice experts do. It is effortful and challenging. Instead of being inside their comfort zone they are expanding their boundaries by exposing themselves to new challenges which the brain can turn into familiar territory after the effort. 

This is a brief overview of some core ideas. It is well-researched with studies backing up the claims. Unfortunately, making me feel like I've wasted a lot of time, particularly when I was an undergrad, with ineffective strategies. At least it's good to know now when I want to learn something new the best way to go about it.",books,1752

I asked, ""What do you mean by distracted? Let's define that first."" 

He said, ""I will be reading something, and it's actually interesting, but then I start thinking about something and it seems so unrelated."" 

My answer was, ""You should really write down what you are thinking, even if you think it's unrelated. The mind has a way of exploring a lot of hidden areas and dark places, or bringing up old thoughts and memories, because in some way, your subconscious -- which is really powerful -- finds connections in even the most random things. When you write them down, you may find later that an answer develops that explains why you were thinking it."" 

I added, ""You know, just because you ar reading something right now does not mean that the answer happens right now. Books are kind of like slow-fuse bombs. They do their work over a very long period of time and something good can explode in our minds from them long after we have put down the text.""

"Zero Zero Zero by Roberto Saviano.  Holy son of a cocaine drug lord, what a book.  What a high.  I just finished reading it, and am still awestruck at the story my brain consumed.  Undeniably artful, with exemplary prose and evocative descriptions, yet also gruesome in its factual accounts of all the pain and suffering that the drug trade has caused.  I haven't read anything quite like it.    


Saviano describes his book as a ""nonfiction novel.""  As he writes in the opening pages of the preface, ""The nonfiction novel is not only or simply a literary genre.  It is a vision of the world, an account of reality that seemingly escapes all categorization.""  It blends creative writing (including one mini chapter written entirely as a poem, listing all the nicknames for cocaine) with hard journalistic fact and years of research.  It gives the best of both worlds, imo, and made for a unique reading experience.    


Some of the unorthodox style may be because the book was translated from Italian, but that doesn't account for the very deliberate structure of the book.  It also makes no apologies for breaking a couple of conventions in its prose (eg: second person pronoun invocation &amp; tense switching), and maybe that adds to the art?  Either way, a stirring read.  Some characters are more vivid than others, and they rarely connect in an overarching plot, but I suppose one could argue that's kind of the point: cocaine is the game, and the 'kingpins' are really just pawns.    


The other unique thing about Zero Zero Zero was that it was adopted into a limited TV Series on Amazon Prime (best drug show since The Wire, imo), yet the book doesn't spoil anything for the tv series, and vice versa.  They both serve to complement each other (as the tv series is decidedly more fictional than the book).  Rare to see that in adaptations.    


Anyway, Zero Zero Zero: a strong recommend.  Any other books written in this style?  Or other thoughts on the ""nonfiction novel"" as a genre?",books,1998
"I've read part of the book and I've just watched the 2014. It's disturbing and really deserves the ""gothic"" genre. One of the most disturbing parts is how Corrine's maternal love fades in favor of greed.

But... Now I'm googling about it and the storyline seems a bit confusing.

Corrine's own descripting makes it sounds like her husband was her half-uncle and not blood related to her, and her parents were just religious fanatics.

Still, there's a book prequel that, with a rather confusing family tree, says that Corrine and Christopher Sr. are actually half-siblings as well, and blood related. 

Could anyone just solve this for me?

In addition, do you guys think Corrine was disturbed from the start and it only got worse? She came from a crazy family, after all, and was the product of rape. That could affect somebody's mind.

Something in one of the 2014's movies first scenes gives me a weird feeling, how she showers her husband with hungry kisses in front of the kids. Maybe just a passionate wife.",books,1013

It seemed like once he was told free will doesn‚Äôt exist he had lost his free will. 

This reminded of an argument from another book whose title is ‚ÄúThe Science of Good and Evil‚Äù. In it the author argues that if god exists and is all knowing then we have no free will because god already knows what decisions we are going to make. This has stuck with me because I do believe in god, but I also want to believe that we have free will. 

I thought Vonnegut did a really good job in actually showing the horrors of war. The nonchalant mention of candles from the fat of killed Jews. When billy cried after seeing the condition of the horses after they took them to Dresden. The conditions in the train to the first pow camp. 

Overall I really liked the book, and I‚Äôll probably read it again in a few years to see how my view on it changes. I loved how it made me think, and I would definitely recommend it. Plus it‚Äôs a pretty quick read.",books,1908
Does any one know of the value of this book? I‚Äôve read it and I want to see if I want to keep it or sell it. It is The Mother‚Äôs by Vardis Fisher. I cannot find anything with the same look. It was produced in 1943 and I believe it is first issue. But I can‚Äôt find anything on it. Any help would be appreciated!! [the pictures](https://imgur.com/gallery/0lZciu9),books,360
"I would really like to read Les Miserables, and I've had a copy for years now. The only problem is that I've never read any french authors, let alone Victor Hugo, and the sheer density of Les Mis is daunting. It is a difficult text? should I start with something like the Hunchback of Notre Dame before I move on to Les Mis? I'd love to hear your experiences with it",books,366

"Hi everyone,

I'm looking to buy my first ebook reader and I'd love to hear your advice as I'm a little bit confused by the options I've found. I hope this is OK to post here, I haven't found a general reader subreddit with a meaningful number of members and most general threads on this topic I've seen were in [r/books](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/).

I had been set on a Kindle initially. Since then I've done some research and now I know of several alternatives but have trouble deciding. 

Now here are my concerns. I would have gone for the Kindle, were it not for the absence of color temperature adjustments (which basically everyone else seems to have). Reading in the dark/in bed when the rest of my family is asleep is important to me.

Everyone seems to be comparing the Kobo to the Kindle. Since I've never had an ebook reader I don't know how important the software is.  I have to admit, some of the dictionary/translation options on the Kindle do look quite useful. Any other advice for the software? Anything you consider dealbreakers?

Last thing: I think I'd need audiobooks too that I can listen to along with while reading. And I anticipate I'd read a lot of sideloaded/converted epubs but as far as I have seen that seems to work with all of them equally well, right?

My budget is not that great so I would appreciate a small price for a reader that I can use to read books with. Any suggestions? I usually download my books on pdfs, epubs, and stuff, then read them.

Thanks for reading, I appreciate any advice.",books,1538
"(*Note: I am linking my own video breaking down this book at the end of this post).*

I recently read Outliers, by Malcom Gladwell. As someone who is trying to get more into reading, I figured this is a great classic to get started with. I am a young, recent college-grad and recently quit my job to pursue my dreams of entrepreneurship, so I found a lot of the stories in this book to resonate with my own journey.

**Since this book** ***is*** **a classic, I was wondering -- what were your biggest takeaways from the book? How did this shape your perspective on success?** Here are my three favorite quotes: 

**1. 'Practice isn't the thing you do once you're good. It's the thing you do that makes you good.' (42)**

Even before picking up this book, I had heard of the 10,000 hour rule. Even though the rest of the book is about how factors beside hard work and intelligence shape success, this is a reminder that they are still (in my opinion) the fundamental qualities one needs to get close to success.

**2. 'Those three things ‚Äî autonomy, complexity and a connection between effort and reward ‚Äî are, most people agree, the three qualities that work has to have if is to be satisfying.' (149)**

A lot of the decisions I made recently were in an effort to find work that I find fulfilling myself, that I can see myself doing for the next 40 years. So, this was a great reminder of what I should strive towards myself.

**3. 'Outliers are those who have been given opportunities ‚Äî and who have had the strength and presence of mind to seize them.' (267)**

A lot of this book makes it seem like you need ample opportunity to succeed -- i.e. privilege. However, the true purpose of this book is to highlight the fact that you need to have a certain mindset and level of motivation/drive to take advantage of the opportunities you are handed, however small or big. And, that those who are in those positions of power or influence should lift others up and provide them with similar opportunities to provide equal opportunity for all. 

One of the things I've been doing on my own journey towards fulfillment has been making a YouTube channel where I share self-improvement and productivity tips/thoughts. So, [here is a video](https://youtu.be/A3QoW-wywvU) where I explore these three ideas in more depth. Take a look if you'd like!

I absolutely adored this book as a child. The illustrations were so vivid and I can‚Äôt help but think it helped shaped my appreciation for illustration and animation in general.

"I'm almost done reading the first volume, The Solitudes, and it's really amazing. On a basic plot level, the story doesn't sound too exciting. A historian starts to learn about magic and astrology and Hermeticism and stuff, and plans to write an ""alternate"" history of the world (the story of not Egypt but √Ügypt). But the range of ideas, the characters, and the inventive digressions, is really making it one of the most intriguing reading experiences I've had in a while. John Crowley's other acclaimed work, Little, Big, was a straight up whimsical fantasy, but this one has the fantastic elements in the background. I guess magical realism is an appropriate label but I don't know. I'm only one volume into a series of four volumes and am excited to read the rest. So far it's quite a shapeless novel, but there are some metatextual hints of an overall structure, as well as some strange details or quirks that may or may not be more significant later on. Anyway I fully recommend this book to anyone who would like to read something unique and is a fan of gorgeous and dreamy prose.",books,1087
"After years upon years of being harassed by rapists, pedophiles, and murders.  These police officers and their family members, stalked me to Lethbridge, Alberta.  A bowl full of uniformed and plain clothes turd members of law enforcement showed up to my work one day.  They told me they will stop pursuing me with all of the lies they accuse me of, if I take the job of kitchen manager at Lethbridge Correctional Centre.  I told them to take their evidence and press charges, or get the fuck out of my face.  As they left I made toilet bowl flushing noises.  After about three to six months the turds returned, repeated their offer of allegedly not going to spread evidenceless lies about me.  I then repeated my response, press charges or go fuck your self.

After about a year or so, I found myself in need of a job.  So I searched Indeed and found a job posting for kitchen cook at Lethbridge Correctional Centre.  I was interviewed by the current kitchen manager, who hired me later that day.  I began working for Compass the next day at Lethbridge Correctional Centre.  Law enforcement had nothing to do with my hire and did not know I had taken the job till I was already working there.   

Once on the job, the RCMP, prison management, and prison guards began the harassment.  Accusing me of crimes including but not limited to, rapes, murders, viewing child porn, and some of my personal favourites, stealing bottles and diesel.  I would defend my self verbally against groups of four to over ten at a time.  I would refuse to do any spying or anything that would jeopardize my safety.  I was paid to cook and supervise the inmates not to deal out punishment, and that is all I would do.  There were eleven inmates at a time and just two kitchen staff.  No guard presence in the kitchen unless something happened and the were called or doing their counts.  

On two separate occasions an RCMP officer admitted to making 8 attempts to murder me. Including breaking into my home and planting pills inside my glucosamine chondroitin in and attempt to murder me.  This was done in front of a group of law enforcement who refused to press charges. So I placed him under a citizens arrest myself.  Telling the officer ‚Äúyou are under a citizens arrest for attempted murder, you have the right to remain silent, you have the right to an attorney, anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law‚Äù.  Both times the group then walked away like nothing had transpired.  

On two more occasions, two police bothers confessed to the rape and murder of nurse Sonia Varaschin.  I requested charges being pressed against them, but was denied by the group of RCMP and prison guards.  So I place them both under a citizens arrest, telling them ‚Äúyou are under a citizens arrest for the rape and murder of nurse Sonia Varaschin, you have the right to remain silent, you have the right to an attorney, anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law‚Äú.  Again, every single turd member of the law enforcement walked away, including the rapist murders.  

	
On another occasion one of the D.D.O.‚Äôs of Lethbridge Correctional Centre defamed my character, accusing me of being a pedophile, threatened to have me chemically castrated, then gave the inmates my full name and home address. This was done while we were lined up about to plate lunch in full view of several cameras.  I request charges but like before police do not police, police.
	
The management of the prison was committing fraud by using non minimum security offenders in the kitchen.  We were told upon hire that it would only be minimum offenders, but the kitchen crews were filled with gang members, murders, and sex offenders.   

After about several months the powers that be decided they no longer wanted me at the prison, so they decided to bring in an incredibly dangerous human being to deal with me.  The guy the were bringing had spent a huge portion of his life behind bars as a maximum security offender.  Now this guy had made the news recently at that time.  While locked up on remand one night, he cling filmed another inmate to a toilet, cut off his ear, then sucked his dick for hours, until the guards showed up in the mourning.  Before his arrival, other inmates were warning me that he is coming for me.  

Now my schedule was three days on three days off.  Me and my cook assistant would do our three days, then we would switch out with the other cook and cook assistant.  The cooks would be given two units to choose eleven inmates from each.  One unit you would get for breakfast and lunch and the other you would get for dinner.  As the paid staff would switch every three days, so would the inmates from breakfast lunch to dinner and vice versa.  You would write you inmate list for the next day, so my day one would be written by the other cooks day three.  My day one I would write my day two, my day two I would write my day three.  And if the other cook fucked me with a shitty kitchen crew, on my day three I could get my revenge for his day one. 

 I‚Äôm not sure who brought this guy down originally, but he worked good. He knew how to make trays, pour juice, make bricks, wash dishes.  It was clear this wasn‚Äôt his first kitchen crew. With his presence the other inmates had something to worry about instead of being fixed on fucking with me.  

Now from what I heard, he was given a time limit to get ride of me.  If he is successful, he gets to stay at the all inclusive resort of LCC, if not he goes back to federal prison where he is locked up twenty three hours a day.  Now I am not someone who is going to be run off anything I want.  This job pays garbage, but it is a nice three on three off.  After resisting weeks of pressure this guy is applying, his time is getting close to up.  

Now I will describe a bit the actual play by play of how a prison kitchen works.  We would make three meals per day, weekdays, two on weekends.  Now these meals are not hungry man meals thrown in a microwave.  They involve prep work, and that work involves knives.  The knives would be kept secure in the office.  They would have a hole drilled through them with a steel loop. There were kitchen tables that would have a string of steel with loop on it.  You connect the loops and put a lock on it, now that knife would be secure to the table.  I would still have to get the knives from the office to the table.  Now when doing this I would like to walk around first, and see what everyone is doing.  

I come out of the office one day to do a walk around before I bring the knife out.  I look right, and the inmates are making trays.  I walk straight ahead and to my left the inmates are making bricks.  I keep walking forward and to my right some are in the dish pit washing dishes.  Continuing on to my left some of them are making juice, and now I arrive at the table.  Now it is a clean shinny stainless steel table with one classic plastic knife out of place.  It is the knife the inmates get on every tray. The kind you would find in any cafeteria to spread margarine or peanut butter.  Now sometimes I will have people tossing flags at this knife thinking it is nothing to be worried about.  You put that knife through someone‚Äôs eye, and they are fucking done.  

I look to the right and hiding behind this post is Williams.  I‚Äôm not sure how many fights you have been in, in your life, if any.  But there is a tension in the air that you can feel, and I felt it.  Now to see where this guys heads at I engaged him in conversation.  I said something like, ‚Äúhey‚Äù, he replied something in a voice you could hear was filled with tension, coming from a mind that was clearly thinking about what was coming next, as he slowly crept toward the knife.

Now a little background about me, I played high school basketball and I was good.  Now a major component of basketball is judging distance, you need to know what people are capable of to decided where you are going to be.  So as he is creeping toward the knife, so am I.  We are just making small chat, as we both inch closer and closer.  We both pause, pretty much toe to toe.  Now I‚Äôm one hundred percent convinced there is going to be a stabbing.  Like I said I played high school basketball, I‚Äôm competitive.  If there is going to be a stabbing, I‚Äôm going to want to win that stabbing.  We both look at each other, look at the knife, look back at each other, and its like this Hollywood scene where we both just dive for the knife at the same time.  I have the longer arms and judged the distance correctly, I came up with the knife.  

I grab the knife with my right hand and pull it across my body.  He is desperately trying to get the knife with both hands.  As I get the knife to my right side, I scoop under and raise his arms with my left arm.  Now his entire rib cage is exposed.  I waste no time at all, and immediately start warming up his ribs.  He has on the inmate coveralls designed to take hits from a plastic knife.  So no bloody damage is done.  I put what I felt was about eight to twelve strikes of justice into his ribs. R.C.M.P. Would later go on to tell me it was actually 17.  He broke off and walks away all pissed off.  

Now he is heading away from me along the length of the table towards the freezer wall.  Made a left and headed towards and past fridge two.  He kept walking with his head down until he got to fridge one, where he paused.  He raised his head  almost like he got that little cartoon thought bubble that said ‚Äúfuck this guy‚Äù.  He turns around and start coming back. 

Now the first round of stabbing was just raw animal instinct like a lion taking down a gazelle.  But I had a few moments to think this time around.  I remember this one Brock Lesnar fight where instead of two guys just sizing each other up in the middle of the ring, he just ran the guy over.  So I decide that is going be my move.  I picked a spot on the floor, when he gets to it I will strike.  I‚Äôm going to push him upwards and back to get his weight off his feet.  Hopefully he will go flying back into the freezer wall.  Before he has his weight back over his feet and his bearings, I will be back in his ribs.  

He is at fridge two, at the freezer, then makes the right.  He is eyeballing the knife on his approach.  Right when he is on my spot, with the reflexes of a cat and the speed of a mongoose, I pounce.  Everything goes flawless, he flies back and I am like a fat kid on round two at a Chinese buffet.  I put what I felt was another  four to eight strokes of justice into his ribs.  Again R.C.M.P. would later get the actual count of 12.  You always here in the news, he was crazy, he stabbed the person an insane amount of times. I'm telling you from first hand experience, once you got momentum and the autopilot kicks in, it's hard to stop. He breaks off shouting ‚ÄúI‚Äôm done, I'm done‚Äù. 


As the event begins to cure in my mind.  I am just standing there holding this plastic knife like a champion, listening to one of the black inmates chirping him, ‚Äúya done, ya done‚Äù",books,11072
"Rereading Dorian Gray more than a decade after I first read it in high school... I really didn‚Äôt remember half of this book, and it‚Äôs wonderful. Chapter 11 is soooooo dense. What an interesting way to show passage of time: having Dorian Gray speak on every last piece of art he has appreciated and collected. Really shows how he is captive to his new ‚Äúspirituality of the senses.‚Äù So dense I kept finding myself googling certain things. Took me about an hour to read one chapter. And at the end of it he‚Äôs lived such a full life but to him and to the readers, not much time actually seemed to have passed. Very complex book and character; in Chapter 11 very little happens, but, in my opinion, it‚Äôs the heart of the character. I love that Wilde has created a book within the book(Henry‚Äôs gift), trapping Dorian‚Äôs mind with a book while his body is trapped in a painting. 
     
     
I don‚Äôt know if this book worships an appreciation of art or demonizes it. I suppose it lends itself to the saying ‚Äúall good things in moderation‚Äù but I (much like Lord Henry) like to tack on ‚Äúincluding moderation‚Äù to the saying. 
     
     
I love how he has such an appreciation for religion and for tradition but at the same time talks about getting back to being animalistic and finding joy in sensation where religion would want you to dull your senses.
     
     

Didn‚Äôt realize a carbuncle had its origins as a medieval gemstone, but it‚Äôs funny knowing where Dorian is headed that he would find them fascinating while his portrait is covered in the gross boil type of carbuncles.
     
      

The way Sybil is cast aside when she doesn‚Äôt play the part he has cast for her in his mind is so horrific. Very much shows the idea of him being more in love with art and sensation than reality. Dude is straight up delusional but fascinating. He‚Äôs so learned, and experienced in some regards, but will always be some stunted child both physically and mentally. 
     
     

The poetic descriptions Wilde puts in really make this book come to life, just as Dorian sees the book he obsessed over come to life. Also the Fleur de Lys he mentions so often adorn his collection is ironic as it‚Äôs the symbol of France and he loves that book about a Parisian. He doesn‚Äôt want to be who he is, and wants to explore the world and sensations, but then he stops leaving England before his 25th birthday. Rather he‚Äôd just collect art and live vicariously. Strange metaphor for his true self literally being trapped within a literal work of art. 
     
     

Been wrestling with the last lines of Ch11 also: ‚ÄúDorian Gray has been poisoned by a book. There were moments when he looked on evil simply as a mode through which he could realize his conception of the beautiful.‚Äù 
     
Does the book mean the more obvious one which Henry gave him, or perhaps the Bible? For what is ‚Äúevil‚Äù if you don‚Äôt have any concept of it? Without knowing good vs evil, Dorian might spend his whole life in pursuit of beauty without a single regret. After all, regret is what started to mar his portrait in the start. (Or at least that‚Äôs what he comes up with for what spurred the initial disfigurement of the painting)
     
     
This chapter seems so superfluous, but it gets right to the soul of the main character, much like his interests may seem superfluous. 
     
     
Anyone have anything to add? Also, the Art Institute of Chicago reopens on July 30, and Ivan Albright‚Äôs Painting of Dorian Gray is in their permanent collection. Definitely go see it when you feel it is safe to do so.",books,3553
"Wild Bill Hickok is a name most people have probably heard but know little about. During his lifetime, he became an internationally recognized celebrity on par with today's biggest Hollywood stars. Because of his reputation, he quickly became mythologized and ""tall tales"" began to spread about him through dime novels and the hyperbolic (and often flat out fictionalized) accounts people shared of their encounters with the notorious gunslinger. Clavin does not really immerse you in the exploits of Wild Bill, but rather chronicles his life while separating fact and fiction; the truth is as fascinating as the myth. Clavin also does a solid job in describing the real American West during the post-civil war era of expansion and how celebrity existed at the time. I recommend this book to anyone interested in Wild Bill or learning more about America in the 2nd half of the 19th century.",books,890

"Questionning masculinity has been the trend for the last few decades. Toxic masculinity is the buzzword of the last few years and with valid reasons.

What happened to positive masculinity, what does that even mean? What if true, fully realized masculinity has never been a thing in the entirety of
human's history? 

According to Robert Moore and Douglas Gillette, the male psyche can be divided into four archetypes of masculinity that represent our different drives.
The King, the Warrior, the Magician and the Lover. 

The King embodies the greatest aspect of masculinity, his wish for himself and his people to prosper. He influences himself and others to achieve
things they never thought would be possible. The shadow aspect of this is the tyrant who uses his power to opress others(and ultimately himself)
and protect his position.

The Warrior is probably the most infamous of the archetypes as it has been manifested in it's negative form for thousands of years. Men have
this drive to conquer and achieve, this is where our ambition and agression stems from. It can be used in combination with the King energy to 
drive humanity forward and fight battles for the good of all or to opress, dominate and subjugate others.

The Magician is where our love for intellectual pursuits, knowledge and understanding comes from. It fuels our drive to invent and conquer technology
to improve all of our lives. It can also turn into ego and hiding knowledge and technology to enrich ourselves and take from those who don't have access
to said knowledge.

The Lover is the most hidden archetype that's starting to surface more and more as we become a more integrated society. It connects us to our emotions
and the sensual side of life. Most men repress their feelings and force themselves to act stoic in all situations and mostly express their negative emotions
in the form of anger. Women are a lot better than us at expressing their full panel of emotions.

Men have an incredibly diverse psyche with a lot of hidden sides that can be repressed and turn into negative masculine expression which gives us
the toxic masculinity that is being called out these days. Robert Moore and Douglas Gillette's book King Warrior Magician Lover breaks this down in both
a spiritual but modern context giving us examples of lawyers, doctors and accountants repressing their emotions and using their knowledge from a selfish insecurity
and gives us inspiration for a new wave of integrated men. 

I'm curious if anyone here has read this or heard about it? I've not seen it mentioned anywhere but I'd definitely recommend every men out there and the women that love them give it a read. I'd love to hear thoughts on it.",books,2707
"A few years ago my friends bought me a gift. 
This gift was Liber Novus, The Red Book by Jung.

I hold this gift in great regard, so much so that I barely open it. Every time I do, I'm met with a great bounty of knowledge, I close the book and wait till it's time to crack it open again.

I felt this book was special, and I'm got rid of a bunch of books that I don't feel like are mine anymore - and I don't want to carry those around. I took it to a local book seller.

Made a few jokes, had a few laughs about general stuff and Terry Pratchett (Should have brought my wife) and I brought in Liber Novus for him to look at and tell me if there was truly anything special about it.

He cleaned it off. More chatting. He has a treasure trove of all sorts of material I'm going back for. 

He then proceeds to take his archival paper, wraps the dust cover and gives it back to me, explaining how to care for it, and how sure he was that I'd be back to sell it to him. It looks so amazing now, it feels protected and I'm going to have a clamshell built for it.

"I used to use Wattpad regularly to read people‚Äôs short stories and stuff like that. It was a great way to open my mind for new books and genres and I loved it. I even considered writing myself but decided against it. 

I came across After by Anna Todd and tried to read it. It was full of errors and was originally a fan fiction written about Harry Styles. I tried so hard to give it a chance. I even tried to give the edited version that‚Äôs sold in stores a chance. I just cannot stand the book. People recommend it to me all the time as a good teen novel, but for some reason knowing that it was originally meant as a fan fiction just makes me angry. 

I love that people write fan fiction, and I‚Äôm so glad that some people are found on Wattpad and published, but there‚Äôs just something about After that makes me irrational. I know writers out there who spend years writing a novel, perfecting it, doing everything they can, and still get rejected by publishers. For some reason, knowing that someone could publish something online completely full of errors and still get a book deal and a movie deal makes me angry. 

I don‚Äôt know if this is a shared opinion, but my husband doesn‚Äôt care about my rant about the book and I wanted to try to find someone who related to this feeling.",books,1283
" This weekend, I started reading A Woman Is No Man by Etaf Rum. It tells a story of how different generations approach love and marriage in the Palestinian culture. It‚Äôs a great book and I‚Äôm only 20% through. 

I like hearing these kind of stories through the voices of Arabs as opposed to non Arabs that think they understand. I don‚Äôt like to read about any minority that wasn‚Äôt written by that minority. The assumption of how a culture works is almost always over exaggerated and incorrect. 

I can‚Äôt wait to provide more insight of this book. It‚Äôs hard to put down.",books,568

"For me, I like to jump right into the next, usually beginning the next day. Unless I have a literal book hangover which has happened a handful of times. I get so emotionally wound up in certain stories that sometimes it takes a few WEEKS to move onto something else. 

Normal People by Sally Rooney did that to me, I was bothered by the ending for at least 3 weeks and I couldn't even think of letting another book do that to me again so soon. I even had a copy of Conversations with Friends to read but was scared that it would affect me the same way so I made myself read something light between those. 

Curious how long other people wait in between books and why, and also whether they use that time to ""digest"" the book they just read or just mentally move on completely from it?",books,784

"I recently ordered a box set of the Raven Cycle as a present for a friend through a local bookshop, since I couldn't find it online. My initial googling had revealed that Maggie Stiefvater is American, so I noted that I specifically was looking for the US edition hoping to avoid any weird localization issues √† la Harry Potter since they're from the same publisher. Now that the box set has arrived I sadly noticed that it was indeed the dreaded UK edition, despite assurances of the shop owner to have found the US version. Currently I'm wondering if I need to return the books and hope to find a US edition or if the changes are negligible enough not to matter. Sadly I can't exactly open the packaging to read the books for myself, so I'm asking here because Google keeps trying to teach me about the differences between ravens and crows instead of actually helping.

Does anyone know the extent of the differences between the US and UK editions of the Raven Cycle? Spelling colour instead of color is negligible for example but if a book set in America starts talking about bins and jumpers and lorries left and right I imagine that would break the immersion a lot more. Or is there possibly a website that gathers information about such differences between book editions?",books,1277
"As someone who has spent most of their life fretting about death and my maybe not so distance demise, this book hit me like a double trailer transfer truck filled with boulders. 

why have i only heard of this book now? 

the denial of death is becker's brilliant and impassioned answer to the why of human existance. becker tackles the problem of the vital lie - man's refusal to acknowledge his own mortality. in doing so, he sheds new light on the nature of humanity and issues a call to life and its living that still resonates.

this might be one of the most important books ever written. it has life changing magical powers. if everyone on earth read and understood the deeper meaning of this book the world would be an immeasurable amount better. i don't even know what it would look like. 

it wasn't the easiest read, it was dense in parts, so I just picked away at it over a month. a chapter every other night, sometimes just a page or two, until i got closer to the end and read three chapters in a row to finish. i didn't think anything of the book afterwards - i was happy to be done and to move onto something else a little more uplifting, less dense, more summery. and then a week later i was standing looking out over a river and like a puzzle the deeper meaning of the book came together, and i really haven't been the same since, which is an, admittedly, dramatic thing to say, but it is the truth. i really never completely understood what it means to be a human being until finishing this. it has humbled me to my core.

has anyone else read this and maybe had a similar, life shattering, reaction to it? would love to hear some thoughts on it.

if you are looking for answers to depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues you will find the book to be extremely helpful. i have suffered with some sort of anxiety, low hanging cloud of depression for as long as i can remember, and maybe it's just some short term high, but i have not experienced anything of the sort since understanding the message of this book, and instead have found some long yearned for, and much needed, inner peace.",books,2117
"Back in high school, I was a book fiend. I read all of Harry Potter. I read the Belgariad, the Mallorean, Belgarath the Sorcerer and Polgara the Sorceress. *And* the Redemption of Althalus.

"I was staggered when I found out today about the literacy rates in Europe:

Approximately 55 million adults in Europe (ages 16-65) have extremely poor literacy. 55 million with an additional 13 million 15 year olds who also have extremely poor literacy (totaling 68 million people for Europe). The *Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies* and the *Programme for International Student Assessment* found that on average, 1 in 5 adults in Europe have tremendous literacy difficulties (pretty much illiterate). European adults of 66 years of age and older are not included in the PIAAC study, but can be expected to have *higher chance* of literacy difficulties.

"I don‚Äôt know if this is okay to post on this sub, but I wanted to discuss it with other people and get their opinions on this matter. 

I‚Äôm currently trying to read 1 book a week. So far I haven‚Äôt broken my rule, and I‚Äôve probably read around 4 or 5 books this way, one time I read two in one week (but it was a short 80 paged book and a 150 paged book). You could say I‚Äôm an avid reader. 

Before this book a week rule, I used to read a book without a deadline and usually started another book two or three days after finishing another ones. Usually I‚Äôd only spend a little over a week to read a book, so it‚Äôs not that big of a difference. In total, I‚Äôve read about 10-12 books these past 3 or 4 months. 

I only say this to emphasize that I do read a lot. This being said, my words per minute have not improved AT ALL. I‚Äôm already a little bit of a fast reader, around 370 or 400 wpm on a good day. But it‚Äôs remained constant for months, even with my improved reading times, I have made no progress. 

I‚Äôve heard that the best way to learn how to speed read is just reading a lot (along with a few other techniques). I already do read a whole lot, either non fiction or fictions and there‚Äôs no progress. 

With this being said, maybe I‚Äôm just missing more reading experience, I‚Äôm still under 20. Or I‚Äôm just a slow reader, regardless I still enjoy reading a lot and will continue to try and improve.

I‚Äôd like to know what do you guys think on this manner? Does reading a lot help you improve pace? Does speed reading even matter? Does it affect comprehension? What are your experiences with this type of stuff?",books,1613
"What do you guys do with your dust jackets? Personally, I‚Äôm conflicted. I end up keeping pretty much all of them because discarding any part of a book feels sacrilegious. But whenever I take one off during use, it looks so much cleaner and classier- even pulp like Thomas Harris‚Äô ‚ÄúHannibal‚Äù, which inspired this post! There are some exceptions, of course- the jackets are a vital part of my Harry Potter and Malcolm Gladwell books- but with the rest, I don‚Äôt know whether to go for the minimalist look, or keep the book intact!",books,527
"I‚Äôm an 18 year old male and just finished reading Fahrenheit 451 for the second time, and both times I‚Äôve really just not been impressed at all, in fact strongly disliked the book. The first time I read it I was 13 or 14 and read it for school, and quite frankly didn‚Äôt understand much of it, so I‚Äôve always wanted to reread it because I figured I was too young when I originally read it to ‚Äúget it.‚Äù

However, I just reread the book and I have to say, I can‚Äôt see why the book is considered such a classic. The plot is extremely rushed, the character development is almost non existent, so many elements of the plot just seem so convenient (like how the city which the book takes place has absolutely nothing surrounding it but bands of old professors or how an entire governing body with fleets of helicopters and nothing better to do someone can‚Äôt locate a person running through the city). To me the book feels like a good short story‚ÄîI am aware it was one before being turned into a book‚Äîthat was just never meant to be a book. It‚Äôs a weird length. It needs to be longer to develop the characters and context surrounding the society in which the book takes place, or shorter so the reader doesn‚Äôt feel like those things are left out. Brave New World and 1984 both were much better, more original books than Fahrenheit, and I genuinely have no idea how someone could consider Fahrenheit a masterpiece.

"Note: Contains Spoilers

Maybe the title is misleading, I didnt *just* finish We Need New Names, I finished it a few days ago. But I needed time to think about it and let it sink in. I started it as a 'filler' book, a short and sweet read between two mega classics Crime and Punishment and Dr Zhivago. But it was so powerful, I still haven't let it go enough to start Dr Zhivago. Which is why I felt I had to write this post. 

At the surface the story is about a Zimbabwean girl who moves to the US. It is written from a child's viewpoint and is split about half way between the two places. For me it was one of the truest to a child's narrative I've read, comparable To Kill a Mockingbird, I also think the author does an amazing job at conveying how the girl actually grows up in the novel. Her narrative matures as the novel progresses very realisticly.

But the impact and beauty of this novel goes much deeper than the surface. The authors metaphors of which there many are powerful. The one that particularly stands out for me is when she compares the bending of the Zimbabwean people to that of the bending guava tree (a recurring symbol in the novel) under the weight of rotting guavas (which is a metaphor for the corrupt government). I also loved her 'essay' chapters where she steps back and writes about issues, this reminded me alot of The Grapes of Wrath. She also captures the struggle of the people and there interactions with wealth (in Budapest) and charity and desperation, but also the sense of community.

Finally, I think the reason this novel resonated with me so powerfully was because she captured a very real reality for me. I'm currently living in South Africa, never sure if I need to leave. Never sure what the right choice is. Home will always be home. This book showed me what I already knew but said it so much more eloquently than I could ever have. That there is no easy or right choice when it comes to emmigration you will always lose something because the country you were born in will always be a part of you, calling you home. As the book says you will always be sitting on one buttcheek. The book was phenomenal and want to hug NoViolet Bulawayo for writing something that made me feel so many things and that moved me the way few other books have. I am eagerly awaiting for another book from her.",books,2338

That they find a hidden cave, that she climbs over the wall and that they see something shiny inbetween the trees. Thats exactly what happened the next but I have no memory from the other things that happened and not what is going to happen. I just thought its kind of weird that out of sudden those few memories are back but I don¬¥t remember the rest. Spend so much time with reading but I normally remember what books I already read.

"Firstly, I'd like to offer some background. I am not a habitual book reader by any means. In fact, a year before today, I hadn't read a single novel to completion.  But I had several of my friends who were avid readers and claimed that reading books offered its own distinct joys, something that I've always wanted to experience. So then, a year ago, I decided to, almost on a whim, read The Handmaid's tale as my first novel. Since then I've read almost half a dozen novels. Just a few moments ago, I finally finished reading 'To the Lighthouse' and I would like to share my own thoughts that have crystallized after reading it to completion. 

I was reading through other people's post about the book, and I agree with some and disagree with a few others.

Initially, I found it rather difficult to read, with the perspectives and point of view changing rather abrubtly and often interspersed with descriptions of their surroundings. I admit though, that it could also be because of my prior inexperience in reading novels. It was as if the boundary between the internal and the external had collapsed completely. I found myself spending a long time stuck on a single paragraph, desperately trying to decipher the solution to the puzzle that woolf has left us behind.  

However, after a rather rough start, I found myself enjoying the latter half of the first part. I could relate to the characters' insecurities, where they often consider themselves to be inadequate, and are constantly engulfed in self-doubt. There is also this dissatisfaction because of being unable to understand what someone else really means that is conveyed immaculately. At this point I'm convinced that woolf is a genius at capturing the human train of thought. 

&gt;How then did it work out, all this? How did one judge people, think of them? How did one add up this and that and conclude that it was liking one felt or disliking? And to those words, what meaning attached, after all?

This is one of my favorite quotes from the novel relating to Lily's frustrations with her inability to discern her impression of Mr. Ramsay. The dinner party for me, is the high point of the novel.

The second part fell upon me like a great bolt of lightning. There's a marked departure in her writing style where she glosses over several important incidents of great tragedy in the Ramsay family. I was so shook by Mrs. Ramsay's death that I spent a great deal of time trying to prize out an alternative meaning from the  straightforward passage. 

The third part however is what left me the most disappointed originally. It felt out of place with the other two parts and I felt robbed of some sort of catharsis or closure when the book ends rather abruptly with Lillie finishing the final stroke of her painting and the Ramsays' reaching the lighthouse. 

After finishing the novel, I finally decided to read the summary and analysis offered by cliffnotes , which did offer some clarity regarding the third part of the novel, but I still feel a little disappointed. 

My final impressions of the book are strangely, mixed. I loved Woolf's ability to describe consciousness and interpersonal relationships, but I'm unable to understand the significance and symbolism behind the novel's third part and eventual ending. I also feel that the Mrs. Ramsay's children could have received greator attention in the story.

I'd love to have a discussion about this , and eventually learn about things that I overlooked or failed to understand in the novel.",books,3516

"I read ebooks and listen to audiobooks and enjoy both for different reasons; however, I often see complaints that ""listening to an audiobook isn't \*really\* reading"".  I thought it might be fun to tackle that discussion another way.  

(from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test)) The **Turing test**, developed by [Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing) in 1950, is a test of a machine's ability to [exhibit intelligent behaviour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human.  

It's the idea that a sufficiently advanced machine may some day be able to converse with a human in a way that doesn't reveal to the human that the correspondent is actually a machine.  

To bend that theme to another purpose, do you think it's possible for an imaginary group of people - some who have read a book in the traditional sense and some who have listened to the audiobook - to hold an in-depth discussion about a book without giving away their method of reading?  Why or why not?  If you were a party to the discussion, would you be able to determine each person's method of reading without asking them direct questions about narration or reading process?  

If you would be able to tell the difference, are the differences meaningful?

"Last week I read [Vampires: The Recent Undead](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11728724-vampires) by Paula Guran (ed.), which collects a variety of short stories centered around vampires. The collection itself was pretty good and I was especially intrigued by all the different variations of vampires presented in the stories. After finishing it, I decided to go back to one of the more classical vampires books, namely *Carmilla* by Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu. 

*Carmilla* is Laura's retelling of the events surrounding the stay Carmilla had at Laura and her father's home in Styria. While Laura and Carmilla grow closer to each other, strange deaths are plaguing the surrounding area. Then Laura starts to have nightmares and falls ill herself. 

*Carmilla* was published in 1872 and pre-dates *Dracula* by 26 years. Why is that important? Well, first off because a lot of the tag lines for the book mention Dracula (""Before Dracula, there was Carmilla"", ""Le Fanu‚Äôs 1872 vampire tale is in many ways the overlooked older sister of Bram Stoker‚Äôs more acclaimed Dracula*"",* etc.) But I think it is also important to keep in mind when *Carmilla* was written and published because since the publication of *Carmilla* and *Dracula* vampire lore has been spun in a lot of different directions. Vampires have a place in a lot of cultures in one shape or another and we have encountered a lot of different iterations of vampires and vampire stories, from scary vampires to glittery vampires. This is a very long introduction to me talking about what I thought about *Carmilla.*

For someone that has a minimal exposure to vampires *Carmilla* is not scary, surprising or unique... by modern standards, so if that is what you are looking for in a vampire story there are better books out there. So in that regard *Carmilla* doesn't stand out, but I do think *Carmilla* is intriguing to read as it is one of the works that forms the basis of the genre we know now. In that regard *Carmilla* introduces several familiar aspects of the vampire story, the stranger arriving, the slight disbelieve of the supernatural, the sexual elements to vampires and I do think it is worth reading to see those aspects of the lore vampire being introduced. On top of that, it is also a pretty decent story.

If you have read *Carmilla*, what did you think of it? When you read older books, that are part of the start of a genre, do you keep in mind that they were written before modern works and does that influence how you judge the book?",books,2516

"I always liked reading books, especially magic and fairy types, from childhood. But couldn't get to read one, as I couldn't properly explain the type of books I wanted to my parents and they ended up getting some devotional books (which I felt was quite boring), and, I was too scared to borrow one from my school library (I just thought that they would be given to only the famous and the nerdy ones, as I wasn't both never got the courage to ask one).
But during my middle school,I borrowed books and read them, like many books,it was so fun. Read a lot after that, usually borrowed one.

I LOVED both Pet Sematary and The Shining. I read them each in just a few days. But Doctor Sleep really seemed to drag on after the first 200 pages or so.

They‚Äôre silly nicknames probably didn‚Äôt help. They never seemed to have the upper hand and were killed off pretty easily by the protagonist. 

I was just really missing that tension that The Shining had, that feeling that you don‚Äôt know who will live or die. Abra seemed way to strong for the danger she was in to have any stakes. That being said I really liked  the ending.

I (22F) think there is some kind of man-code (masculinity complex?) that keeps men in my area from delving into a novel because I have never met a man who reads (or admits that they read), excluding my own father (that is, if I asked). Does anyone know why this is? 

I did my undergrad in rural Illinois, and ran into the same problem: I literally cannot think of a single boy or man I've met who has ever truly enjoyed a novel and admitted it afterward. And for the ones who *have* consistently read in their lives (usually fished out of my history graduate courses), it's usually been nonfiction: WWII, John Adams, or (rarely) anarchist/communist political theory. What's up with that? 

I have found that dating men who don't read just results in a lot of confusion from them: ""What are you doing awake at *three o'clock in the morning?""  -*""It's a really good book.""-  ""*What does that matter???""* and so on.",books,1017
"Hello all, I hope everyone is doing wonderful today!

I will begin this post by saying I am a major bookworm, even with working 40-60 hours a week, taking care of 6 horses, a dog and a cat I still find time to read 1-3 books a week, dependent on the length and how into them I get.

That being said, I am having a shutdown coming up at work, 12-16 hours a day for up to three weeks servicing machines in a building that can get as hot as 140 degrees Fahrenheit .

So what I am looking for are quick reads that don't require a huge amount of brain work. I'm not looking for an 1800 page epic involving 57 main characters or a 700 page mystery that leaves you guessing right up until the end. Not compindiums of 17 books that you can mix and match the order of and still understand the plot. Not for the next few weeks at least.

What I'm looking for are some of your favorite reads from your teenage years. The inspiring sports stories, the short fantasy tales about the knights of the round table. Just something light and refreshing to satisfy my addiction while I am extremely limited on my time to read.

I look forward to hearing your suggestions and taking a trip back to the simpler plots and quick reads of memory lane! Thank you all for contributing to my habit.",books,1270

"Now this is again something which as a scientist you can‚Äôt prove, so I‚Äôm not trying to convince anybody. I‚Äôm trying to though speak up on behalf of or for those people for whom when they hear that they go, ‚ÄúI know that place. It doesn‚Äôt happen all the time, but I know that place.‚Äù

At a certain point William James talks about this when he‚Äôs writing about mystical experience. It‚Äôs noetic. It‚Äôs completely compelling for the person who has it, and it doesn‚Äôt change anything for the two of you.

To me it‚Äôs like teaching. When I‚Äôm teaching a class and I‚Äôm up at the blackboard, and I‚Äôm having my epiphanic moment in front of some differential equation and the students are all looking at me cross-eyed.

‚Ä¶but then you can see the one in the back all of a sudden just got it. Then the one in the front goes, ‚ÄúOh, I see that, too.‚Äù In other words, it can be contagious, but each one has to do it on their own. It‚Äôs a moment of insight. **Knowledge is not something you can just move across the table, and the other person has it.** It‚Äôs an invitation to exploration to think, to ideate.

Then there‚Äôs that ‚ÄúAha.‚Äù I think you could say that the moment I‚Äôm describing there is a moral analog of that moment. Sometimes it happens at the hand of a teacher. You might say a moral teacher or something of that or a moral dilemma that you‚Äôre in the middle of and you just can‚Äôt see your way through.

Then you make your steps and find that place where all of a sudden it gets clear. That doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt make mistakes. Somehow people think because you can make mistakes. To me if you can make a mistake then you can also not make a mistake. They come with each other.

"Hi r/books! 

Ever since I was really old enough to pick out my own chapter books, I was told to never, ever write in books. You don‚Äôt fold the pages either! Underlining, highlighting, note taking? All bad, if done in the book itself. Even writing your name under the book jacket‚Äôs inside flap.

Maybe the biggest reason I liked the character was because I felt extremely bad for him since it always seemed that he wanted to have the type of friendship that Jude and Willem had but neither of those two really seemed to want to have that with him. JB tried to be there for Jude (and Willem) but they didn't let him in the way they did with each other. The moment where JB kissed Jude at the gallery showed just how desperately he had wanted to be his best friend but always fell short. I understand how wrong it was for him to do so but I understood his feelings and could relate. What he did while he was on drugs to Jude was also horrible and I get how Jude couldn't forgive him but again, I sympathised with JB too.

"Just finished the series following a recommendation here and I gotta tell you... I‚Äôm so annoyed with it. It‚Äôs so frustrating that a great concept gets such unsatisfying treatment.
I have no complaints to the author as I respect anyone that can write a book and a series and she did an amazing job for what it is... 

But:
1. The characters are not believable (as well as flat and irrational) so no wonder that the best character there is actually the villain.
2. The plot twists... oh the twists. So many of them that I was TIRED just from reading them. Come on... give the reader some rest, some quiet time to enjoy the world you built (which is really great btw if only we got some more focus on it). Great battle scenes though. I bet it will film wonderfully. 
3. The writing... she‚Äôs a good writer all in all. Again, I‚Äôm not here to disrespect anyone‚Äôs work and I think she did a good job. She kept me interested and I did end up reading the whole 4 books in the series. Though the last 2 I forced myself into reading (I‚Äôm not a giver upper).

"In the past year or so I have really developed a taste for a very different type of novel than is my usual fare. I'm a big crime reader, although I am very selective about what I pick and tend to focus on atmosphere, character and prose over plotting; if a book does all of those well then that's a huge bonus. I also love vintage science fiction and the retro view of the future these books often explore.

But recently I've started to fall in love with what I like to call 'the quiet novel.' These are books in which little or next to nothing happens but are strong on atmosphere. Examples include the novels of Elizabeth Taylor (not the actress), Anita Brookner and Anne Tyler. The characters are generally ordinary people, the writing is not flowery but often has a beautiful simplicity. Even thought the novels don't tend to be particularly happy, there is frequently humour, although generally of the kind that makes you smile rather than laugh. And more than anything, there is a very keen perception of human nature. 

I'm currently reading **Olive Kitteridge** by Elizabeth Strout which fits into this category perfectly. This novel is essentially a series of interconnected short stories, often melancholic but written with a delicate warmth which saves them from being melodramatic or depressing. I am amazed how deep she burrows into the thoughts of her characters with such little word count, and lightly sketched details. 

These books have given me a real taste for a different kind of plotting. Sometimes it's what is left out that tells the best story, and sometimes implied action is more powerful than laboured exposition.",books,1641

 I read these books in the early 90s but they're very likely older than that, they are a series of fairy-tale anthologies with around 10 volumes.

Each volume had a different theme and were each associated with a different colour that would be used as accents on the cover and spine. From what I can remember there were a few stripes on the spine and possibly a border around the picture on the cover and each book was numbered.

That's all I remember but it would be nice to find them.

"""Sulking pays homage to a beautiful, dangerous ideal that can be traced back to our earliest childhoods: the promise of wordless understanding. In the womb, we never had to explain. Our every requirement was catered to. The right sort of comfort simply happened. Some of this idyll continued in our first years. We didn't have to make our every requirement known: large, kind people guessed for us. They saw past our tears, our inarticulacy, our confusions: they found the explanations for discomforts which we lacked the ability to verbalize.

That may be why, in relationships, even the most eloquent among us may instinctively prefer not to spell things out when out partners are at risk of failing to read us properly.

"Let me start this off by saying Stephen King is one of my favorite authors but this book wasn't his best work. First of all it was way to hard to follow, I mean there was to many things to follow at once. And I feel like what Beverly Marsh did to get the losers out of the tunnel didn't have to happen it was just too weird. Another thing is why did the God have to be a Turtle who died by choking on a galaxy he threw up (That's how the Milky way was created in the book). And Bill Denbrough beat Pennywise the first time by yelling something Bill learned in speech class. I wouldn't reccomend this book to anyone but Stephen King does have other good books like Misery or The Shining which are worth a read.",books,709

"I've been trying to diversify my reading a bit more lately and wonder what tactics others have used to change up their reading habits. 

For example, I've been considering out of every five books I read, one has to be re-read, one has to be nonfiction, two have to be fiction books that I already own but haven't read (I've been gifted books for years when I wasn't reading nearly as much and have a bit of a logjam), and one ""new"" fiction book that I purchase. 

Has anyone implemented a strategy like this? Does it work? 

Or if not, how much re-reading do you like to do? I feel like I've been missing out on some of my favorites trying to play catch up on those years that I hadn't been reading and I can get a little anxious if I'm reading what I perceive to be an old book I've already read while having roughly 25 or 30 books on my shelf that I haven't even touched.

My father was a former AP english teacher who lost his job a few years back due to budgetary cuts in the county he was teaching, since then he's been substitute teaching to help cover income but hes spent most his time writing short stories. He's always been writing something or another for as long as I can remember, but in particular since he lost his job he's focused on one series he intends on one day publishing called Outcast Island. 
He has a little author page he made on facebook for it, but outside of talking to me or my mother about his chapters as he writes them, no one including our close family and friends has really responded to his work and he gets bummed out by the radio silence. 
Lately hes gotten super discouraged about it, and the 30th is his 58th birthday so I figured I'd try and find somewhere to share his work with where it might get a little more attention??? I'm not a huge reader myself, sorta the black sheep as far as my family goes in that regard so I'm not sure of any forums or the like, so even if this post isn't neasicarily best suited here any input on where I might be able to post this and get some feedback for him other than my mom and I would he tremendously appreciated. 
I know this sounds like a really shitty ad for my own work, but I'm sure you can tell by my run on sentences despite my dad pushing for me to take AP english classes in high school I'm not exactly the most literate myself lmao. I'll be upfront and say the work itself involves a high school student who's tormented by bullies and personal life issues that may be a trigger for some people, it's an emotionally complex narrative that deals with trauma and the affect that can have on young adults. 
Like I said if this is the wrong place to post this I'm sorry for the spam, but please lmk if there's any sort of subreddit/forum that might be able to help provide a lil feedback for him. I have the PDF files on my phone and can post them somewhere or send them on request",books,2260

- the sister had a shape shifting cat companion who the brother has a crush on
- at one point the brother hooks up with a woman who has a pig tail
- I'm pretty sure there's a part where the brother is restrained for a long period of time and has to poop, and goes on about how you never think of people having to poop in survival situations?

It wasn‚Äôt until recently (halfway through undergrad) that I have started reading for fun again. I just learned about how people these days don‚Äôt read as much, because of the instant gratification from reading short blocks of text online. It makes you lose patience. For me, and a lot of other people, my brain goes into autopilot when I try to read more then... say 15 pages of a book and I completely forget what‚Äôs happening and have to read it over again.

"I just put down James Clavell's epic *Shogun* and I'm am absolutely impressed by the breadth and depth of it. I think it was incredible how you learn more about Feudal Japan along with Blackthorne. You start just as confused as he is. Their strange habits and brutal mannerisms are jarring at first but you really learn to appreciate the Feudal Japanese focus on honor, cleanliness, and manners while also coming to terms with the fatalism and rigidity of their culture. The book had a dizzying amount of characters and storylines that it made it feel like *Game of Thrones* in a single book!

"So I've been on a Wodehouse binge for the past couple of months and I just finished reading this one which, although has decent reviews on Goodreads, I found to be one of his weaker works especially considering the last three in the Blanding's castle series 

One thing that really annoyed me about this one was that a lot of the premise towards the later part of novel was focused on how once the manuscript written by Galahad is snatched away by your pilbeams/Parsloes the whole wedding arrangement between Ronnie Fish and Sue Brown would go awol

This brings me to such an obvious glaring plothole which just made it so difficult to completely immerse myself into the novel, what's stopping Galahad from simply writing his reminisces? You might argue that it would be a very time consuming work but he could simply threaten to write the Prawns story again and hold that as a leverage, it couldn't take that much time 

And such a large bulk of plot just depended on us taking it for granted that once the manuscript is destroyed/stolen there is no way Ronnie and Sue can ensconce themselves in a matrimonial arrangement anymore 

I recognise that it's a Wodehouse novel and the plot, if you decided to get real nitpicky with it, would always feel a little too convenient and a certain amount of suspended disbelief is required to enjoy the novels for what they are but this particular plothole just lent me incapable to keep my disbelief suspended anymore, it would've been alright if towards the end he would have alluded to the fact that Galahad could've simply rewritten his reminisces as a self aware joke but they never once mentioned it and for a writer like Wodehouse who usually answers questions that you sometimes face when reading his work, this just felt a little lazy on his part and slightly ruined, for me, what was a really funny novel",books,1854

"So the world in temeraire is basicaly ours but with dragons, but there is one thing that confused me in book 2.

And later in the series there is that raid at aimed at Laurence place and crew, and they repell almost a hundred guys with their guns and pistols , making the bandits/assaltants flee.

What i am trying to say here is that is implied that not only gunpowder(and guns for that matter) was introduced to china by other nations, they are not able to produce it themselves. But even though i am no expert i know that gunpowder and its predecessor the firework , was first made in china and from them to the rest of the world.

"So I just finished reading this strikingly absurd novel and initially, I wasn't into it but by the end I was practically tearing up with how depressing the whole thing was. I tried to piece together the whole story and what I forged is that it is Billy has these flashbacks  from the war and after the plane crash and his wife's death he goes absolutely insane and starts thinking about time as static to reassure himself that he is still happy somewhere in the timeline. The time travel parts are just flashbacks that he cannot get over and so it feels real. But how could the author know what really happened with Billy? Could it be that it's just what he experienced but in third person and filled with absurd sci fi concepts and character descriptions so the absurdity of war hides itself behind the absurdity of aliens and time travel and ponies fucking people, because it's difficult to talk about? I also think the lack of belief in free will and surrender to fate is another metaphor for the resignation one feels after fighting so long. Great book anyways, definitely recommend.",books,1087

"Historical figures like Muhammad Ali and Malcolm X were once members of the Nation of Islam, the black supremacist offshoot of Islam. The Nation was started in the United States by a man named Fard Muhammad, who is believed to be ‚ÄúGod in person‚Äù and it was taken over by Elijah Muhammad, who is believed to be the ‚Äúmessenger of God.‚Äù

Elijah Muhammad wrote numerous books, and I recently read one, titled *How to Eat to Live*. I personally do not believe in this religion, but that‚Äôs not the point of this post. I still think the book was really fascinating to read.

Two things are especially interesting about how the book is written.

Number one, the fact that this is even a book is kind of notable. The book doesn‚Äôt have that many novel instructions or explanations, and the meat and potatoes (no pun intended) could have been summarized into a five page manual. It could have read like this:

*‚ÄúI am a messenger of God. God told me to teach you people how to eat for good long-term health. Eat these foods: [list]. Don‚Äôt eat these foods: [list]. Here are some explanations behind the prohibitions/permissions: [list]. Eat only one meal a day. These are some tips on how to prepare your foods: [list]. These are some additional healthy habits: [list]. THE END.‚Äù*

Instead, the book is over a hundred pages long, and a lot of the exact same points are repeated over and over again in various different chapters. For example, the book spends so much time repeating how eating pork is ‚Äúdivinely-prohibited‚Äù and how it is not good for human consumption. He brings that up at least ten different times, probably more. Several chapters are about pork alone, though to be fair the chapters are only about two or three pages long anyway. This repetition makes it easier to remember the main points, kind of like an annoying story your dad has told you 28,000 times that you‚Äôll never forget.

Number two, you can easily hear Elijah Muhammad‚Äôs voice while reading this book. Elijah Muhammad‚Äôs formal education ended at third grade, and reading this book, you can tell it wasn‚Äôt written by a PhD. That alone doesn‚Äôt make the information more or less credible (the credibility comes down to your religious beliefs which are not the point of this post). I think it was a good decision not to hire a professional editor to make the grammar/syntax more professional, and to correct the spelling/grammar mistakes. Having heard some of Elijah Muhammad‚Äôs interviews, the book is written exactly how he would speak. If the book read like a professional textbook, it would feel much less authentic.

How you feel about the content in the book comes down to your beliefs, and I don‚Äôt think that part is all too interesting, but the way the book is written is fascinating.",books,2755

"Hello dreamers, here's another review from another chapter of The Witcher: The last wish. 

‚ñ∂Ô∏èThe story begins when Geralt looks for a shorter path in a valley and notices birds circling a particular area in the nearby forest. He finds the dead bodies of a merchant and a young woman, and follows the path from where they probably came to a rundown mansion surrounded by a high wall and a gate. In the courtyard, Geralt notices a fountain with a dolphin statue in white stone, and a remarkable rose bush with indigo flowers. His attention is soon distracted by the sound of a rushing beast. Shortly afterwards, Geralt comes face to face with the current owner of the manor, Nivellen, who at first sight is more beast than man. The creature then invites our witcher in, where they dine and talk about his story, his father and grandfather, and their relationship and how he has spent the last twelve years cursed.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è In this story we will know more about Geralt's charachter, through this conversation he had with Nivelllen we see what kind of men Geralt of Rivia is, what he thinks about monsters killing monsters and his rules when it comes to killing them.

‚ñ∂Ô∏èThis chapter was one of my favorite, first because it reminds me of the tale Beauty and the Beast, secondly the conversation they had Geralt and Nivellen was full of emotions and deep beautifull thoughts; in this particular world people very often think that things are either black or white, there is nothing in between,a creature can be good or evil, and it's not necessary like that, it's more of specturn and there is a lot of shades of grey on it, and the big question is when it comes to monsters, where on the specturn do you place them and this is something that Geralt struggles with queit a lot.

When can observe him talking about this little more in this chapter, also this stories kind of raise a lot of questions about love and sacrifice, and what true love means, furthermore monsters actually can feel it and they can love care as well.",books,2015

"I‚Äôve been looking for the perfect Bible to put in my desert island library. I have been looking at the Bibliotheca Bible which has the books split up into 5 books with different themes and a reader Bible that formats the Bible like a regular book without notes and verses.  

This got me thinking of books that are several works in one, like Shakespeare. I have a Canterbury classics edition of Mark Twain with several novels together and I‚Äôm going to get the deluxe edition of The Lord of the Rings. I like that compendiums save space, but I like individual books because they usually have notes which I like because they help give a deeper appreciation of the material.

"I love reading them and wish more books had them. They feel so personal, in a way, and coupled with the fact that some of these authors are no longer with us seems very kind and gentle in a way. The relationship between author and reader is kind of strange in that they never meet and it's usually a one-sided relationship, so in a ways it feels deeply personal and kind.",books,371

"After reading this book, I felt humbled by the journey of David through childhood. I thought about his progression from an innocent child to a fully grown adult, how he changed, what he did and what he lost.   That fact made me reflect on my own life, on what I could do and what I could be. I only just turned a teenager, however, I feel as if I need to be able to portray my life as a story- to have a purpose and something to tell when I approach old age. The life of David Copperfield in the story is just so poetic and wonderful, the relationships are particularly special to me. 

I am sorry for rambling, however, I want to express my love for the book and not spoil it in the process.
It earned a place in my heart and I hope the same for others. Thank you for reading my post and have a good day.",books,805

"Like probably many of you, I have a lists of books I want to read. I have a few simple categories (non-fiction, classics and non-classics). I usually read 2 or 3 books at the same time and usually try to balance within the categories based on my mood. 

Now certain moods are what make me pick books from my to read list. Non-fiction and classics are pretty set mostly. The ‚Äònon-classic‚Äô category is the most flexible. Mostly fantasy, sci-fi and some guilty pleasures. 

I do research before I start a book (no tooo much because spoilers) especially for that last category, because that is very closely connected to a type of mood. 

I have a simple methode, I check reddit and I check goodreads. On goodreads I read the most populair one or two star reviews. If the thing that the person disliked most about the book is something I like, we have a match if its something I too would dislike, I move away. 

But I‚Äôm finding that it can be sooo off sometimes. How do you guys pick the next book? Anyone like me choose based on mood and do have you found a method that works?",books,1073

"I haven‚Äôt read any Stephen King since middle school in the 90s when I read Carrie and The Shining. I remember liking them both, especially The Shining. Haven‚Äôt had any desire to read him since. Then, I saw HBO doing The Outsider and I figured, that seems like a cool premise, I bet the book is good, so I‚Äôll hold off on the show, read the book first, and then give it a good binge. I started the book and it was real page turner quality. For the first 300 pages or so. I haven‚Äôt read a book that fell off this hard in a while. First of all, I‚Äôve said this since I was a kid and it‚Äôs still true: no book needs to be over 500 pages. There are few exceptions... non fiction, mostly. 

Anyway, the story had promise and I couldn‚Äôt put it down but a couple things made the second half hard to get through. First, I‚Äôve read criticism of King and his use of ‚Äúdeus ex machina‚Äù. This definitely fits the bill. There‚Äôs a mystery at the center of the story, but when King gives us the answer to the mystery, that is, how Terry Maitland was in two places at the same time... it‚Äôs just dumb. Or at least, it‚Äôs written in a completely uninteresting way. Which brings me to the next aspect that made it hard to get through: his prose. I just found the writing, the actual language, not great, especially the dialogue. After finishing my first Elmore Leonard book and then reading King‚Äôs dialogue I was underwhelmed to say the least. Pretty cliched dialogue and I was shocked that someone who has written 60 books and is held in such high regard (even for a pop writer) would write dialogue like that. 

I have the feeling Kong‚Äôs work is much better suited to the screen. Like he has great ideas and builds a great story, but it works best when adapted for the screen and given better dialogue and the characters are able to come to life more. 

Anyway... it wasn‚Äôt all bad. Just really could have used some better dialogue and shaved off about 120-150 pages. 

I welcome any combating criticism.",books,1980
"I dont read much cause I find it hard to stay interested in a book. However, I love Fyodor Dostoevsky‚Äôs work. I‚Äôve read a few of his books including: The Brothers Karamazov, Crime and Punishment, The Adolescent, etc. I love reading his books because not only is the story interesting, but I love the philosophical conversations between characters. It leaves me thinking about the ideas introduced and I enjoy that. I find his views on religion, society, human behavior, etc interesting and especially how he brings up these ideas in the book through conversations between characters, etc.

However, I wanna look into other authors as well who have a similar writing style. Its been hard finding books im interested in. So could you suggest any authors or books similar to those of Dostoevsky? I dont have much to do during quarantine so id like to pick up a new book....",books,870
"Hey fellas,  


I (M20) am from Germany and I love learning languages more than anything else. I have been learning English in school since I was about 9 and French since I was 11. When I was 15 I dropped out of the English class in favor of French because I only ever got Bs in English and in French I had my consistent As. However around that time I started to immerse myself in English content on YouTube and the rest of the internet more and more and thus my English of course continued to develop. After school I worked as a food delivery driver for two years. During that time I came into contact with more and more people who didn't speak any German and I had to start talking English which was quite uncomfortable for me at the beginning, but it slowly started getting better and now I'm talking English every single day because my SO of one year is Russian and I don't speak Russian (yet!).  


My ""problem"" is that I would like to reach a native-like proficiency one day and I feel like I am not quite there yet. I sometimes feel like I can't express myself the way I want to in my native language, which is totally natural for sure, but it motivates me to get better and that's a good thing, right? I know that reading is very important for developing language skills and I kinda stopped reading in my late teenage years when I got my first laptop and began to play more games and watch more youtube, but I am reading a lot of English texts these days, however they are mostly academical and don't really provide me with anything that's useful for my communicative needs.   


So my question is, can you recommend any books to me that are interesting to read and have a sophisticated but natural style? Maybe something that you loved to read when you were teenagers? I don't care much about the content but in my childhood days I read a lot of high fantasy.  


I am excited for all your recommendations and hope to try as many as possible of them.",books,1959
"I'll try and keep this as short as possible, but I'm getting extremely fed up with Book Depository and I never thought a company would stoop to what they're doing to me.

About 3 weeks ago, I placed an order for 6 books (a little over $100). They were all 10 year anniversaries for some fantasy books. It took 2 weeks for me to receive them all one by one since they were all packaged separately. My biggest issue was that one of the last packages that I received wasn't mine. The package has someone else's name on it, but it has my name and tracking label tacked on the old label. Inside was a book I've never heard of. The next issue which is minor in comparison is that 3 out of the 5 books I received were damaged. Bent and broken spines, with the book texture fading as if it was thrown across the floor and against walls.

So last Monday (exactly one week ago) I filled out the customer service form and explained all this and offered to send pictures. It took them two days to respond which is understandable because they send automatic emails saying they are getting to everyone asap due to the pandemic. Again, understandable. When they responded, they asked for the pictures, which I responded to almost immediately. I also send a picture of the package that wasn't mine but has two names on it (mine and a stranger's in another state). They responded within the hour and apologized, but their solution: 25% refund on only the damaged books (about $15 even though I spent over 100). They didn't even acknowledge the missing book! 

I responded within a few minutes, and without acknowledging the small refund offer, I asked what about the book that was missing? Radio silence for 48 hours. Between the 48 hours, I send 2 responses asking if I responded correctly. When 48 hours hit, I made them aware that I'll just send another email customer service request. So on Friday (4 days after my original request), I sent another email request. Suffice to say, they never responded to that one either. 

Sunday morning I finally got a response to the original email. This time it was another person. Their exact response: ""I'm contacting you on behalf of my colleague who is out of the office at this time. I am afraid we are unable to reorder items due to the pandemic. Please advise if you accept the 25%¬† refund?"" 

Wait, what?! They're refusing to replace orders during the pandemic? Me being very frustrated at this point since it's been 6 days since I first contacted Book Depository, this was my exact response and I admit I was probably too blunt: ""This does not resolve my issue of a missing book, so you would need to reorder for me anyway. I received someone else‚Äôs package.""

It took them about 12 hours to respond (Sunday evening around 11 pm). They apologized and asked me to send them yet more info. They asked for 3 specific things. The order number on the slip inside the stranger's package. The book title. And the ISBN number. At this point, I knew they didn't believe me, but I tagged along and didn't want to drag it on more than I had to. So I sent them the info and also a picture of the package (again) with the book right next to it this time. 

At this point, I felt a bit hopeful since they were finally acknowledging the missing book. That hope disappeared when I woke up this morning to this email: 

""**Shabana.R** (Book Depository)

Jul 27, 2020, 7:48 AM GMT+1

As this is an Amazon order, kindly contact us through an Amazon platform so that we may assist with this.¬†  
Kindly confirm if you require further assistance regarding BDU-\[removed my order number\] and BDU-\[removed my order number\]?¬†  


Kind regards,

Shabana.R  
Customer Advisor'

At this point, you can only assume how angry I am. I responded by saying that of course I still have an issue with my original request. I'm stuck with 3 defected books and a missing book while I'm stuck with someone else's order. I told them that it makes no sense for me to contact Amazon for someone else's order! I asked them to empathize with me because this is ridiculous. 

Sorry for the long rant, but I am looking for advice. What should I do? Wait to see if they respond or maybe even respond to the second email request I sent all the way back on Friday? Should I contact my credit card company to dispute the charge? This is definitely the final nail in the coffin for me with Book Depository - I thought I gave up on them last year when they repeatedly would not print my apartment number on my packages (after a month I intercepted the postal service myself), but that's another story.

"Hello all! Reading has always been my escape, or say, my leisure. The first three years of reading english (and comparative) literature at uni was well (the first was exceptionally exciting). But now, in my 5th (and last) year I'm burnt-out. I don't just mean I'm tired of reading, but I find no pleasure in reading anything. I find no emotion in everything I read. My biggest problem is I have to finish my undergraduate thesis (on Joyce, no less - inadvertently made it harder for myself) and I seem to be stuck, or I've, somewhat, dug myself into a hole.

"To preface this, I haven't yet seen the Netflix adaptation of this book. I watched a documentary called One Of Us, which followed the lives of several Hasidic Jewish people who attempted to or succeeded in leaving their communities, and after it finished the trailer for UNORTHODOX came up. I thought it looked interesting but decided to read the book before giving the show a try. 

The author comes across as someone who thinks *very highly* of herself. She is disdainful towards her extended family members, her schoolmates, her mentally deficient father (for whom she shows no compassion or attempt at understanding, but only derides him for a severe intellectual impairment that even she acknowledges is not his fault) and even towards her mother, despite the fact that her mother also succeeding in leaving the community. 

&gt;Looking at my mother, I understand that there might be similarities between us, but the differences are more glaringly obvious. Her journey speaks more of a struggle for security than for happiness. Our dreams hover above us like clouds, and mine seem bigger and fluffier than her wispy strip of cirrus.

It seems she has never met anyone who is not deserving of her self-righteous attitude, especially those who she perceives to be less ambitious than herself.

&gt;I have always wanted everything life can possibly give me, and this desire separates me from people who are willing to settle for less. I cannot even comprehend how people's desires can be small, their ambitions narrow and limited.

I also found the description of her admittedly stressful family dynamic to be a bit hypocritical....

&gt;In this family, we watch each other closely, ever ready to point out someone's spiritual or physical failing. This, says \[her aunt\] is compassion - compassion for someone's spiritual welfare.

But on the very next page, she says about herself

&gt;I try, but I can't help my natural impulse to talk back. I cannot allow another's mistake to pass by unnoticed. 

I would say this is learned behavior from a highly critical upbringing which, ideally, she would acknowledge to be wrong. (Think narcissists and fleas) But the second quote is indulgently presented as if she is only being high-spirited and free-thinking by constantly correcting the mistakes of others. She doesn't seem to realize the irony in her thinking that kind of behavior is abusive when it comes from her family, but admirable when it comes from her. 

I'm interested in hearing the thoughts of others. I want to enjoy this book, but so far I'm finding it easy to put down and difficult to pick up again.",books,2616

"I have got a lot of criticism for saying this but: in my opinion, most of the people who read audiobooks do it out of sheer laziness.

I say most, because I have realised that audiobook is a great tool for blind people and people with certain disabilities. I was excluding them first, but I have realised this mistake and so, I celebrate the existence of audiobook, and how it helps them experience literature. 

But those of you out there who can perfectly read: pick. a. fucking. book.

Don't use disabled people as a way to justify your laziness and philistinism. That is, in fact, more insulting to them. Considering how much I ruffled some feathers a while ago, it seems most of you deep inside *know* that you're being lazy and uncultured, and that's why you feel so defensive. I swear I haven't gotten such bad backlash even for political disagreements.

"I‚Äôm a minimalist in progress. That‚Äôs what I call myself not because I have a set number for how many items I should own, but because I haven‚Äôt let go of many things I should yet.

I‚Äôve been stuck here for a few years now, and I keep getting stuck with my physical book collection. I have been reading and collecting physical books since I was a child, but through the years I‚Äôve donated some to the local library and sold some due to the lack of shelf space. 

I keep hearing people who are in their journey to be more minimalist by saying they can‚Äôt let go of their books. I‚Äôm not here to tell you should let go of them. That‚Äôs a personal decision and I have no authority to make that decision for you.

But I did notice that in quarantine, staring at my overloaded bookshelf, that they give me so much emotional weight and take up so much mental space. I asked mysed: Why can‚Äôt I let more go? Then I realized that I was attached to the idea that my physical book collection is a part of my identity, and I reconciled that I am more than just the fullness of my shelves.

One day I took out ALL my books from my shelves and evaluated. There are A LOT of books I thorughly enjoyed but now I won‚Äôt read them again. The fact that they have sat there for more than five years and I haven‚Äôt picked them up since I bought them is a good enough sign. There are books I bought but never read and will never read, books I read and never finished and will never finish.

Gone are the days of me feeling guilty of letting books go. I‚Äôve opened up my online bookstore to rehome these books. It‚Äôs a slow process. Some days I realize that there are books I overlooked and need to let go of too. I have enjoyed most of them once or maybe multiple times, and it‚Äôs someone else‚Äôs time now.

"So I know that sunning is bad for books and that your library should not be in direct sunlight, mine isn't. However, I like to read books outside and took my new book ""The Last Wish"" by Andrej Sapkowski a few times when I was going to relax by the river so I could take a dip anytime I was feeling hot while reading.  Unfortunately, this seemed to mess up the glue in the spine and groups of pages are not just falling out of it.  Sometimes single pages, but more often groups of 10-20.  And this only happened in the latter half of the book, so it seemed to happen over time, not immediately.  It also seemed to be worn directly on the spine and now, bending the spine to open the pages farther causes more damage, so I'm stuck reading the book by only opening it with the smallest opening angle possible.  I tried some superglue but things got a bit messy.   I also thought that reading on my back with the spine facing the sun could've possibly melted the glue because this was what I was doing when it first happened.  Now I'm worried to read anymore books outside because I don't want to ruin them! How do you deal with reading outside during the summer and not ruining them?

"Currently, I cannot think of myself reading e-books. For one, I LOVE ""physical books"", I love their touch, their papers, and most of all I love acquiring them (and adding them to my library). In addition, I hate holding tabs/phones for a long time, primarily because I'd always drift into some of the social media apps, even for a few seconds, it would distract me. 

On the other hand, I realise I must overcome these points should I want to access a greater library. Four months ago, I've come back to my country (Middle East) and since then only Arabic books were accessible to me. Under this pandemic situation, I've had to improvise and read the books in the house, after that I've started buying books from different bookstores in the city. I've read over 20 Arabic books in the last 70 days. All the while, I've packed massive interest in numerous English books. Novels and others, too. The problem is that there is only one bookshop that sells English books, and it doesn't have that many books. 

For both more accessibility and fewer expenses, I would like to be open to e-reading. I am 21 years old and have only been actively reading for 5 years. Which is why I know I lack much experience, I would love to get your opinion and your experience in transitioning to e-reading.",books,1286

"You can see here all the books I've read in 2020: [image](https://shelf.li/9.png)

As you can see, they are all fantasy, most of them tending towards epic fantasy. The Authors aren't diverse either. Hobb is the only woman and I think all are/were white americans/australians.

This is because I just bought/read what ever I found interesting in a bookshop or I saw a review online that sparked my interest and until now never considered reading something for a specific reason (other than that I might like it), but now you see a lot of people posting their list of really diverse books/authors (I have seen this especially since the BLM movement gained a lot of attention in media. I am not really directly affected though since i am from the EU)

How important do you think it is, to read diverse books? Whether it is genre, author (gender, ethnicity) or something else, I am curious to read your thoughts!",books,908
"I've read the canon, I've watched all the major dramatizations (Rathbone, Jeremy Brett, Downey Jr., Cumberbatch) and I love them , no doubt. However, when you compare all this to a detective like Hercule Poirot whose stories are far more engaging, characters equally endearing (and sometimes more. The original Sherlock Holmes stories, if I remember correctly, had what were practically cardboard characters standing in just to further the plot) far superior in terms of the actual content. Poirot has his own share of wild, unsatisfying stories but even the worst of them are more riveting than some of Holmes. 

Couple that with David Suchet's magnificent dramatization and you have an absolute winner between the two, in my opinion.",books,735
"Preface: I adored this series. I ordered the first book, All Systems Red, in hard copy, then got each subsequent book on Kindle as I finished them because I refused to wait for the next to arrive. I am now stuck waiting until next April for the next installment, so in the meantime, I figured I would put together my case for why these books are so freaking awesome. 

Reason 1: Page-turning action. Over the course of four novellas and a full-length novel, there was a noticeable lack of repetition. Every new scenario was difficult, interesting, and unique in the way it was presented and in the way it was solved by Murderbot and its companions. I always wanted to know what was going to happen next, and I never felt let down or disappointed. It also really helped that I liked and/or became invested in pretty much all the characters, and I genuinely cared about how things would turn out for them. Hence motoring through the entire series without breaks. 

Reason 2: Philosophically interesting content. I am apparently becoming a fan of the robot/AI-discovers-its-own-humanity genre. (Other favorite recent example: A Closed and Common Orbit by Becky Chambers.) This series raised questions of consciousness, personhood, and ethics without being preachy or wallowing in the metaphysical mire - see above re: heart-pounding action. 

Reason 3: Representation without tokenism. The main character is agender and asexual (sex-repulsed). In the world of the books, it is apparently commonplace for people to have multiple spouses (referred to as marital partners), and more than two genders are recognized. Nevertheless, it‚Äôs never really ‚Äòa thing‚Äô, and the story is ultimately focused on Murderbot trying to keep humans alive while they insist on doing things that will get them killed. It‚Äôs representation done really exceptionally well. 

Reason 4: Painfully relatable depiction of social anxiety. The protagonist/narrator suffers from deeply rooted anxiety related to feelings and conversations. It‚Äôs honestly the most relatable portrayal I‚Äôve ever encountered, as someone with similar difficulties - I‚Äôve often wished I could turn off my feelings and just live hyper-logically, because strong feelings are uncontrollable and therefore scary. At the same time, the author shows that Murderbot‚Äôs anxiety does not disqualify it from being a valued friend and teammate. Further, Murderbot is constantly saving everybody else from themselves, despite its inability to handle feelings and physical touch. There is comfort in feeling seen and also seeing myself in such a compelling and competent character. 

Conclusion: Once again, I loved these books, and if any or all of the above appeal to you, I think you will too. 10/10, highly recommend.",books,2748
"Anyone else experience this? I recently read a book called The Poppy War. Flat-out one of the best books I ever read, and I've read *a lot*. The writing was brilliant, pacing almost perfect, characterization on point. Loved it. Highly, highly recommend it.

Second book came out, and...yikes. Writing took a nosedive. Pacing very erratic. Characters became hollow. 

It made me sad, but not quite surprised. I realized that what likely happened was with the first book, the writer had to deal with a strict editor who helped her work through it. But after it exploded in popularity, either the writer or the publishing company didn't think an editor was needed anymore, and the writer got free reign to do whatever she wanted. And it shows. 

A lot of people point to A Song of Ice and Fire as another example, where so much could have been cut, but because Martin has nobody to answer to, it all gets included. End result is very little actual plot progression. 

Anyone got their own examples of this?",books,1003
"
Panzer‚Äôs Phantom will be about a German tank crew who at the end of the Second World War gets trapped behind enemy lines.  They were given a suicide fight to the last man order before they were sent out against the Soviets one last time.  They were the only ones in their unit to survive as the crew and their tank goes into hiding.  

They then loose their radio and thus did not hear the surrender order of Nazi Germany so they continue to harass Soviet truck movements and raid villages.  Over a month later they find a newspaper in the town and a Russian fluent member reads the headline as War is over! Victory in Europe as Germany falls!  The crew then realizes their plundering was for nothing and they must fight or sneak their way back home to the west as the Americans will be more forgiving then the Russians.  Several crew members die and the tank breaks down along the way but then they make it to the west german border.  

They make one last attack as they charge the Soviet border patrol with everything they have as the American tanks look onward at this several month old ghost from WW2 attacks and ravages the Soviet border guards and as the guns fall silent they roll toward the American lines then the book ends with the tank throwing a track and the tattered remaining crew surrenders to the Americans.  The title Phantom‚Äôs Panzer has a double meaning as the tank is a ghost from a prior conflict but also a ghost because of how the tank alluded the soviets. 

What do you think of my story premise? There are further details I left out here to keep the post short such as how the tank is repaired, character interactions etc but if anyone is interested I can add that in a reply post.",books,1708

"Did i get your attention? Hella.   
I'll TLDR but add some details after the fact for anyone who would like more. 

*I can't listen to people reading, simply because I can't listen to a* ***single*** *person reading.* 

And that's my dilemma. I love audio stories, dramas and plays. And I love listening to them but something about just a single person droning on, making voices for every character than only sounds subtly different to move forward a narrative most of which I have no help besides his droning words to imagine and experience . . .

You see my point? Right?

I need the intrigue of sound effects, multiple actors playing astounding personalities, all interacting with each in a way that feels more natural than a monologue does. The Sound effects, the scripting, the laughter and adventure and intrigue. Even the background music! It's what keeps me alive and grinning from ear to ear. 

*And most audiobooks just don't do that.* 

It's like not enough work was put into them, even if logically I know that is certainly not the case.

\*Dungeons and Daddies

\*NADDPOD",books,1117
"Don‚Äôt get me wrong: the writing is well done. I believe he captures the way people talked in the mid-1800s. It feels very genuine. And he is extremely descriptive. I could certain see, in my mind‚Äôs eye, what was happening, where everyone was, what the scene looked like. 

However 

There is no plot. There are no characters to root for. There are no twists or revelations. There is no growth. And short of an extremely cynical speech in the last 15 pages, there isn‚Äôt any philosophy espoused either. 

It‚Äôs basically just a running account of a team of scalpers. Monsters, all of them. And then they‚Äôre all dead except for the judge. 

I‚Äôve always read, too, that he‚Äôs this extremely diabolical character, scarier than Hannibal Lecter or Anton Chigurh or whoever. But honestly, he isn‚Äôt. He kills two puppies and a cat, and frames a minister as a pedophile, but that‚Äôs about it in terms of being different than any of the other characters. I didn‚Äôt find him particularly frightening, certainly he‚Äôs not on par with the Tooth Fairy in Manhunter or some random Stephen King villain. 

I guess I just don‚Äôt get why that book gets so much love. It‚Äôs just group travels to here, kills everyone, travels to another spot, kills everyone, travels to another spot, kills everyone ...... then everyone‚Äôs dead. Big deal.

Before reading however, I noticed that I bought an ‚Äúextended edition‚Äù of the book (I‚Äôm not sure the exact terminology used, but in the pretext of the book King says that there are some scenes in the book that were added after the original print).

"When I was a kid, I read a lot. My mother instilled a love of books in me. As I got older, I found I am drawn to reading nonfiction historical books and memoirs. I've especially been reading a lots of the nonfiction since going back to school. But I've also discovered that I have a hard time getting into fantasy and sci-fi books now. 

There was one book my SO has been trying to get me to read for a few years now, and while I would read a chapter or two, and generally enjoyed it, I just could never stick with it. Then I picked it up in audiobook form, and it's been amazing! The narrator is really good, and while I don't always love his character voices, I've found myself more immersed in this book than I ever would have been otherwise. I can't wait to listen to more of it and my SO has been excited about being able to relisten to them with me.

So if there's a book you've really been wanting to read, but struggling to, maybe try it in a different format. I feel like I could actually reread Lord of the Rings if I got them in audiobook form.

Any comments or criticism is highly appreciated.

The story starts when he just passed his 12th standard and now entering college life. The result was so unfortunate they lost all hope of getting admission anywhere. The day was ruined, just like the expectations of his parents. They wanted him to be a doctor, but apparently, the percentage he got was not sufficient. The admission season started, and they had to opt for the second-best option, which was pharmacy back then. The time was passing by, they were making memories, but on the other hand, Aditya was thinking of creating his way. He always wanted to start his brand, his business empire, way before startup was a cool thing. He explained his plan to his friends, and they decided to start a business together. The real question they were facing was, what to do? They had no money or background, which can help them survive in cut-throat competition, but still, they wanted to swim in unknown water.
To give their brand identity, they decided to go for a company name. They founded a company with a smaller budget and faced legal and financial problems during that time. Just like most company founders, there was a moment that led to breaking up, and they decided to part their ways. Aditya's grandfather was highly interested in business, so he suggested to start his firm. He financed him for a new start, and they formed another company. The money was invested, legal status was approved, but the next phase of recovery was not known to him. Thus, Aditya started making different efforts to get the return for the investment, and he decided to start his magazine.
The magazine gained him fame in his college and among his classmates, but the business model was not successful yet. Along the road, he started recruiting volunteers for the magazine who can write useful articles for the same. He met and convinced a few students from the college, and then he met Anamika.
They were a partner in each other's projects. This allowed the bond to grow much stronger between them and laid the foundation of a strong friendship. Meanwhile, on the other hand, he tried to deal with documentation related to the company and other legal aspects. They both had feelings, but they were waiting for another one to address the elephant in the room. It was the final year, and people were deciding future goals, and here they were deciding whether to express their feelings or not. So many feelings but very few to zero words to explain it. The relationship was at the pinnacle of curiosity. The problem was, who should take the risky step of asking? Since denial is feared by great personalities as well, these were ordinary adults.
Ultimately somehow they managed to break the ice and addressed the elephant in the room. They passed through phase of euphoria and experienced la la land of love. As everything has its shelf life, the college days ended and it was time to look at the future, instead of each others face. Now their problems changed from finding location for their hideout to perfect college where they can be together and maintain the relation at its peak. The days of togetherness came to a tragic end, and on the other hand, his parents started noticing unusual behavior in him. They knew he was up to something, and they did not like it. The hunt for college admission begun, on the other hand, and he applied in IITs and Pharmacy colleges across countries and whatnot. To fill the new light in their life, he decided to do something on their graduation day, which might change things between them forever. On the day of graduation, he handed her a letter and told her to open it when she goes back. Will they be together? Will they survive the separation? That is the part of life, which all have to endure.",books,4070

"Today, I learned that the word ""tsundoku"" refers to the habit of buying books and letting them pile up but never reading them all.  I'd heard the word ""bibliomania"" before--I think it's used a lot on this subreddit, but I also learned something new. 

So, according to [Open Culture](http://www.openculture.com/2018/07/tsundoku.html), ""The word dates back to the very beginning of modern Japan, the Meiji era (1868-1912) and has its origins in a pun. *Tsundoku*, which literally means reading pile, is written in Japanese as Á©ç„ÇìË™≠. *Tsunde oku* means to let something pile up and is written Á©ç„Çì„Åß„Åä„Åè. Some wag around the turn of the century swapped out that *oku* („Åä„Åè) in *tsunde oku* for *doku* (Ë™≠) ‚Äì meaning to read. Then since *tsunde doku* is hard to say, the word got mushed together to form *tsundoku*."" 

When I started to look more into the term, I discovered that bibliomania--a term that emerged in the 1800s in the UK over people who obsessively collected books--inspired legitimate fear into people over not having enough time to read the books. While I always thought it was something about people having passion for books, according to [HuffPost](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/theres-a-japanese-word-for-people-who-buy-more-books-than-they-can-actually-read_n_58f79b7ae4b029063d364226), it was actually an issue of genuine concern.

"Let me preface this by saying I'm autistic, and that I've known this about myself for a long time.

Kurchak's book was honestly super validating for me. Although our childhood experiences obviously weren't identical (A concession Kurchak makes at the start of the book, the autistic experience is not universal.), a lot of the issues Kurchak had to deal with growing up were familiar to me. Issues such as the struggle to fit in with your peers, the lasting impacts of bullying and social isolation, the loss of identity that can come from changing one's self to fit in, the hatred of jeans, and the love for weird, niche things.

Although I'm far from being one of the worst victims of autism, the book helped me to come to terms with aspects of myself I've either ignored or forgotten about, and to be able to better recognize the things I still struggle with. I've gone through so many crises completely on my own, and the feeling that someone else has gone through the same things makes that cross so much easier to bear.

If any of you are living with autism, or would like some very candid insight into the life experience of someone with autism, I'd definitely recommend the book. It's inspired me to write more than I have previously. There's so much I've left unsaid, it's about time I put it to words.",books,1311

I deeply regretted this decision as I had loved those books and spent ages 14 to 19 collecting those books from used bookstores and unused bookstoees. Like 3 bookshelves fu of books. But I was at the point where 40 dollars would help a lot and when I tried selling the books at higher prices no one would buy them and I was desperate for money. Anyways I'm now at a point where  I can buy the books back and I still had the contact info of the lady to whom I sold the books. And well she agreed to sell them back at a slightly higher price of 60. I only got a portion of the books back(she said she has them all over her house and will let me know when she has gathered all of them.) and I am really happy. But when I was unpacking the books I noticed they smelled like really bad. Like cigarette smoke and something else that I can't describe. When I opened the pages of one of them I gagged.

"I love a good game, book, movie, tv show but I've really started to appreciate the depth of story in books.  

I haven't been the biggest fan of ASOIF as they did drag on quite a bit but after reading the first 3 books, I really appreciate how George RR Martin does these deep character studies that is impossible to convey through the tv show. 

Simply put, you can't understand a character in a tv show as you can in a book. 

Another example is The Expanse tv show which is also adapted from a series of books. The tv show is great already but the books, while they do also drag on at times, introduce a new perspective for the reader.

It shows how based on human history, the human tendencies of greed, ambition, and love will always linger on everything humans touch in the universe.

So of course this has been come to be expected of books; how they delve deeper into the world and characters whereas all other mediums seem to be skimming the surface.

However, there is some truth to 'a picture is greater than a 1000 words'. I do have trouble at times picturing certain scenes in books but when it's on screen, everything just makes sense.

I especially love how the tv industry adapts the fight scenes as in books it seems to be very slow and unrealistic. In a real fight I don't think you'll have time to have all those thoughts. You're only thinking about surviving.

Anyway, that's just what I think.",books,1413
"I normally buy my books on a few different sources (namely Kobo and Amazon) and then convert them to ePub and copy them onto my phone so I can read directly off that. 

Lately Blue Fire Reader hasn‚Äôt been appearing in the file sharing section of iTunes so I can no longer copy books across to that. I‚Äôve been making do reading books in the dedicated app I‚Äôve bought them from. But I‚Äôd really prefer to keep them all in one app rather than have multiple. 

Does anyone know of a fix for this or an app like Blue Fire Reader that allows you to sync books across?",books,560
"If there's one thing my English teachers through high school and university told me that I can't forget, it's the idea of rereading a book when studying it. I cannot COUNT the amount of times a teacher told me ""you wont understand this book initially. you'll need to read it at least twice but preferably more. 

At the time, I always just thought wow, what an absolute waste of time. It seemed to me, and still does, like a sure-fire way to absolutely hate a novel. I never read a book twice in all of high school or when getting my BA in English. What's worse is that, because I understood the value of taking notes during the first reading, all my teachers and tutors commented on my strong understanding of a text, just because they couldn't fathom that the books chosen by the school board specifically for an age-group were obviously not ""too complicated"" for them.

Has anyone else experienced this? What are your thoughts on rereading texts within a short timeframe for the sake of study?",books,996

I'm curious as to which book actually got you hooked onto reading. I remember reading a lot of books as a kid but never got into it until 4th grade.

Remember the Percy Jackson movie? Yeah, looking back it was God awful but I remember that as a kid I loved it. So then I found out it was a book series and I started reading it.

I was wondering if literature would be something I would enjoy, I recently decided to look at how to write in iambic pentameter out of curiosity as I never learned it in school despite it being taught in the class, I never understood it. Now that I am a bit older and looked into it with a little more intrigue I realized that it was actually very difficult to try writing something with any kind of meaning. I would like to learn more about literature and maybe learn to love and admire it. I have a close friend whom has a deep interest and admiration for literature and I would like to give it a chance because they really do find it amazing. I started reading recently and read iRobot by Asimov which I found to be quite interesting and easy to read, however a few weeks later now I am trying to read To Kill a Mockingbird which I have read everywhere to be a good book but I am not finding myself all that interested in the story, I really like the characters and their strong sense of morality but I am finding it hard to enjoy the book and carry on reading it, I was wondering if maybe reading wasn't really for me?",books,1333

"I'm looking for some best-practices and ideas for doing this. I've noticed that if I am reading 3-4 books at a time (which I enjoy doing), one book may go on the back-burner for a few days or even weeks if I don't make a conscience effort to return to it. I thought about how in college, typically a professor would assign however many pages of a book for homework, which is a lot more manageable than just reading however much I feel like of a text.

Does anyone actually schedule/self-assign their reading in such situations? Like: on Tuesday and Thursday, read 50 pages of X book and on Monday and Wednesday, read 20 pages of Y book.

"I expected it to throw in a plot twist and end with some interesting ambiguity.  Instead, hardly any resolution was reached and it‚Äôs vagueness feels like a facade, covering up the story‚Äôs messiness and lack of depth.

Earlier I skimmed through some ‚Äúdiscussions‚Äù of the story, none of which did much discussing.  Perhaps it is a story that‚Äôs meant to be an allegory for life, a nonsensical journey you just experience, but surely someone has a theory that ties together all the loose ends?

Some things that confuse me are (sorry for the length, I‚Äôm just baffled):

The cat‚Äôs bent tail, which Malta Kano was shown with in the main character‚Äôs final dream.  They said that maybe the cat wasn‚Äôt the same cat.

The fashion designer husband being murdered and having his organs taken in the hotel room.  Is there any connection to the room that we kept visiting in the dreamlike state? Any connection to the tigers‚Äô organs being taken by the Chinese workers after the zoo massacre?

The old man told a tale that ended with some secret papers being buried by a river during the war.  Any link here?

All the women that mysteriously visit the main character are eventually described to be like Kumiko. Why?

What was going on when the women would visit the main character and lick the blue mark on his face?

Who did he beat with the bat at the very end in the hotel?

What was up with the scene at the hotel where the news reports that someone just like him beat Noburo Wataya with a bat?  Could he be delusional and that was the real thing that happened?

When Cinnamon was young, he saw the two men bury a still-beating heart under his tree, and the shorter man climbed it, never to return.  And why did this cause him to lose his voice?

Are each of the characters an animal?  The Wind-Up Bird, the cat... many of them are related to an animal at some point.  Wataya‚Äôs fat minion named Bull is related to a bird, bull, and dog.

Why did the mark appear after being burned by the bright light?  Why did it disappear after being stabbed?

Why does Creta Kano say her child is both the main character‚Äôs and Mamiya‚Äôs?

What was it that Wataya did to Creta when he stuck something inside her and pulled something out?

May Kasahara‚Äôs entire character confuses me to no end, too.

Are some scenes true and others a delusion or dream?  Could the main character be a reincarnation or dead?  Is the wind-up bird like the grim reaper, or something like you hear it‚Äôs cry and are cursed?  Could all of this be a story that Cinnamon was writing, like Stranger Than Fiction?

"Greetings,

I‚Äôm in my early 40s.  I grew up reading books all the time.  Throughout my adult life, I‚Äôve mixed educational/history books with entertaining/fiction novels.

However, as time goes on, I find myself reading less and less.  I find myself watching videos on YouTube, etc more and more.  This is bothering me ‚Äî some thoughts I‚Äôm having:

Modern books suck:

-It seems like authors nowadays take forever to get to their point they are trying to make.  Or they repeat the same thoughts over and over.  This makes reading boring and tedious.  I suspect that there is a lot of pressure on authors by publishers to hit a certain ‚Äòpage count‚Äô in order to justify a given selling price.  I suspect there is also more pressure to release books more quickly then in the past.

-It‚Äôs hard to describe, but many books I‚Äôve read recently just seem poorly written.  Almost like they‚Äôre prose attempts written by elementary school students.  A few months ago I was reading a fiction novel, and was immediately turned off by the author‚Äôs writing style, but I decided to keep going and have an open mind.  A little while later my wife stopped behind me and read the page I was on, and commented that the writing was terrible.  I thought: ‚Äòthank god it‚Äôs not just me!‚Äô

-I don‚Äôt think authors/writers are as good as they used to be.

The problem is me, or the Information Age:

-I really enjoy watching documentaries, interviews, and TedTalks online.  It‚Äôs a great way to get info on a topic I‚Äôm interested in.  Maybe this is making me start to resent reading - I don‚Äôt want the ‚Äòfluff‚Äô anymore, I just want the facts.  A good example is Chernobyl:  I liked the TV show and recent videos talking about it, but unfortunately reading recent books on the topic bores me to tears.

-As I age, I worry I‚Äôm becoming somewhat jaded ... a bit of a nostalgic asshole?  Maybe it‚Äôs normal for writing styles to change over time, and my unwillingness to accept this is to blame?

I assume it‚Äôs a combination of both issues - but I‚Äôm very curious what other people think about this.  Am I the only person who feels this way?  Any recommendations to help me enjoy reading more again (aside from just ignoring new books and only reading old ones)?",books,2224

"I'm a big reader of almost everything. Currently, I am reading ""Poetics"" with four different students who are preparing for their junior years in High School. These teens are not typically readers in the sense that they don't do very well with reading in between the lines of texts and seeking the deeper meaning. To them, books are largely about exactly what they are about, and nothing more. 

Enter Aristotle. The chapter on tragedy. For some reason, this section really spoke to them. Maybe it's Aristotle's penchant for taxonomies and characterising everything. Maybe it was his ideas on mimesis. I have a strong gut feeling that it was how Aristotle thinks of catharsis. When I was in school, I had always heard of catharsis as being this purifying thing that people seek in order to cleanse themselves from sins. If they feel guilty, they seek out Oedipus Rex to make themselves feel better. 

Even though Aristotle never says what catharsis really is in Poetics, I think a more accurate reading of his idea of catharsis is that you use catharsis in watching tragedy to ""refine"" or ""purify"" your perception of what is right or wrong. When you internalise the tragedy that the character goes through, this fear and pity recalibrate your ability to recognise how to act morally, and you take that with you and learn from it. 

In discussing with the teen readers, this made a lot of sense. One was even saying that Aristotle is refreshing in tehe world of IG and social media he lives in. He said something like, ""It's kind of like these days you don't get catharsis, you don't get any real insight from people. You just argue with people and that just makes it worse. Aristotle's idea was that you learn from reading, you don't just digest it.""

"Trying to find a copy of Peter Darling by Austin Chant, found a copy on Amazon for ¬£100+ and when I tried to look on American amazon it was $200+. Which is a crazy price for a book published in 2017.

I can't find the book anywhere else, not even as an ebook. This isn't the first book I've had this struggle with. 

Even though it's not as recent Stone Butch Blues was one that was similarly overpriced for a physical copy but free PDF because the author wanted it to be accessible. But nothing similar has happened with Peter Darling. 

Am I just looking in the wrong places or do some books only have limited copies released. But it has so many reviews on Amazon I find that hard to believe.",books,694
"The pandemic has definitely increased by ebook utilization at my local library.  Holds and reading what is immediately available have been great, but also the ""Lucky Day"" selection has been an exciting discovery for me.  Basically, high demand titles available for 14 day loans, no renewals, and they constantly rotate.  Is anyone else utilizing this feature?

My most recent ""Lucky Day"" reads:

*The Nickel Boys - by Colson Whitehead

*Devolution - by Max Brooks

*The Hate U Give - by Angie Thomas

*How to be an Antiracist - by Ibram X. Kendi

*The Underground Railroad - by Colson Whitehead

*The Topeka School - by Ben Lerner

*The Testaments - by Margaret Atwood

I really enjoyed all of these books, although ""The Topeka School"" was a bit of a slog.  My library has ebook and audiobook options, depending on the title.

I forget about time when I‚Äôm reading. I mostly read fiction, and I like to lose myself in the story. But when I close the book and return to my own life, a disappointment and sadness take over. I feel unsatisfied with my life because of the high and the adrenaline reading gives me, it is almost like an addiction. 
I have a pretty decent life. I have other hobbies as well, have a job, a boyfriend, family and friends but I still feel so jealous of the books. I don‚Äôt even know if it‚Äôs jealousy, but I know it makes me so uncomfortable and leaves me frustrated for some time. Especially after finishing a book, I walk around all moody and angry for no reason.
I read about experience-taking and I was feeling like it might be the reason. I feel so much for the characters and the story that it starts to affect my personal life but I cannot find any reason for all these negative feelings.

"**Books: The City of Brass -- The Kingdom of Copper -- The Empire of Gold**

Two years ago, wandering around a bookstore in Kolkata, I happened to come across a shelf on which sat The City of Brass. I don't like reading book jackets, so I flipped open the first page.

A couple of lines in, I could strongly feel the environment of a con-artist sitting in her fortune-telling tent in 1700s Cairo. I had previously read few fantasy books, and even less with a female protagonist. I drew up a stool and read the first chapter, after which I decided to buy the book and check out the rest of the story.

Fast forward to 2020, a couple of weeks ago the last book of the trilogy was published. I decided to re-read the previous two books before reading the last one. And overall, it was quite an enjoyable experience!

I do have some thoughts on the series, so I decided to write about the series in a categorized way - where I'd first talk about what worked for me (**The Great**), what I thought was fine (**The Acceptable**), and finally what didn't work for me (**The Not So Great**).

&amp;#x200B;

\############################

&amp;#x200B;

**The Great :**

**---&gt;** The immediate charm of a fantasy setting is the world-building, and I found the world-building aspects of the series to be quite enjoyable. Basically there's a four elements structure to the existence of all living entities. Humans are non-magical in this world, and are creatures of the earth. *Djinn* are magical creatures of fire, and they are the main group around whom the plot revolves in this trilogy. 

Then there are the super rare *Peris* (magical air creatures) and the probably mostly extinct *Marids* (magical water creatures). These later two creatures are so much more rare and powerful compared to djinn or humans, that they are revered almost as Gods. We get to see djinn interact with the concept of *Peris* and *Marids* throughout the trilogy, which is pretty interesting.

Otherwise most of the story is about the djinn, and specifically their political capital *Daevabad*. We get to see djinn from different races, leading to a greater complexity of the world. We get to see some races a lot more closely than others, which also opens up the possibility of future books in this world setting.

Additionally, there are half-blood djinns (with djinn and human parents), who get discriminated against by pure-blooded djinns, which contributes to the political plots of the trilogy.

As you can tell, there is a lot going on in this world, and the author does a pretty good job laying out the complexities in the world-building elements.

**---&gt;** The world-building leads naturally to complex political structures, and throughout the trilogy we get to see the rise and fall of different powers, and the fight of the oppressed and discriminated. The motivation behind every political act is discussed in detail, there are lots of scenes involving people in power planning their next steps, these scenes are always a delight to read.

**---&gt;** Most of what happens in the stories do not involve magic. Even most fights are with swords, so the lack of magic in most character interactions might actually make the trilogy more accessible to newer fantasy readers.

**---&gt;** One of the strengths of the author is to describe conversations between people in vastly unequal positions of power. In general, getting to see more powerful people strut around and make others nearly crap themselves has a fun aspect to it, but also, getting to see less powerful people try to assess a situation, and extract as much information as possible for their own benefit, without ticking off the more powerful, all of this leads to quite engaging scenes of conversations.

**---&gt;** The main three characters have an incredible journey. The con-artist from Cairo *Nahri* who discovers her powers place her in a very powerful position among the djinn. The djinn prince *Alizayad* who is sensitive to injustice, but being the second prince by birth, has very little power to bring about change. And the djinn from legends *Dara* with a horrible past looking for redemption. At the end of the trilogy, I reflected on the entire journey of each of the characters, and I thought, wow, what a journey each of them had. It is fascinating to see them go from where they were initially to where they finally end up, and every point of dispersion of their character is always very well motivated.

Even though Nahri has a central role throughout the trilogy, each of the characters have their own concurrent journey, and at the end of the trilogy, it does not feel like Nahri is more important than the other two. The author does manage to give each of the characters their own important place in the story, which is commendable.

**---&gt;** My favourite character, by far, is Alizayad. From the first book, I found Alizayad to be the most interesting, watching him struggle between his sense of injustice and what the political powers around him were deciding to do, it was all quite enjoyable. In terms of journey as well, I mean damn, Alizayad's overall journey is by far the most interesting, Nahri and Dara's overall journey actually ends up seeming much more simpler in comparison.

**---&gt;** I do like Nahri as a protagonist, and I did relate strongly to her motivations throughout the series. Sometimes, Nahri would react in ways that I would think was strange, and I'll talk about that later. But overall, the way she handles her position of power, her search for her identity, her place in the djinn world, it's really well done. Another thing I thought was really well done, was how the books handle the tricky question of forced marriage under strong political pressure. Associated with it is the question of sexual relations under forced marriages, and I think the book had a very mature way of handling it.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Acceptable :**

**---&gt;** Dara... is fine. He has a redemption arc, and he probably goes through the most agonizing of experiences, in comparison to Nahri or Alizayad. I... just didn't like him as a character much. I did empathize with his positions, and I do see the appeal of a handsome powerful legendary-status djinn. I guess arrogance turns me off quite a bit, but if it doesn't have that much of an effect on you, you might end up really liking him. Nevertheless, the plot of his character arc is pretty well done.

**---&gt;** The oppressed half-blood djinns have interesting plots in the first book, but the plots ends up tapering off in the later books. The trilogy is more character-oriented, and we do not have central characters directly affected by the plight of the half-blood djinns, so that might be why. It's a little strange, because it has a lot of importance in the world and to the central plotlines. Also in the second book we get to see them acquire weapons that cause a lot of damage to full-blood djinns. In the third book, we don't quite get a resolution to the weaponized half-blood djinns fighting for their freedom. I mean, it is addressed, but not quite directly and sufficiently.

**---&gt;** There is something *safe* about the third book. Which is fine, it's 2020, we're all going through a lot. By safety I guess I am implying that we get proper satisfying resolutions to all the important plotlines in the trilogy, and there are indeed quite a few plotlines. The characters do go through a lot, so by 'safe', I don't mean to imply that the characters have it easy. It's just, the nature of the resolution of most plot lines, are satisfactory. This point I'm making is also in line with my previous point about the half-blood revolutionaries, there's no way in my mind the half-bloods would end things on a peaceful note, there would be at least some who demand their own terms through violence. That doesn't happen, but the plots do get wrapped up.

**---&gt;** I think there is a trend in fantasy to move from monarchy towards political structures similar to a democracy. We get to see the beginnings of a bit of this in the third book. For me, it's always tricky, why would people accept a political structure they are not personally familiar with? I would have liked to see that addressed in the world. But the third book doesn't quite get into it, it only shows the beginnings of such a possible political structure, so I guess I'm fine with that.

**---&gt;** The third book fleshes out a lot regarding the magical elements of the world. I really enjoyed that. But, I would have also liked it more if there were threads of the magic and mythology that were not fully explained. It leads to a general feeling of mysticism, and a desire on my end to think and imagine more about those aspects of the world. I guess what I'm trying to say is, the explanations in the third book left me with less creative freedom when thinking about the possibilities in the world.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Not So Good :**

**---&gt;** The books have a few moments of action. I'm not very fond of action in books, a lot of time I find them difficult to follow and end up quite confused. The action descriptions improve with each book, I think they are pretty well written in the last book. However, almost half of the first book does involve Nahri and Dara running away from *ifrits*, and there's a lot of action going on, and it's probably the most dull part of the trilogy. Fortunately, the first book has alternate chapters on Alizayad, which are vastly more interesting. Once the chase subplot ends, the first book ends up becoming much more interesting.

**---&gt;** Most of the books involves conversations, which are mostly well written. Except one quirk, which would take me out of the reading flow every time. In conversations when characters feel distressed, they often react in what probably should be an honest and challenging way, but feels immature and oblivious of the power dynamics of the conversation. Any conversation between Nahri and Dara in the first book has examples of this. And this particular way of reacting, is also very similar, across different characters. Newer authors often end up writing characters that sound similar. That is not the case here in general. But in this one particular aspect, it kind of is. Otherwise the conversations are great.

&amp;#x200B;

\############################

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, **would I recommend the trilogy?** Yes, I would. If you like reading character and conversation-oriented stories with plotlines heavy in politics in a fantasy setting with complex world-building, I think you will like it.

**Would I re-read the trilogy again?** No, at least not in the immediate future. I did really enjoy the journey the characters go through. I think I might find myself flipping through a couple of sections of the first book, which has moments I found to be quite iconic. But I am interested in reading more fantasy, a lot of the booktubers I follow regularly recommend tons of fantasy books. I would like to try The Final Empire soon.",books,11040
"Hello there!

I have finally managed to get my hands on the last book in the trilogy ""Edge of eternity"". I started on the second book ""Winter of the world"" without really knowing this was a trilogy.

Is it a good way to learn history through fiction? What did you guys think about the book?

"The way I do reading currently is I write each paragraph in a big notebook while simultaneously listening to a podcast, and then re-read what I wrote and write a comment about it afterwards

I have a short attention span, so I can only imagine myself reading a series of text for a short amount of time. I tried reading Kafka on the Shore on the traditional way, and it lost me halfway because I got this burn-out feeling. That feeling made me stop reading it again and I don't want to have that kind of experience in my later years of reading books.

Each time I write is kind of a breathing point for me so I won't get burnt out like last time.

One might say that writing every paragraph and then writing my own comments about it is very ""consumptive"" (lack of better term), in my time, and money, but I found it to be more beneficial when I put it to perspective: I get to have better handwriting- which is good when I need it, and I also get to enjoy every word of that book.

I believe that skimming through 60 books in 2 months would just be as fun as reading 5 books in two months, I just chose the latter because I like going in-depth on what I'm reading.

I'm currently reading ""Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs"" for my Computer Science degree next 2 months and it helps me read a lot more words for longer time periods.

"So i thought about this question fairly recently.

Up until this year i wasn't really the biggest book nerd. I couldn't remember the last time i picked up something to read.
But that all changed (thank you literature teacher!).


In class I've had a chance to read few poems by Charles Baudelaire and other similar writers.
I thought about picking up ""Flowers of Evil"" by him because the poem we discussed really intrigued me.


But whenever i think about buying a poem book i always feel a bit repulsive. Because sometimes they tend to be very short.

I also feel like a lot of it is about metaphors and hidden meaning, and if i didn't have anyone to discuss it with i feel like the thrill of reading it wouldn't be used up well. Because I'll have all this knowledge about it and be very excited but not a person to tell it to.

Idk if I'm making sense lol

I guess I'm just unsure about weather or not i would like reading poetry. I mean, i could probably just buy it, because until you try it you can't know right?

"The theme ""Loss of innocence"" has me in a quandary now. Erstwhile I knew that it was a character arc where a character presented at the start is naive or extremely idealistic and through the action of the story gains knowledge, understanding and experience that alters behavior at the end. The developments could be both positive or negative in the way they affected a character. 

But I read an unsettling book of short stories about my conflict ridden homeland some days back. Believe me, At many places I had to close the book as I gasped and panted at the realities presented there. It was like someone had cut through the skin and fesh to reveal bare bones which shaped life in here. I felt like I had been in a pleasent stupor oblivious to such a facet of our society and now I'm wide awake.

"Hello friendly book lovers. I have been around this sub for awhile and one of the peculiar things that I observed is people asking ways for making reading a habit. I define habit as doing something consciously by the clock, everyday, so it will stick.

 Now I can understand that reading non-fiction books is a great method for building factual knowledge and readers in general have a stronger vocabulary and you want to do it everyday to perform better in these areas but more often than not people ask about making reading novels/stories a habit.

From my personal experience habituation lowered my enjoyment by ALOT. I would read every night, for 1-2 hours. The thing that I observed is that I would consciously tell myself ""now it's time to read"" and somewhat force myself to read the book in front of me, not paying attention to the feelings I had during the process. Long story short I dropped reading for a month after all that.

Nowadays I read a lot less but the feelings that, for me, should accompany the process are all there. I don't read everyday and I don't time it. I genuinely feel like a child again, it's a long time since I ""felt"" a story and was interested and excited about the world inside those pages.

What was your experience with making reading a habit? I would love to hear your opinions about this.
Sorry for any English mistakes, not my native language.",books,1383
"Reading more is a good goal, always. However, the way that I've seen ""reading more"" being discussed, especially on the internet is...just not good. The advice that people give on ""how to read more"" is almost always terrible, such as speed ""reading"", audiobooks, skimming etc. And these are fine methods when, say, you have to go through a textbook for a test and you don't have enough time, but for reading in general, as an activity, it's just bad.

It's almost as if reading has become an intellectual status symbol in the society, and the more books you read, the smarter you are perceived to be. So the end goal is to just read as many books as you can, without regard to the enjoyment and the actual reading experience.

You'd never find a cinephile saying ""Yeah, I generally skip over some parts of film to get to the meat and like read the Wikipedia summary to help, that's just so that I can watch as many films as possible."" 

People forget that at the end of the day, reading is a consumptive activity. Can it, in general, be more demanding than other consumptive activities like watching films and listening to music? Yes, absolutely. But it's still a consumptive activity, so applying the kind of strategy that one applies for doing productive work -- like how to study more, how to work more, how to practice more (an instrument, for example) is not good, in my opinion.

The best experience is to go through a book slowly. Read each and every line, and let it settle in your mind. If you like a sentence/para, or if you don't fully understand it read it twice, thrice. It's better to closely read one book per year than to skim over a hundred.

"I had nothing to do for the entire month of june. No online classes or anything. I saw a guy do this on YouTube but I was kinda disappointed because he did use audiobooks and read much shorter books. He also didnt read one book a day.

So I decided to do this and make it actually challenging. 

Day 1: The book thief by Markus Zusak

Picking a 600 page book on the first day was probably not the wisest idea. I loved this tho and I did cry like a little bitch.

Day 2: Behind her eyes by Sarah pinborough

It was fine. Like neither good or bad.

Day 3: The silent patient

I hated this one. Its probably one of the most popular psychological thriller but it was just bad. There is a twist but it only works cause the author purposely left stuff out. Also who writes the exact lines people say in their diary? Whatever, not a fan.

Day 4: The woman in the window

I dont know if its it's because I've read an ungodly amount of thrillers but I've started to find them...not thrilling. It wasnt bad 

Day 5: Crime and punishment by Foydor dostoevsky 

Loved it. Needed a good one after 3 days of total duds.

Day 6: Lolita

This book fucked me up. There's this uneasiness that lingers for quite sometime after reading it. One of the most dark and twisted books ever.

Day 7: The shining by stephen king

I'm not a huge stephen king fan but I got a bunch of them as a gift. It was actually quite good. 

Day 8, 9 and 10: Red dragon, silence of the lambs and Hannibal by Thomas Harris.

This has been on my TBR for years now. I don't know if it was because my expectations were super high or what but I was kinda disappointed. Still a decent read.

Day 11: The murder of Roger Ackroyd by Agatha Christie.

I was NOT in a reading mood that day. I had really bad cramps so I decided to read something I'd already read. It was good obviously. Agatha christie always kills it. 

Day 12: Three weeks to say goodbye

It was an ok thriller. Kinda boring though.

Day 13, 14 and 15: This was a man by Jeffree Archer, Camino Islands by John Grisham and False impressions by Jeffree Archer.

I have nothing to say except these were all very very average.

Day 16: Room by Emma donaghue.

Thrillers are such a hit or miss for me and this was a surprising hit. Its from a pretty unique perspective, enjoyed this one.

Day 17: Lisey's story by stephen King.

Ngl Stephen King is kinda growing on me. I did like this alot.

Day 18: eleanor and Park by Rainbow Powell.

I usually wouldn't read a YA romance but I was pleasantly surprised. The characters are super likable and nice break from all the murder.

Day 19: The idiot by Fyodor Dostoevsky.

Super long. I did have to wake up early and read for like 5 hours straight. Good read.

Day 20: The Outsider by Stephen king 

Ok fine I'm a stephen king fan.

Day 21: We need to talk about Kevin 

I actually really liked this one. The unreliable narrator thing was done perfectly.

Day 22: Sharp objects by Gillian Flynn

I actually haven't read Gone girl (It got spoiled for me) so I had no idea what to expect from this but it was actually good.

Day 23: The Andromeda Strain by Michael Chrichton.

Meh

Day 24: Johny got his gun by Dalton Trumbo

Holy shit. One of the darkest books I've ever read. 

Day 25: The ballad of songbirds and snakes by Suzzane Collins

This is a prequel to the Hunger Games trilogy, so the bar was high. And it's super disappointing. Ahhh I wanted this book to be good so badly. oh well

Day 26: The God delusion by Richard Dawkins.

This is probably the most popular book on atheism. I have nothing against the arguments but this book could have done without the superiority complex. 

Day 27: The plague by Albert Camus

I was kinda scared to read philosophy in English because it isnt my native language and I was worried I wouldn't get it. But I did and I loved it!

Day 28: The pig island by Mo Hayder.

I picked this up on a whim and I was surprised....not in a good way though. This book sucks 

Day 29: The stranger by Albert camus.

I actually read this in French which also isnt my native language. It was a little harder to understand but a good read nonetheless.

Day 30: The stand by stephen King

Finally for the last day I wanted to really challenge myself. This book is well over a 1000 pages long. I had to wake up at 5am and basically read for the entire day. I did end up finishing it at 11:45 PM. That was one stressful day lol.

Final thoughts: This was definitely a once in a lifetime kinda thing mainly because I dont think I'm gonna have a month with nothing to do or nowhere to go anytime soon.

For especially the long books I kinda felt like I was swallowing words. Books are better when you kinda let them ""sit"" with you. If you're a basic bitch like me who reads only one genre, you will end up mixing up the plots.

But this also allowed me to read books that I normally wouldn't. especially the ones I got as gifts.

That's probably the stupidest part of this obsession, but for me, looking through the index helps refresh the concepts that the book discussed. Besides their (occasional) usefulness, the front and back matter just feel like integral parts of a book. It doesn't feel right to leave the book without reading all it has to offer (even if nothing useful turns up). It's satisfying to put down a book knowing I read its every word, and I have a twinge of guilt if I don't read the entire book beyond the main text.

"Listen, I just gotta know if there are any other sick bastards out there. So tell me, do you ever get a new book, and you‚Äôre so excited to begin and jump into the story, so you crack it open. But then... 

There is an insatiable urge to flip through to the *very* end. Well you just started, right? Yet you just *have* to read the last page, maybe even the last chapter. You try to fight the urge, but it‚Äôs too late as you flip through the last 50 pages and find the last page. Maybe you sneak in a few words and then stop, for surely this is a mistake. But you just got a taste, how could you stop now? And before you know it, you are crouched over your book in shame reading the last page before you even started the first chapter.

On a real note, I do this every single time, and I have spoiler alerted myself more than once because of this habit. oops",books,856
"Hi all! I'm looking for a book that will make me feel something- usually the easiest way to accomplish this for me is sadness. I've been in a bit of a reading rut and i think a compelling and emotional story (fictional or not) is just the thing i need.

"So I am not much of an organizational person- but recently the urge to read more has taken over and I‚Äôve been for some odd reason reading online PDFS from archive.org or ePubs of books instead of reading the books stacked around my house . I decided a good way to deal with this would be getting a Kindle - however - I am not allowing myself to get a Kindle until I read and de clutter at least half my books.
I am planning on making a list or a spread sheet - not everything will be going . There will be different categories - classics that are free / low price on most platforms now will definitely be de cluttered unless it is a favourite and special edition like my copy of Jane Eyre. There will be a category for books I just really want physical copies of - like my large astrology reference book , and a category for more modern books that still mean a lot to me to keep and then ones I‚Äôve read and enjoyed but can be easily passed on . 
I may also add a notes section so I can write down what I liked about it , the genre etc or what I didn‚Äôt like about it to help myself read and identify my reading habits more critically.
After reading every book in my collection , writing in the sheet where it falls - I will then sort them as such and I‚Äôve if not gotten rid of enough I‚Äôm going to go through the whole process again until I‚Äôve narrowed it down . 
Then as a reward for all this and a reward for not buying physical books as an impulse what my plan is to get a nice kindle and then I will be able to read the free ePubs and purchase ePubs, as well as using my libraries online resources- ultimately saving myself some money , decluttering myself and reading a lot more !
Excited to start this journey , and also to read and think critically about what I like and don‚Äôt like in a book and my own buying of book habits as they are quite dismal with the amount of rather large splurges I do on books at random locations such as thrift stores . 
Thanks for reading !",books,1975
"I just read six of Joe Abercrombie's books in quick succession and was very impressed and intrigued by what he had to say on the nature of power and change as expressed by his characters, their traits, and behavior. 

A major theme of the Shattered Sea trilogy was the nature of power, who has it, why, how it works, and what it is, while in the First Law trilogy, power is still significant, yet takes more of a backseat to a commentary on the nature of people and how they don't fundamentally change. 

In addition, I found comparisons between characters in the two trilogies particularily interesting, the most obvious of which would be the parallels between Yarvi and Glokta. 

I wanted to start a general discussion about these books, because I think they're entertaining yet powerful literature. To start out a discussion, Ill ask a question below, but I'd like to hear any thoughts at all on the books. 

I saw in the Shattered Sea more of an acceptance of character evolution, and a more subtle conmentary on the way power corrupts and creates cycles, whereas a pointed cyclicism was very prominent in First Law. How do you see the themes of Abercrombie's writing evolve between the two trilogies, and do you like the way they do? Why?",books,1243
" I have a bunch of plays that I would really like to read (some works by Aristophanes, Euripides, Plautus). I already read The Clouds by Aristophanes (with footnotes and introduction) and I can see why his work is so important and appreciate it, but I fear that I'm missing something. Same for the other authors, I read Hyppolitus by Euripides and I felt the same. I am very familiar with greek mythology so plot, characters and context of the play are not the problem (or at least in tragedies; in comedies there's also the humor factor that is often reached through word play, so probably is just that I can't appreciate them fully because I'm reading translations that can't get to the same level of the original text)

Do you know any books that can introduce me to ancient tragedies and comedies, and maybe give me more of a historical context?

Thank you",books,860

"Fantasy is my favorite genre to read. Always has been. Life can be a bit dull, and my over active imagination as a kid was a good escape. When I became old enough to read books that had these alternate worlds developed that I could escape too - I was stoked. 

I‚Äôm in my mid thirties now, and still read fantasy a bit but the success rate is pretty low. I get so tired of series starting the same way. You are following around with the main character who is just being introduced to the world, and there are four chapters of so called shocking discoveries. Yah, I figured that person was a wizard based on the cover art, let‚Äôs shake off the surprise and move along. And he‚Äôs a wizard so don‚Äôt be surprised by every new magically thing you see him do, main character. 

Anyone feel me? Some books do a great job of throwing you right into the middle of it. They are harder to figure out in the first few chapters because the character names get confusing, and you‚Äôre trying to keep up, but at least it feels a little more real. If you were dropped off at another planet, and some point you‚Äôll have to nod and play along to not draw attention to yourself.",books,1153

"So after hearing so much about this beloved classic from everyone and their mother AND father I decided to give it a try. Unfortunately, I did not enjoy it. 

First thing is first, this book felt like a non-fiction to me in general. Don't get me wrong, it has a fictional formula but the writing felt too factual and had an essay-like quality. This contributed to my lack of enjoyment.

The second gripe I have with this novel is the ""tell not show"" aspect to the story. Since it is a dystopian novel, I was expecting things to be shown as they happened (with action) not endless amount of exposition. Only the last part of the book felt like it had fulfilled what I wanted it to see in the book. 

The other thing: the characters. I guess in a setting as hopeless and upsetting as this you wouldn't expect alot from the characters but you can empathise with them at least. But in this book, I felt absolutely no connection to any of the characters and the main character felt like the embodiment of annoyance. 

Smaller gripe: I was expecting to find hardhitting paralles between this book and our world today. Although I found really chilling similarities, it wasn't as impactful as I thought it would be. 

Overall: 1984 didn't feel as groundbreaking as everyone say it is",books,1275
"So, I just finished this book, and I loved it. It‚Äôs my first Coben, and I‚Äôm most definitely going to read more from him. It was fast paced and intriguing all the way through.

"I don't recall who recommended The Hike or why I picked it up (or downloaded it, as the case is), but I had no idea what to expect. There was a bit of a hint, I suppose: this guy goes on a hike and it gets weird. Oh, and it's great science fiction (or fantasy?). 

That was about it. And it's got to be the most understated premise to a book I can recall in a while. Because what happens to Ben is so much more vivid, bizarre, and, well, fascinating. I don't know what to expect from one chapter to the next, but it's not boring or predictable, and Ben is a surprisingly sympathetic character (though he's got to be the first middle-aged suburban dad to take a leading role in a fantasy/science fiction that I can recall).

"Apologies if this has been posted before or recently, but I‚Äôm curious to hear about your first book loves and reasons why. For me, it was the Island of the Blue Dolphins by Scott O‚ÄôDell. It was assigned reading in primary school and I remember becoming obsessed with this story which is about a 12-year-old Native American girl (Karana) stranded alone on an island off the California coast for years. I credit this book for turning me into an avid reader. I was always drawn to strong and resilient female characters from a very young age, and Karana was pretty much the epitome of that.

"First I saw the movie - loved every minute of it. I had not heard of the book before. Found it at the library a couple of weeks ago and read reviews on line prior to starting it. The reviews varied from ""boring, badly written"" to ""superb"". Very strange, so I dived in and found myself in an enthralling history lesson about Poland in WW2, the horrors of life in the Warsaw ghetto, and the bravery &amp; fears of the people fighting in the anti-Nazi resistance.
This is the story about zookeepers Jan and Antonina Zabinski who saved over 300 people from the death camps of the Holocaust. And how amid ever-present danger, Antonina managed to keep her unusual household of humans and animals afloat - as Europe crumbled around them. I thoroughly recommend it as a ""must read"". The movie too, as it captures the true essence of the story.",books,835
"Don Quixote was written in two parts by Spanish author Miguel de Cervantes, a soldier who was captured during the battle of Lepanto by the Ottomans, reached fame and died in poverty leaving behind the crown of Spanish literature.

Don Quixote is widely recognized to be one of or the best book in the world, practically everyone knows the story of the mad hidalgo Don Quijote and his companion Sancho Panza and their tragi-comedic adventures through Spain, the novel is constructed around the contrast between the idealism of Don Quijote and the simplicity of the world he lives in, the scene of the windmills amd giants is the best example of this, a history of illusion and disillusion, however Don Quijote remains firm to his pourpose, in an oddly inspiring way

But Don Quijote is much more than a set of comedic adventures, but an outstanding literary revolution never seen again. In contrast with the novels previous to Cervantes the common everyday aspects of life are showed time and again during the book, inaugurating the realism genre.

But perhaps the most amazing thing of the book is Meta-fiction, present mostly in volume 2 as the characters are aware of the publication of the first part, Cervantes uses the second part to point at a fake second part written by Avellaneda, to do so he uses meta-fiction in the cleverest way possible. After all the wit, the comedy and Meta-fiction come the serious issues, the expulsion of the moriscos portrayed in the second volume was shocking for everyone in Spain. At the end the idealism shatters and Don Quixote dies in one of the saddest passages of literature, we are left with tears on our eyes and an unforgettable book",books,1680

"A while ago I was watching a video about writing, and a comment on it really interested me. I screenshotted the comment but don't remember the video. It said this:

""It'd be interesting to explore the distinction between being a good writer and being a good storyteller. They're often conflated but they're not exactly the same thing. I've read authors who are technically proficient and have an incredible ability to write the most amazing descriptions, but they're sorely lacking in storytelling chops. Then there are certain writers who don't write the most gorgeous, scintillating prose. In fact, their prose could be considered a lot more basic, or their grammar flawed, but they have a talent for writing addictive stories that keep you turning the pages.""

I'd say I'm a pretty decent writer. My writing strong-suit is describing things, whether it be feelings, places, characters, actions, etc. I'd like to think my storytelling is good too, but this comment really made me think.

Well, allow me to explain with a metaphor.

In the gaming community we have pages and many websites which portray the newest or most expected games of the season.

"First published together in 1794 then published again as part of the Penguin Classics/Cloth-bound classics series in 2017.

This book is my first on Victorian poetry and honestly, it's felt more like a chore than a joy to read.

I bought it on a recommendation as a way of getting used to the Victorian style of writing because I struggled with ""The Vampyre"" by John Polidori which is also written in the same format. 

For a relatively short book at just over 100 pages its taken me a month to the date to finish it.

I'm neither a strong reader nor a weak reader, let's say middle ground, and my preference for reading is graphic novels and comics.

The layout inside the book is half text and the other half is illustrations next to their respective poems.

While reading through I tried keeping a steady pace and timing to then be slowed down by another word that needed to be pronounced differently for the passage to make sense with the rhyming.

One poem that stood out in-particular for me is called ""The Ecchoing Green"". As I read it I couldn't help but build up a very detailed mental image of the scenes that were being described line by line in poem.

So, if I‚Äôm in a bookstore and something catches my eye, I‚Äôll just pull out my phone really quick and look up the title to see if it has a decent rating (3+ is decent enough for me).

The cover had tall red rock in the background and then a bird, maybe a phoenix or an eagle was flying in the sky. Large enough on the cover that it was close in the forefront.

The story line was that the world had ended and there were 7 (I think seven) teenagers left in the world that ended up having to find each other. I think they were purposefully in a deep sleep because they were chosen to continue humanity after everyone else had died. I think there was a religious base to the story, but I'm unsure if that's because there really was or because I was raised in a religious home and the book made the cut to be read to us as children. 

That's basically all I can recall... It was read to us in the early 2000's so it was written probably in the 90's or early 2000's.
